   62 y/o M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   and OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement.  Now stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and
   appropriate pressures.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - f/u IP recs with plan for 3 days of intubation followed by
   replacement of stent
   - steroids for airway inflammation as below
   - abx for pneumonia treatment as below
   .
   # Stent Displacement: s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal this
   evening.  Was likely a consequence of intubation.  Has stable airway
   now and reintubated.
   - decadron 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days
   - remain intubated with plan for stent replacement in several days
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-aquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - vanco, levofloxacin
   - add flagyl for anerobic coverage because of immunesuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - check urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus tonight
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone in spite of decadron for now
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of his tracheal stent. He underwent rigid bronchoscopy and stent removal, and is now stable on a ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to further hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia, particularly given his history of aspiration and immunesuppression.
3. Stent Displacement: The patient's airway may become compromised, leading to respiratory failure or other complications.
4. ARF: The patient's renal function is declining, and he may require further treatment and management to prevent progression to acute kidney injury.
5. Immunesuppression: The patient's immunesuppression may increase his risk of infection, particularly given his history of renal transplantation.
6. DM: The patient's blood sugar levels may become labile and require closer monitoring and management.
7. HTN: The patient's blood pressure may fluctuate and require closer monitoring and management.
8. CAD: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate, leading to further complications.
9. Hx of CVA: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate, leading to further complications.
10. Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: The patient's cognitive function may deteriorate, leading to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to cover for hospital-acquired pathogens.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
4. Continue immunesuppressive therapy and monitor for signs of infection.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensive medications as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation regimen as necessary.
9. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis medication to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and update them on his condition and treatment plan."

   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - sliding scale
   - consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril, monitor overnight
   - hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - hold home sedating psych meds while intubated
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, PICC possibly tomorrow
   # Communication: wife, daughter (phone numbers in chart)
   # Code:  Full (discussed with wife)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent.

The patient's current status is:

* Respiratory: Stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. The plan is to continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid hyperventilation, wean FiO2 as tolerated, and wean sedation.
* Cardiovascular: Normotensive, with a plan to hold enalapril and monitor overnight.
* Renal: ARF with Cr increasing to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3. The plan is to f/u urine lytes, f/u renal transplant team recs, hold enalapril, and IVF bolus prn.
* Immune: Immunosuppressed due to chronic immunesuppression, which puts him at risk of uncommon infections. The plan is to continue cellcept, prograf, and bactrim ppx.
* Endocrine: Labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and after getting steroids. The plan is to continue home lantus, sliding scale, and consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight.
* Infection: Pneumonia likely due to aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as a result. The plan is to treat with vanco, azithro, and cefepime, and consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage.
* Neurological: Sedated, but moving all extremities. The plan is to hold home sedating psych meds while intubated and continue SSRI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or aspiration
* Cardiac complications due to CAD and immunesuppression
* Renal failure due to ARF and immunesuppression
* Infections due to immunesuppression and chronic medical conditions
* Neurological complications due to anoxic brain injury and sedation
* Gastrointestinal complications due to NPO and immunesuppression

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid hyperventilation
* Wean FiO2 as tolerated
* Wean sedation
* Repeat CXR in AM
* F/u IP recs with plan for 3 days of intubation followed by replacement of stent on Monday
* NPO after midnight tonight
* Steroids for airway inflammation
* Abx for pneumonia treatment
* VBG this afternoon
* Monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
* F/u urine lytes
* F/u renal transplant team recs
* Hold enalapril
* IVF bolus prn
* Continue cellcept, prograf, and bactrim ppx
* Continue home lantus and sliding scale
* Consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: IP recommended extubation in the OR tomorrow or Tuesday.
   Unable to place PICC at bedside, scheduled for IR.
   Put back on A/C due to low minute ventilation in setting of receiving
   fentanyl / versed.
   VS notable for BP 102-31-133/56, RR12.  AC 550x10/5/50%.  I/O +500cc.
   ABG 7.35/47/135.  Lactate normal.
   Exam: opens eyes to voice.  RRR S1 S2.  Crackles B/L bases.  1+ edema.
   Labs: 26 <- 28 <- 32.  WBC up to 12 from 10.  Cr 1.2 from 1.6
   Meds: dex, fentanyl gtt, versed, cellcept, bactrim, sc heparin, vanc,
   azithro, cefepime, seroquel, metoprolol
   62M Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p vfib arrest anoxic brain
   injury, aspiration pna, renal failure s/p renal transplant,
   tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, iddm admitted with respiratory failure
   most likely aspiration / pna, c/b stent migration s/p removed.  Agree
   with treatment for HAP, would change to PSV or at least titrate down
   A/C to allow for likely baseline hypoventilation.  Plan for extubation
   in OR in next 1-2 days.  Guaiac stools and recheck Hct later today for
   ?blood loss anemia d/t GI bleed.
   PICC will need to be done by IR.  Current access through EJ.  ABG x2
   (done after rounds) arterial.  Bedside ultrasound confirmed placement
   in EJ, possible it may be reflux from old AV fistula / graft in L arm
   as meds infusing without difficulty and high pressure, blood from IJ
   not pulsitile.  Regardless have 2^nd PIV placed on R, if working will
   d/c EJ; hope to avoid temporary IJ / SCL while awaiting PICC.
   Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill: CC time 35 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   62 y/o M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   and OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement.  Now stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and
   appropriate pressures.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid
   hyperventilation
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - f/u IP recs with plan for 3 days of intubation followed by
   replacement of stent on Monday
   - NPO after midnight tonight
   - steroids for airway inflammation as below
   - abx for pneumonia treatment as below
   - VBG this afternoon
   .
   # Stent Displacement: s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal this
   evening.  Was likely a consequence of intubation.  Has stable airway
   now and reintubated.
   - decadron 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days
   - remain intubated with plan for stent replacement likely tomorrow
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - vanco, azithro, cefepime
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - sliding scale
   - consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril, monitor overnight
   - hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - hold home sedating psych meds while intubated
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, PICC possibly tomorrow

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: IP recommended extubation in the OR tomorrow or Tuesday.
   Unable to place PICC at bedside, scheduled for IR.
   Put back on A/C due to low minute ventilation in setting of receiving
   fentanyl / versed.
   VS notable for BP 102-31-133/56, RR12.  AC 550x10/5/50%.  I/O +500cc.
   ABG 7.35/47/135.  Lactate normal.
   Exam: opens eyes to voice.  RRR S1 S2.  Crackles B/L bases.  1+ edema.

   62M Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p vfib arrest anoxic brain
   injury, aspiration pna, renal failure s/p renal transplant,
   tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, iddm admitted with respiratory failure
   most likely aspiration / pna, c/b stent migration s/p removed.  Agree
   with treatment for HAP, would change to PSV or at least titrate down
   A/C to allow for likely baseline hypoventilation.  Plan for extubation
   in OR in next 1-2 days.  Guaiac stools and recheck Hct later today for
   ?blood loss anemia d/t GI bleed.
   PICC will need to be done by IR.  Current access through EJ.  ABG x2
   (done after rounds) arterial.  Bedside ultrasound confirmed placement
   in EJ, possible it may be reflux from old AV fistula / graft in L arm
   as meds infusing without difficulty and high pressure, blood from IJ
   not pulsitile.  Regardless have 2^nd PIV placed on R, if working will
   d/c EJ; hope to avoid temporary IJ / SCL while awaiting PICC.
   Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill: CC time 35 minutes.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The patient had a complication with stent displacement during intubation, which was resolved with rigid bronchoscopy and stent removal.

Current status:

* The patient is stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.
* He is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia treatment, and steroids for airway inflammation.
* His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and he is on chronic immunosuppression due to his renal transplant.
* He has labile blood sugars and is being treated with insulin and sliding scale.
* His blood pressure is normotensive, and he is on chronic medications for CAD, DM, and HTN.

Potential medical complications:

* Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing hospital-acquired pneumonia, particularly given his immunosuppressed state and chronic respiratory disease.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further respiratory support or intervention to prevent further deterioration.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further renal support or intervention to prevent further decline in renal function.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunosuppressed state, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic medications.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk for cardiac complications, particularly given his current respiratory and renal status.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and may be at risk for further neurological decline or complications.

Plan:

* Continue antibiotics for pneumonia treatment and steroids for airway inflammation.
* Wean FiO2 as tolerated and wean sedation.
* Repeat CXR in the morning and monitor PIPs and plateaus for signs of airway compromise.
* Consider adding flagyl for anaerobic coverage given the patient's immunosuppressed state.
* Continue IVF bolus prn and monitor urine electrolytes.
* Hold enalapril and metoprolol and monitor blood pressure overnight.
* Continue statin and aspirin for CAD.
* Continue SSRI and hold home sedating psych meds while intubated.
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and consider adding additional antibiotics if necessary.
* Consider adding insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory, renal, and neurological status closely and adjust treatment plans as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient has been stable in the ICU, with no significant changes in their vital signs or laboratory results. They continue to require mechanical ventilation and have been on pressure support all day. The PICC team was unable to place a PICC line at the bedside, and an IR PICC has been ordered. The patient's medications have been adjusted, and they are scheduled for extubation in the OR likely on Monday. They need to be NPO after midnight tonight.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delayed extubation: If the patient is not extubated on Monday as planned, it may lead to further respiratory compromise and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. PICC line complications: The IR PICC line may be delayed or unsuccessful, leading to potential bleeding or infection complications.
3. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated, and there is a risk of further hyperglycemia if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and any changes in their ventilator settings or oxygenation may lead to further respiratory distress.
5. Infection risk: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, due to their prolonged mechanical ventilation and compromised immune system.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rhythm remains abnormal, and any changes in their cardiac status may lead to further instability.
7. Nutritional compromise: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and further delays in their enteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition and further complications.
8. Delirium: The patient's delirium remains a concern, and any changes in their mental status may indicate further deterioration in their condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to and OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP. Now stable on ventilator with
   good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. Plan for stent replacement
   today.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid
   hyperventilation
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation

   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently re-intubated with stable
   airway, plan for stent replacement today
   - plan for stent replacement today, f/u IP recs
   - discuss need/duration of steroids with IP
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 8-10 days
   - continue azithromycin for now pending legionella antigen result
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril, monitor overnight
   - hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - hold home sedating psych meds while intubated
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: order for PICC line, currently EJ, PIV
   # Communication: wife, daughter (phone numbers in chart)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP. Now stable on ventilator with
   good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. Plan for stent replacement
   today.

   airway, plan for stent replacement today
   - plan for stent replacement today, f/u IP recs
   - discuss need/duration of steroids with IP
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 8-10 days
   - continue azithromycin for now pending legionella antigen result
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time

Summary:

The patient, a 62-year-old male, is a complex case with a history of CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and TBM. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The patient is currently stable on a ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. The plan is to replace the stent today.

The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including ARF, pneumonia, immunesuppression, DM, HTN, CAD, and dementia. He is on various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, antidiabetic agents, and immunosuppressants.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, and is at risk for further complications.
2. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further renal damage.
3. Immunesuppression: The patient is on chronic immunosuppressants, which puts him at risk for uncommon infections.
4. DM: The patient has labile blood sugars, and is at risk for further hyperglycemia.
5. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is currently under control, but he is at risk for further hypertension.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications.
7. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, and is at risk for further cognitive decline.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator, and is at risk for further respiratory complications.

The patient's care plan includes ongoing antibiotics for pneumonia, fluid management for ARF, and monitoring of blood sugars and blood pressure. The patient's immunosuppressants will be continued, and his renal function will be closely monitored. The patient's code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age] year-old admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory failure. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/39 mmHg. They are receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin, and have been placed on NPO status for IP stent placement on Monday.

The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL. They also have hyperglycemia, with a glucose level of 343 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 10.6 K/uL, and their platelet count is 63 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are responsive to stimuli and have a stable neurological examination.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation make them at risk for developing ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's high white blood cell count and hyperglycemia suggest that they may be at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a significant complication that requires close monitoring and management.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose level requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and critical condition make them at risk for developing pressure ulcers.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure make them at risk for developing pneumonia.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure make them at risk for developing VAP.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical condition make them at risk for developing DVT.
9. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical condition and need for mechanical ventilation make them at risk for developing stress ulcers.
10. Infection: The patient's critical condition and need for mechanical ventilation make them at risk for developing infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   and OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement.  Now stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and
   appropriate pressures.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid
   hyperventilation
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - f/u IP recs with plan for 3 days of intubation followed by
   replacement of stent on Monday

   .
   # Stent Displacement: s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal this
   evening.  Was likely a consequence of intubation.  Has stable airway
   now and reintubated.
   - decadron 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days
   - remain intubated with plan for stent replacement likely tomorrow
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - vanco, azithro, cefepime
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - sliding scale
   - consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril, monitor overnight
   - hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - hold home sedating psych meds while intubated
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, PICC possibly tomorrow
   # Communication: wife, daughter (phone numbers in chart)
   # Code:  Full (discussed with wife)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   and OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement.  Now stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and
   appropriate pressures.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid
   hyperventilation
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - f/u IP recs with plan for 3 days of intubation followed by
   replacement of stent on Monday
   - NPO after midnight tonight
   - steroids for airway inflammation as below
   - abx for pneumonia treatment as below
   - VBG this afternoon
   .
   # Stent Displacement: s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal this
   evening.  Was likely a consequence of intubation.  Has stable airway
   now and reintubated.
   - decadron 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days
   - remain intubated with plan for stent replacement likely tomorrow
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - vanco, azithro, cefepime
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - sliding scale
   - consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril, monitor overnight
   - hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - hold home sedating psych meds while intubated
   - continue SSRI

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the key information as follows:

* The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis.
* The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed via rigid bronchoscopy.
* The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.
* The patient has a diagnosis of hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia.
* The patient is also at risk for stent displacement and pneumonia.
* The patient has chronic immunosuppression due to a renal transplant and is on chronic immunosuppressive medications.
* The patient has labile blood sugars and is at risk for hypoglycemia.
* The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently well-controlled.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Pneumonia or pneumonitis due to aspiration
* Stent displacement or airway compromise
* Hypoxia or respiratory failure
* Sepsis or septic shock due to immunosuppression
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Hypertension or hypotension
* Cardiovascular complications due to coronary artery disease
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury
* Neurological complications due to anoxic brain injury or dementia

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, prior ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy, and the patient is currently stable on a ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the need for close monitoring and management.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia due to his aspiration event and the presence of a tracheal stent. He has a beta-lactam allergy, and the antibiotics being used may not be effective against all potential pathogens.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.6, indicating AKI. This may be related to his fluid status, underlying kidney disease, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Immunosuppression: The patient is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy due to his renal transplant, which puts him at risk for opportunistic infections. He has no signs of fever or sepsis at present, but close monitoring is necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has labile blood sugars, which may be related to his diabetes mellitus, the use of antibiotics, and the administration of steroids. Close monitoring and management of his blood glucose levels are necessary.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled, but he has a history of hypertension, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and prior ventricular fibrillation arrest, which puts him at risk for cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is necessary.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and dementia, which may increase his risk for neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, or cognitive decline.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunosuppressive therapy, urinary catheter, and the presence of a tracheal stent. Close monitoring and management of his infection risk are necessary.

In summary, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, AKI, immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, cardiovascular instability, neurological complications, and infection. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure his optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The stent was removed via rigid bronchoscopy, and the patient is currently stable on the ventilator.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a history of aspiration and likely had an aspiration event, which may have led to pneumonia. He has a beta-lactam allergy, and coverage for hospital-acquired pathogens is necessary.
2. **Stent Displacement:** The patient's stent was displaced during intubation, and there is a risk of airway compromise if not properly secured.
3. **Acute Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
4. **Anoxic Brain Injury:** The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury, which may have led to cognitive impairment and increased risk of complications.
5. **Diabetes Mellitus:** The patient has labile blood sugars, which may be exacerbated by antibiotics and steroids. Close monitoring of blood sugars is necessary.
6. **Hypertension:** The patient has hypertension, which may be exacerbated by steroids and other medications.
7. **Cardiovascular Disease:** The patient has CAD, which may be exacerbated by stress and other factors.
8. **Immunosuppression:** The patient is immunosuppressed due to his renal transplant, which increases his risk of infection.
9. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
10. **Sepsis:** The patient has a risk of sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state and potential infections.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue antibiotic coverage for pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's stent replacement and airway stability.
3. Wean the patient off sedation and respiratory support as tolerated.
4. Monitor the patient's blood sugars and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Continue steroids for airway inflammation and monitor for signs of airway compromise.
6. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Continue immunosuppressive therapy and monitor for signs of infection.
8. Consider adding flagyl for anaerobic coverage due to immunosuppression.
9. Monitor the patient's cognitive function and adjust therapy as necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. He underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal and tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or worsen if not properly managed.
2. Stent Displacement: The removal of the stent may lead to airway compromise, and the patient may require further management to prevent this complication.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event may have led to pneumonia, and he is at risk for developing hospital-acquired pathogens.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk for developing ARF, which may require further management.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient's chronic immunosuppression puts him at risk for uncommon infections, and he may require further management to prevent this complication.
6. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's labile blood sugars may require further management to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's HTN may require further management to prevent complications.
8. Cardiovascular Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD may require further management to prevent complications.
9. Dementia and Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's sedation and potential need for psychotropic medications may require further management to prevent complications.
10. Feeding Tube (FEN): The patient's nutritional needs may require further management, including the possibility of PEG placement or small bore feeding tube placement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Now
   stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.
   - continue AC for now, will wean to PSV/trach mask
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation by stopping fentanyl drip. Will start clonazepam 0.5mg
   TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - f/u IP recs
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time.
   - discuss need/duration of steroids with IP
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 8-10 days
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses
 appears to be resolving with creatinine of 1.2
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF
   Possible PEG placement vs small bore feeding tube

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient is currently stable on a ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/38 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to an aspiration event with an aspiration pneumonia. He is currently stable on a ventilator, but will need to be weaned off the ventilator and transitioned to a tracheostomy mask.
2. Stent Displacement: The displacement of the tracheal stent during intubation may lead to airway compromise and require further management.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a question of pneumonia, which may be caused by hospital-acquired pathogens. He is currently receiving antibiotics, but will need to be monitored for signs of sepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from a baseline of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney damage. He will need to be monitored for signs of worsening kidney function.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient is on chronic immunosuppression due to his renal transplant, which puts him at risk for uncommon infections. He will need to be monitored for signs of infection and adjusted accordingly.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has labile blood sugars, which may be related to his antibiotics and steroids. He will need to be monitored for signs of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he will need to be monitored for signs of hypertension or hypotension.
8. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which may be related to his cardiac enzymes. He will need to be monitored for signs of cardiac instability.
9. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury, which may affect his cognitive function and behavior. He will need to be monitored for signs of worsening brain function.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, ARF, immunosuppression, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and anoxic brain injury. He will require close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy in the OR. They have a history of allergies to Lasix, Betalactams, and Haldol, and have received antibiotics, including cefipime and vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including fentanyl, famotidine, and heparin. They are on a ventilator with PSV/SBT mode, receiving 50% oxygen, and have a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/38 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 251 K/uL. Their liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 11-19 IU/L and an AST of 11-19 IU/L. Their kidney function is normal, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. Their glucose level is elevated, at 343 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator, and their respiratory rate is within the normal range, but their respiratory system is still at risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, but their laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate an underlying infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient has mild thrombocytopenia, which may increase their risk of bleeding.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, but their laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated potassium level, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which may increase their risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's blood pressure is within the normal range, but their heart rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate underlying cardiac complications.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has been experiencing periods of upper extremity contractions associated with diffuse diaphoresis, which are not responsive to morphine but resolve with versed. The patient has also had spontaneous breathing trials attempted, indicating a possible weaning from mechanical ventilation.

Physiological parameters:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 93 bpm (normal range: 61-93 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 78/49 mmHg (normal range: 78/21-215/182 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute (normal range: 7-23 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Lab results:

* White blood cell count: 10.6-12.3 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 8.9-12.3 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 251-251 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24-27 mmol/L (normal range: 2.5-8.5 mmol/L)
* Glucose: 206-334 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest a possible septic response.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels indicate a possible respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate levels suggest a possible cardiac dysfunction.
4. Neurological compromise: The patient's altered mental status and lack of movement suggest a possible neurological compromise.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and elevated creatinine levels suggest a possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's prophylactic anticoagulation therapy and elevated d-dimer levels suggest a possible venous thromboembolism.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest a possible infection.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and decreased bicarbonate levels suggest a possible metabolic acidosis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their physiological parameters, lab results, and potential medical complications. A comprehensive treatment plan should be developed to address the patient's underlying conditions and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Stabilized on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate
   pressures; now attempting spontaneous breathing trial.
   - Monitor outcome of spontaneous breathing trial
   - f/u IP recs
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - Continue home psych meds
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #5)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses
 appears to be resolving with creatinine of 1.2
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Stabilized on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate
   pressures; now attempting spontaneous breathing trial.
   - Monitor outcome of spontaneous breathing trial
   - f/u IP recs
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - Continue home psych meds
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #5)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses
 appears to be resolving with creatinine of 1.2
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed by interventional pulmonology, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient has been stabilized on a ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures, and is now attempting a spontaneous breathing trial. He has had several episodes of convulsions and diaphoresis daily, which have been managed with clonazepam and morphine.

The patient has a pneumonia, likely caused by an aspiration event, and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for 10 days. He has a beta-lactam allergy, and consideration is being given to adding flagyl for anaerobic coverage due to immunosuppression.

The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.6, and is at risk of developing sepsis. He is on chronic immunosuppression, which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, and is being monitored for signs of fever or sepsis.

The patient has labile blood sugars, which are being managed with sliding scale insulin and home lantus. He has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol, and has a history of coronary artery disease, which is being managed with aspirin and a statin.

The patient has a history of dementia and anoxic brain injury, and is sedated with fentanyl and versed. He has a tracheostomy, and is being considered for possible PEG placement or small bore feeding tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and aspiration event put him at risk of developing further respiratory failure, which could lead to ventilator dependence or even death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppression and acute renal failure put him at risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Infection: The patient's chronic immunosuppression and history of aspiration put him at risk of developing infections, which could be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and hypertension put him at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of anoxic brain injury and dementia put him at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of aspiration and immunosuppression put him at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition put him at risk of developing a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Stabilized on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate
   pressures; now attempting spontaneous breathing trial.
   - Monitor outcome of spontaneous breathing trial
   - f/u IP recs
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - Continue home psych meds
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #5)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses
 appears to be resolving with creatinine of 1.2
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation and had a complication with stent displacement. The patient has been stabilized on a ventilator and is now attempting a spontaneous breathing trial. He has had several episodes of convulsions and diaphoresis, which have been managed with clonazepam and morphine. The patient also has a history of dementia and anoxic brain injury, and is sedated with fentanyl and versed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration and had an aspiration event that led to respiratory failure. He is at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Stent displacement: The patient had a stent displacement during intubation, which was managed with rigid bronchoscopy and removal of the stent. He may need repeat stent placement in the future.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a question of pneumonia as a result of the aspiration event. He is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for 10 days, and will be followed up with sputum studies.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine has increased to 1.6, and he is at risk for developing ARF due to his medical history and current medications.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient is on chronic immunosuppression due to his renal transplant, which puts him at risk for uncommon infections.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient has labile blood sugars and is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis due to his diabetes and current medications.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and is at risk for developing neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage his convulsions and diaphoresis with clonazepam and morphine.
3. Continue to treat his pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime for 10 days, and follow up with sputum studies.
4. Monitor his renal function and adjust his fluid management as needed.
5. Continue to manage his immunosuppression and monitor for signs of infection.
6. Monitor his blood sugars and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
7. Monitor his cardiac status and adjust his medications as needed.
8. Monitor his neurological status and adjust his sedation regimen as needed.

Plan for Discharge:

The patient will likely require a rehabilitation program following discharge from the ICU. He will need to be followed up with his primary care physician and specialists, including his renal transplant team, and will need to continue his immunosuppression medications. He will also need to be monitored for signs of infection and cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Had
   been on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and
   this morning tolerating trach mask.
   - check VBG this AM
   - coordinate with IP
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - consider ativan if and if no benefit versed
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #5)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Improved with IVF Likely with creatinine of 1.2.
   Today clinically volume up.
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - consider diuretic
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, prior ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed by a bronchoscopist, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.3°C, HR 93 bpm, BP 78/49 mmHg, RR 22 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%
* Respiratory support: On ventilator with PSV/SBT mode, Vt 353-647 mL, PS 5 cmH2O, PEEP 0 cmH2O, FiO2 50%
* Laboratory results: WBC 10.6-12.3 x10^9/L, Hct 26-29.7%, Plt 251-63 x10^9/L, Cr 1.6-1.2 mg/dL, TCO2 24-27 mmHg, Glucose 343-251 mg/dL

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia
* Convulsions and diaphoresis, which are being managed with clonazepam and morphine
* Stent displacement, which was removed by bronchoscopy
* Pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics
* Acute kidney injury, which is being managed with IV fluids and consideration of diuretics
* Immunosuppression due to renal transplant, which puts him at risk of infection
* Diabetes, which is being managed with insulin and sliding scale
* Hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol and holding of enalapril
* Coronary artery disease, which is being managed with aspirin and statin
* History of cerebral vasospasm, which is being managed with statin

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued respiratory support with ventilator weaning
* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Management of convulsions and diaphoresis
* Monitoring of kidney function and consideration of diuretics
* Management of immunosuppression
* Management of diabetes and hypertension
* Monitoring of coronary artery disease and history of cerebral vasospasm
* Consideration of rehabilitation following discharge from the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to immunosuppression and pneumonia
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or airway obstruction
* Cardiac arrest due to coronary artery disease or electrolyte imbalance
* Renal failure due to inadequate kidney function or electrolyte imbalance
* Infection due to immunosuppression or indwelling devices
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or aspiration
* Neurological deterioration due to cerebral vasospasm or anoxic brain injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Had
   been on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and
   yesterday tolerated trach mask for only 6 hours.
   - SBT this morning and if patient does well, attempt trach mask again
   today
   - coordinate with IP
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #6)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal
   transplant aware of patient.  Improved with IVF Likely with creatinine
   of 1.0. Today clinically volume up.
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels; dose increased yesterday after program levels
   found to be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars continue to be elevated despite
   increase in lantus and ISS.
   - increase lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, hold TFs pending IR procedure, replete electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was intubated due to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia, and the stent was displaced during intubation. The patient was treated with rigid bronchoscopy and the stent was removed. He was weaned from the ventilator and restarted on CPAP, but developed wheezing and was treated with albuterol nebs. He continues to have episodes of muscle contractions and diaphoresis, which are managed with Versed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, anemia, and renal insufficiency. He is on chronic immunosuppression due to his renal transplant and is at risk for uncommon infections. He is also on medications for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, and there is a risk of progression to hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central line.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are labile, and there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central line.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and may be at risk for neurological complications.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of aspiration and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications.
10. Psychological complications: The patient has a history of dementia and may be at risk for psychological complications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide respiratory support as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and monitor for signs of progression.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust medications as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's immunosuppressed state and adjust medications as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medications as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medications as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's psychological status and adjust medications as needed.
10. Coordinate with the patient's primary care physician and other healthcare providers to ensure that the patient receives comprehensive care."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Had
   been on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and
   yesterday tolerated trach mask for only 6 hours.
   - SBT this morning and if patient does well, attempt trach mask again
   today
   - coordinate with IP
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to that.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #6)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal
   transplant aware of patient.  Improved with IVF Likely with creatinine
   of 1.0. Today clinically volume up.
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels; dose increased yesterday after program levels
   found to be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars continue to be elevated despite
   increase in lantus and ISS.
   - increase lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, hold TFs pending IR procedure, replete electrolytes
   Dophoff tube placement today in IR
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PICC line, PIV
   # Communication: wife, daughter (phone numbers in chart)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Had
   been on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and
   yesterday tolerated trach mask for only 6 hours.
   - SBT this morning and if patient does well, attempt trach mask again
   today
   - coordinate with IP
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to that.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #6)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal
   transplant aware of patient.  Improved with IVF Likely with creatinine
   of 1.0. Today clinically volume up.
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels; dose increased yesterday after program levels
   found to be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars continue to be elevated despite
   increase in lantus and ISS.
   - increase lantus
   - tighten sliding scale

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by the displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed by a rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient continues to experience episodes of muscle contractions, which are alleviated by the use of Versed. He also has episodes of diaphoresis, which are managed with clonazepam and morphine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood sugar levels, with a random glucose level of 343 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1c level of 29.7%. His creatinine level is elevated at 1.6 mg/dL, and he has a history of renal transplant.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely secondary to an aspiration event with an aspiration pneumonia.
2. Convulsions/diaphoresis: patient continues to have several episodes daily, which are managed with clonazepam and morphine.
3. Stent displacement: likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal.
4. Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as a result.
5. Acute renal failure: creatinine initially elevated to 1.6 mg/dL from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3 mg/dL.
6. Immunosuppression: patient is on chronic immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections.
7. Diabetes: patient has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and after getting steroids.
8. Hypertension: patient is normotensive today.
9. Coronary artery disease: patient has a history of CAD, and his EKG is without changes.
10. History of CVA: patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and is sedated.
11. Dementia: patient has dementia and is sedated with fentanyl and Versed.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central line.
2. Pneumonia: patient has a history of aspiration and is at risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): patient has a history of respiratory failure and is at risk of developing ARDS.
4. Renal failure: patient has a history of acute renal failure and is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central line.
6. Hypoglycemia: patient has labile blood sugars and is at risk of developing hypoglycemia.
7. Cardiac complications: patient has a history of CAD and is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Continue to manage the patient's seizures with clonazepam and morphine.
4. Continue to manage the patient's blood sugar levels with insulin and sliding scale.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with medication.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's immunosuppressed state and adjust his antibiotics and other medications accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication accordingly.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his sedation accordingly.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CHEST, AP: Dobbhoff tube has been advanced to the stomach. Other
   monitoring
   and support devices are unchanged in course and position. Airspace
   opacities
   in the lingula and left lower lobe have improved. Mild interstitial
   edema and
   cardiomegaly persist. There is no pneumothorax.
   IMPRESSION: Dobbhoff tube in place. Improvement in left basilar
   aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well.
   - prn nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   - check VBG
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #8)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c antibiotics if persistently elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker.
   - transition to PO lansoprazole
   # Access: PICC line, PIV

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM.
* He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement.
* He has a tracheostomy in place and is tolerating tube feeds and IV fluids well.
* His blood pressure is normotensive, and his respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 99%.
* He has a history of pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics, and is at risk for hospital-acquired pathogens.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a history of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, and is at risk for hospital-acquired pathogens. Continued antibiotic therapy is necessary to prevent progression of the infection.
2. **Volume Overload:** The patient's fluid balance is currently within normal limits, but he is at risk for volume overload due to his underlying medical conditions and IV fluids.
3. **Eosinophilia:** The patient's eosinophilia is being monitored daily, and antibiotics may need to be discontinued if the eosinophilia persists.
4. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient's creatinine level has improved, but he is at risk for ARF due to his underlying medical conditions and IV fluids.
5. **Immunosuppression:** The patient is on chronic immunosuppression due to his renal transplant, which puts him at risk for uncommon infections.
6. **Diabetes Mellitus:** The patient's blood sugars are labile and may require adjustments to his insulin regimen.
7. **Hypertension:** The patient's blood pressure is normotensive, but he is at risk for hypertension due to his underlying medical conditions.
8. **Cardiac Arrest:** The patient has a history of VFib arrest and is at risk for cardiac arrest due to his underlying medical conditions.
9. **Seizures:** The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for seizure recurrence due to his underlying medical conditions and medication use.
10. **Pneumothorax:** The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is at risk for pneumothorax due to the placement of the tube.

**Plan:**

* Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia
* Monitor fluid balance and adjust IV fluids as necessary
* Monitor eosinophilia and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary
* Continue immunosuppressive therapy
* Adjust insulin regimen as necessary to control blood sugars
* Monitor blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary
* Continue cardiac monitoring and adjust therapy as necessary
* Monitor seizure activity and adjust medication as necessary
* Monitor for signs of pneumothorax and adjust therapy as necessary."

   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, post-cardiac arrest anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. The stent was removed, and a tracheostomy was placed. The patient is currently tolerating tracheostomy well and has been transitioned to a trach mask.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a history of aspiration and has likely had an aspiration event, which may have led to pneumonia. He has a beta-lactam allergy, and antibiotics have been started. However, the patient may still be at risk for developing hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. **Volume Overload:** The patient has been treated with bumex overnight, and his fluid balance is being closely monitored. However, he may still be at risk for developing volume overload, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
3. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.6, which is above his baseline range. He is at risk for developing ARF, which can be further complicated by his underlying medical conditions.
4. **Immunosuppression:** The patient is on chronic immunosuppression medications, which puts him at risk for developing uncommon infections. He is also at risk for developing sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
5. **Diabetes:** The patient has labile blood sugars and is at risk for developing hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which can lead to serious complications.
6. **Hypertension:** The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but he is at risk for developing hypertension-related complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
7. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has been treated with aspirin and a statin. However, he is at risk for developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction.
8. **Dementia and Cognitive Impairment:** The patient has a history of dementia and anoxic brain injury, which may affect his cognitive function and ability to follow medical instructions.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor his fluid balance and adjust his bumex dose accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor his creatinine level and adjust his renal transplant team recommendations as needed.
4. Continue to monitor his blood sugars and adjust his insulin regimen accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor his blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensive medications as needed.
6. Continue to monitor his cardiovascular status and adjust his cardiac medications as needed.
7. Consider restarting psychotropic medications to manage the patient's dementia and cognitive impairment.
8. Continue to educate the patient and his family on his medical condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of his tracheal stent. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy and a tracheostomy was placed. The patient has been transitioned from endotracheal intubation to a tracheostomy mask, and is tolerating it well.

Current status:

* Respiratory: The patient has improved lung opacities and is tolerating the tracheostomy mask well.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a regular heart rhythm and normal S1 and S2 sounds, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated but moving all extremities.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.6 to baseline.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and he is not showing signs of sepsis.
* Infection: The patient has pneumonia, likely caused by aspiration, and is being treated with antibiotics.
* Metabolic: The patient has labile blood sugars and is being treated with insulin and sliding scale.
* Immunosuppression: The patient is on chronic immunosuppression, which puts him at risk of uncommon infections.

Potential medical complications:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a risk of developing a secondary infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppression and chronic medical conditions put him at risk of developing sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to his underlying medical conditions.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and hypertension put him at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's history of anoxic brain injury and dementia put him at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.

Assessment and plan:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall, 68.6 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is a question of lingular opacity on CXR, concern for aspiration, and is being screened for placement at a facility in [**Location (un) 109**].

The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including the placement of a Doppler tube, tube feeds started, bumex 1mg given at 10pm, and a check of the tacro level in the morning. The patient is also receiving various medications, including vancomycin, cefipime, famotidine, and haloperidol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 165/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring is stable, with a cardiac index of 2.1 L/min and a stroke volume index of 33 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 63 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 145 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, and chloride level of 103 mEq/L. The patient's glucose level is 243 mg/dL, and their lactic acid level is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a lingular opacity on CXR, which is a concern for aspiration. The patient's abdominal imaging shows a normal liver and spleen.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending placement at a facility in [**Location (un) 109**].

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's lingular opacity on CXR is a concern for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's prolonged use of the ventilator increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged use of corticosteroids and other medications can increase the risk of stress ulcer.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged use of tube feeds and lack of oral intake can lead to malnutrition.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's use of insulin and other medications can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's use of insulin and other medications can increase the risk of hyperglycemia.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's use of medications and fluids can increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
9. Infection: The patient's prolonged use of central venous catheters and other medical devices increases the risk of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   - Consider repeat VBG this morning
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider
   lengthening course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   - Consider repeat VBG this morning
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider
   lengthening course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. He underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal and placement of a tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure with aspiration pneumonia, which is likely secondary to an aspiration event
* Brief runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that have been self-limited
* Troponin leak, which is suspected to be due to demand ischemia
* Pneumonia with sputum culture showing yeast and Gram-positive cocci in pairs
* Convulsions and diaphoresis, which have improved with anxiolytic medication
* Volume overload, which is being managed with bumex
* Stent displacement, which has been removed, but may need to be replaced in the future
* Eosinophilia, which is being monitored
* Acute renal failure, which has improved with treatment
* Immunosuppression due to chronic kidney disease and chronic immunosuppressive therapy
* Diabetes, which is being managed with insulin and oral agents
* Hypertension, which is being managed with medication
* Coronary artery disease, which is being managed with aspirin and statin therapy

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia or other infections
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to coronary artery disease
* Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or other causes
* Renal failure due to inadequate treatment or underlying kidney disease
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to aspiration pneumonia or other causes
* Infection or sepsis due to immunosuppression
* Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock, due to coronary artery disease
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to anoxic brain injury or other causes"

   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider
   lengthening course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. Sputum gram stain shows yeast and Gram-positive cocci in pairs.
* Cardiovascular: Brief runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) possibly secondary to hypoxia. Troponin leak is suspected to be due to demand ischemia.
* Neurological: Sedated, but moving all extremities. Dementia and anoxic brain injury are noted.
* Renal: Acute renal failure (ARF) initially, but currently at baseline.
* Infectious: Pneumonia likely due to aspiration, with sputum culture pending. Immunosuppression due to chronic immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplant.
* Metabolic: Labile blood sugars, high in the setting of antibiotics and steroids. DM is noted.
* Gastrointestinal: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): With the patient still on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of a central line.
4. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for more aggressive therapy.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and troponin leak increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
6. Renal complications: The patient's ARF may progress, leading to further renal impairment or failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and renal function closely, while also addressing his metabolic and gastrointestinal issues."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider
   lengthening course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker.
   - transition to PO lansoprazole
   # Access: PICC line, PIV

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM. He presented to the OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. He is currently tolerating a tracheostomy mask and has been transitioned from endotracheal intubation.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD, and his EKG is normal. However, his troponin level is elevated, and he has been experiencing brief runs of VT, which are likely secondary to hypoxia.
* Renal: The patient's Cr level has improved from 1.6 to baseline, and he is on chronic immunosuppression, which puts him at risk of uncommon infections.
* Infections: The patient has pneumonia, likely caused by aspiration, and his sputum gram stain shows yeast and GPC in pairs. He is receiving vancomycin and cefepime, and his antibiotics will be continued for 10 more days.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and dementia, and he is currently sedated with fentanyl and versed.
* Endocrine: The patient has DM and is labile with blood sugars, which are currently elevated despite increased insulin and ISS.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of aspiration and is receiving tube feeds and IVF.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia could worsen and lead to respiratory failure or sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin level and brief runs of VT could indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction.
* Renal complications: The patient's chronic immunosuppression and potential sepsis could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
* Infection control: The patient's immunosuppression and chronic infections could lead to further infections, such as sepsis or opportunistic infections.
* Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and potential anoxic brain injury could lead to further neurological decline or seizures.
* Endocrine complications: The patient's labile blood sugars could lead to further hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tube feeds and IVF could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or aspiration.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Bumex for fluid management
* Morphine for pain control
* Clonazepam for anxiety control
* Ativan for agitation control
* Lantus for blood sugar control
* Enalapril and metoprolol for HTN control
* Aspirin and statin for CAD control
* Cellcept, prograf, and prednisone for immunosuppression
* Bactrim prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
* SSRI for depression

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to be transferred to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)

   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), s/p ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM). He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of his tracheal stent. The stent was removed via rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from aspiration pneumonia, which is secondary to an aspiration event. He was intubated and had a complication with stent displacement.
2. Brief Runs of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has been experiencing brief runs of VT, which are likely secondary to hypoxia. These episodes have been self-limited, and his baseline EKG has not shown any changes.
3. Troponin Leak: The patient has a troponin leak, which is likely due to demand ischemia. His CK levels have been within normal limits, suggesting that this leak occurred prior to the enzyme check yesterday.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which is likely due to an aspiration event. He has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime for 10 days, and his sputum culture has shown yeast and GPC in pairs.
5. Convulsions/Diaphoresis: The patient has been experiencing convulsions and diaphoresis, which have improved with anxiolytic medication.
6. Volume Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, which is being managed with bumex.
7. Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia, which is being monitored daily. If it persists, his antibiotics may need to be changed.
8. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.6, but has since returned to his baseline level.
9. Immunosuppression: The patient is at risk of uncommon infections due to his chronic immunosuppression.
10. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has labile blood sugars, which are being managed with insulin and a sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his pneumonia and immunosuppression.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his pneumonia is not adequately treated.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's CAD and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's anoxic brain injury and history of dementia make him at risk for neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure.
5. Infections: The patient's immunosuppression and chronic infections make him at risk for developing new infections.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of aspiration and TBM make him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's positive fluid balance and use of bumex make him at risk for electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.

In summary, the patient has a complex medical condition with multiple ongoing issues, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and immunosuppression. He is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, neurological complications, infections, gastrointestinal complications, and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent these complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheal mask and is receiving various medications, including morphine, vancomycin, and ipratropium bromide.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 59 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 150/39 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on a tracheal mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheal mask in place, with muffled heart sounds due to loud rhonchorous breathing sounds. The lungs are diffusely coarse, and the abdomen is firm with no obvious tenderness. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema with palpable pedal pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 234 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and troponin-T is 0.11 ng/mL. The patient's glucose level is 250 mg/dL, and their calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of allergies to Lasix, betalactams, and Haldol. They have received antibiotics, including cefipime, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a tracheal mask, but their lung examination reveals diffuse coarse rhonchi, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and they have received antibiotics, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation may have led to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's tracheal mask and mechanical ventilation may increase their risk of developing pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may be necessary to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema and prophylactic DVT prophylaxis may indicate a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and mechanical ventilation may increase their risk of developing neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential complications early and implement appropriate interventions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 63.6 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/39 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask, with an SpO2 of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin-T level. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 250 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's albumin level is 2.9 g/dL, and the patient's total bilirubin level is 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 250 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 250 IU/L. The patient's coagulation studies show an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T level suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's impaired renal function, as evidenced by the elevated creatinine and BUN levels, increases the risk of AKI.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L is below the normal range, which may indicate hypokalemia.
4. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level of 1.2 mg/dL is below the normal range, which may indicate hypomagnesemia.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's abnormal LFTs, including elevated AST and ALT levels, suggest the possibility of hepatic dysfunction.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and abnormal coagulation studies suggest the possibility of coagulopathy.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask and abnormal ABG results suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus bradycardia and abnormal cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **] PRN  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 ha plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider lengthening
   course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - Consider repeat head imaging
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.  AM glucose 250, but
   prior FS in 100s. Will continue to monitor.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **] PRN  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 ha plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider lengthening
   course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - Consider repeat head imaging
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.  AM glucose 250, but
   prior FS in 100s. Will continue to monitor.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement.

Current status:

* The patient is currently intubated and tolerating a tracheostomy well.
* He has a positive fluid balance, with a net fluid intake of 1 L over the past 24 hours, despite being on Bumex.
* His sputum gram stain shows yeast and GPC in pairs, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
* He has a brief history of VT, which has been self-limited.
* He has a troponin leak, which is suspected to be due to demand ischemia.
* He has a history of seizures, which have improved with anxiolytic medication.
* He has a tracheostomy in place, with no stent currently.
* He has a PICC line and PIV for access.

Potential medical complications:

* Volume overload: The patient's positive fluid balance and decreased UOP suggest that he may be at risk for volume overload.
* Pneumonia: The patient's sputum gram stain shows yeast and GPC in pairs, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
* Troponin leak: The patient's troponin leak may be due to demand ischemia, but it is unclear whether it is a sign of ongoing cardiac damage.
* Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and ongoing use of anxiolytic medication suggest that he may be at risk for further seizures.
* Immunosuppression: The patient's chronic immunosuppression puts him at risk for uncommon infections.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's corrected sodium level is high, which may be due to his fluid overload.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine level has increased, which may be due to his fluid overload and decreased UOP.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and UOP to prevent volume overload.
* Continue antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
* Monitor the patient's troponin leak and consider further cardiac evaluation if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust anxiolytic medication as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's immunosuppression and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust fluid management as necessary.
* Consider further evaluation of the patient's ARF, including consultation with the renal transplant team.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, including aspiration pneumonia, troponin leak, seizures, and immunosuppression. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - prerenal on labs
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 ha plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - continue standing clonazepam
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - repeat head CT today
   - EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, prior ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. He presents to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. The patient has been intubated and has undergone rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal and tracheostomy placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is currently on a tracheostomy with a tracheal mask, and his oxygen saturation is 98%. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and his blood pressure is 150/39 mmHg. His cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and there are no signs of cardiogenic shock or chest pain.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8. He is not opening his eyes to voice and appears comfortable/sedated.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 34 mg/dL. He is receiving bumex 1 mg IV every 12 hours for fluid overload.
* Hematological status: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 8.7 K/uL, and his platelet count is 120 K/uL. He has eosinophilia, which is being monitored.
* Endocrine status: The patient has labile blood sugars, and his blood glucose levels are being closely monitored.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a nasogastric tube (NGT) for feeding and has been receiving tube feeds. He has been experiencing diarrhea.
* Infectious status: The patient has pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. He has also been experiencing sepsis, which has been ruled out.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued respiratory support.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, but he has a history of cardiac disease and may be at risk for cardiac complications.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is critical, and he may be at risk for further neurological decline.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and he may require further renal support.
* Hematological complications: The patient has eosinophilia, which may be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation.
* Endocrine complications: The patient has labile blood sugars, and his blood glucose levels are being closely monitored.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a nasogastric tube for feeding and has been experiencing diarrhea, which may be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued respiratory support with a tracheostomy and oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask.
* Antibiotics for pneumonia.
* Bumex 1 mg IV every 12 hours for fluid overload.
* Tube feeds through an NGT.
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels and treatment of labile blood sugars.
* Monitoring of eosinophilia and treatment of underlying infections or inflammation.
* Continued cardiac and neurological monitoring and treatment as necessary.
* Renal support as necessary.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the floor pending bed availability."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue cefepime/flagyl
 trend sputum cx
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 yesterday PM (plateaued).
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider lengthening
   course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **] PRN  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.  AM glucose 250, but
   prior FS in 100s. Will continue to monitor.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, intubated, and had a complication with stent displacement. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is currently on a tracheostomy with a trach mask, tolerating well. He has a positive fluid balance, and his CXR shows increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD, and his EKG is normal. He has no signs of cardiogenic shock or chest pain.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.6, which has improved to baseline.
* Infectious: The patient has pneumonia, likely secondary to an aspiration event, with a sputum gram stain showing yeast and GPC in pairs. He has beta-lactam allergy and is being treated with cefepime for 10 days.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) and has labile blood sugars. He is being treated with lantus and a sliding scale of insulin.
* Neurological: The patient has anoxic brain injury and is sedated with fentanyl and versed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further respiratory support.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to progress, and he may require further antibiotic therapy.
* ARF: The patient's kidney function is improving, but he may require further renal support.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are elevated, and he may require further insulin therapy.
* Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia is unchanged, and he may require further monitoring and potential changes to his antibiotic therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue cefepime for 10 days
* Trend sputum CXR
* Trend UOP
* Continue bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
* Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID for anxiety and morphine for pain control
* Continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
* Continue home psych meds
* Transition to chair OOB
* Monitor I/O and daily weights
* Continue Bumex PRN with goal TBB negative 500ml
* Check PM lytes
* Continue cellcept, prograf, and prednisone
* Continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
* Continue lantus at 27 and tighten sliding scale PRN
* Continue enalapril and metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
* Continue statin
* Attempt to restart psych meds
* Continue SSRI

The patient's disposition is awaiting bed availability on the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue cefepime/flagyl
 trend sputum cx
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 yesterday PM (plateaued).
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider lengthening
   course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - Consider repeat head imaging
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **] PRN  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.  AM glucose 250, but
   prior FS in 100s. Will continue to monitor.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and hx of TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation and had a complication with stent displacement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and tolerating trach mask well. CXR shows increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate. Sputum gram stain shows yeast and GPC in pairs.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardic with a heart rate of 59 bpm. Blood pressure is 150/39 mmHg. EKG shows no changes.
* Neurological: Sedated with fentanyl and versed. Convulsions improved with anxiolytic medication, but patient has been off of Ativan for 24 hours without improvement in mental status.
* Renal: Creatinine initially elevated to 1.6, but has improved and is currently at baseline.
* Hematology: Eosinophilia noted on today's labs, but unchanged from yesterday. Troponin leak is suspected to be demand ischemia, but CK and CK-MB remain flat.
* Endocrine: Labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and after getting steroids. Glucose is currently 250 mg/dL.
* Infectious disease: Pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. Sputum culture with sensitivities is pending.
* Gastrointestinal: Tube feeds, replete electrolytes. Prophylaxis for stress ulcer, VAP, and DVT is ongoing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
* Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture with sensitivities is pending, and he may require further antibiotics or changes to his antibiotic regimen.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac instability, and he may require further cardiac monitoring and treatment.
* Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and lack of improvement in mental status may indicate ongoing neurological compromise, and he may require further neurological evaluation and treatment.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine may fluctuate, and he may require further renal monitoring and treatment.
* Infectious disease complications: The patient's eosinophilia may indicate an ongoing infection, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
* Endocrine complications: The patient's labile blood sugars may require further insulin adjustments and monitoring.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tube feeds and electrolyte repletion may require further monitoring and adjustments.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be considered:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support as needed.
* Monitor the patient's sputum culture with sensitivities and adjust antibiotics accordingly.
* Continue cardiac monitoring and treatment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and antibiotics as needed.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's infectious disease status and adjust treatment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's endocrine status and adjust insulin and electrolyte treatment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust tube feeds and electrolyte treatment as needed.
* Consider repeat head imaging to evaluate for ongoing neurological compromise.
* Consider repeat stent placement to evaluate for ongoing respiratory compromise.
* Continue immunosuppression and antirejection therapy as prescribed."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - prerenal on labs
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - d/c standing Klonopin
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin

   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and TBM. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. He was recently extubated and is now tolerating a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/52 mmHg. His respiratory status is improving, with a SpO2 of 100% and a decrease in diffuse coarse rhonchi.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.1-9.0 K/μL
* Hct: 31.3-31.6%
* Plt: 234-218 K/μL
* Cr: 1.1-1.4 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.11-0.15 ng/mL
* TCO2: 39 mmHg
* Glucose: 222-288 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 11.6/37.3/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 63/0.14/0.15

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia
* Volume overload with decreased UOP and positive fluid balance
* Troponin leak, possibly secondary to demand ischemia
* Pneumonia, likely aspiration-related, with sputum culture showing GPC in pairs and yeast
* Convulsions/diaphoresis, likely related to anxiolytic medication withdrawal
* Eosinophilia, likely related to antibiotic use
* Hypernatremia, resolved with increased free water flushes
* ARF, currently at baseline
* Immunosuppression, s/p renal transplant, with chronic immunosuppression
* DM, with labile blood sugars and high glucose levels
* HTN, with normotensive readings today
* CAD, with EKG without changes and no signs of cardiogenic shock
* Hx of CVA, with sedated but moving all extremities
* Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury, with sedated with fentanyl and versed

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis, given the patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and immunosuppression
* Pneumonia progression, given the patient's history of aspiration and immunosuppression
* Volume overload, given the patient's positive fluid balance and decreased UOP
* Cardiac complications, given the patient's history of CAD and anoxic brain injury
* Neurological complications, given the patient's history of anoxic brain injury and dementia
* Infection, given the patient's history of immunosuppression and chronic antibiotic use."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - prerenal on labs
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - continue standing clonazepam
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - prerenal on labs
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, post-cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. The patient was intubated and had a tracheostomy placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is currently on a tracheostomy with a trach mask, tolerating it well. The CXR shows increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate. The patient has been receiving PRN nebs and has had a sputum gram stain with yeast and GPC in pairs.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and his blood pressure is 99/52 mmHg. His cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and his troponin level is 0.14.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He is not opening his eyes to voice and appears comfortable/sedated. His neurologic status has not changed significantly since admission.
* Renal status: The patient has a positive fluid balance, with a net fluid balance of 3,122 mL over the past 24 hours. His creatinine level has increased to 1.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28.2 mg/dL.
* Hematological status: The patient has an eosinophilia of 3.3%, and his platelet count is 218,000/mL.
* Infectious disease status: The patient has a sputum gram stain with yeast and GPC in pairs, and his sputum culture is pending. He has been receiving antibiotics for a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further interventions to manage his respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and he may develop sepsis if he has a bacterial infection.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, but his troponin level is elevated. He may develop cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurologic status is unstable, and he may develop further neurological complications such as seizures or brain edema.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may develop acute kidney injury (AKI) if his renal function continues to decline.
* Hematological complications: The patient's eosinophilia may indicate an allergic reaction or an underlying hematological disorder. He may develop further hematological complications such as bleeding or coagulopathy.
* Infectious disease complications: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and he may develop further infectious disease complications if he has a bacterial or fungal infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide PRN nebs as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and provide cardiac medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal status and provide fluids and electrolytes as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hematological status and provide blood transfusions as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's infectious disease status and provide antibiotics as needed.
* Consider further interventions such as a bronchoscopy or a tracheostomy to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
* Consider further interventions such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) to manage the patient's cardiac complications.
* Consider further interventions such as a lumbar puncture or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to manage the patient's neurological complications.
* Consider further interventions such as a dialysis or a renal transplant to manage the patient's renal complications.
* Consider further interventions such as a platelet transfusion or a coagulation factor replacement to manage the patient's hematological complications.
* Consider further interventions such as a broad-spectrum antibiotic or an antifungal medication to manage the patient's infectious disease complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today or consider condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today.
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2182-5-14**]:
   - Renal recs: keep same tacro dosing despite slightly elevated level
   compared with goal. Check tacro level Q3d while inpatient. Hold
   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,
   before patient received decreased dose, had FS of 391 this PM. TF have
   been running at constant rate. Will monitor for now and patient will
   receive 20u tonight.
   - Hct drop with AM labs overnight to 26 -> repeat to 21. Re-check is
   29.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
 recheck UA after 7 days
   - Continue condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Check EKG
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PO lansoprazole
   # Access: PICC line, PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including CAD, s/p VFib arrest, anoxic brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration, and TBM, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent, which was removed by rigid bronchoscopy.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure, volume overload, and hypernatremia. He has also experienced brief runs of VT, which have been self-limited. His neurologic status has been impaired, with convulsions and diaphoresis, and he has been off of standing Klonopin with no further episodes.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin levels, which may represent demand ischemia
* Eosinophilia, which is being monitored
* Hypernatremia, which has resolved with increased free water flushes
* Acute renal failure, which has improved and is currently at baseline
* Elevated blood sugars, which have been better controlled with adjustments to his insulin and sliding scale prn

The patient's medications include:

* Cellcept, Prograf, and prednisone for immunosuppression
* Bactrim for prophylaxis
* Enalapril and metoprolol for HTN
* Aspirin and statin for CAD
* SSRI for dementia

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure
* Volume overload and hypernatremia
* Acute renal failure
* Eosinophilia
* Immunosuppression-related infections
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias

The patient's disposition is currently awaiting bed availability on the floor, and his code status is full code."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2182-5-14**]:
   - Renal recs: keep same tacro dosing despite slightly elevated level
   compared with goal. Check tacro level Q3d while inpatient. Hold
   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,
   before patient received decreased dose, had FS of 391 this PM. TF have
   been running at constant rate. Will monitor for now and patient will
   receive 20u tonight.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today or consider condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, prior ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis. He presents to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is intubated and tolerating a tracheostomy well. His chest X-ray shows increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate.
* Cardiovascular: He has a history of coronary artery disease and has been experiencing tachycardia, with a heart rate of 75-76 beats per minute.
* Neurological: He has a history of anoxic brain injury and dementia, and is currently sedated with fentanyl and versed.
* Renal: He has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 39 mg/dL.
* Endocrine: He has diabetes and has been experiencing labile blood sugars.
* Infections: He has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has been treated with antibiotics, which were stopped yesterday. He has a yeast and GPC in pairs in his sputum.
* Fluid status: He has a positive fluid balance, but is euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, requiring further interventions such as mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and tachycardia may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient's history of anoxic brain injury and dementia may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
* Renal complications: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
* Infections: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and current sputum culture with yeast and GPC in pairs may increase his risk of developing further infections.
* Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance may lead to fluid overload, which may require further interventions such as diuretics or fluid restriction.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy
* Antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia
* Fluid management to prevent fluid overload
* Management of blood sugars to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Monitoring of renal function to prevent further AKI
* Monitoring of cardiovascular status to prevent cardiovascular complications
* Monitoring of neurological status to prevent further neurological complications
* Consideration of repeat head CT and EEG to monitor for neurological deterioration."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2182-5-14**]:
   - Renal recs: keep same tacro dosing despite slightly elevated level
   compared with goal. Check tacro level Q3d while inpatient. Hold
   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,
   before patient received decreased dose, had FS of 391 this PM. TF have
   been running at constant rate. Will monitor for now and patient will
   receive 20u tonight.
   - Hct drop with AM labs overnight to 26 -> repeat to 21. Re-check is
   29.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today or consider condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2182-5-14**]:
   - Renal recs: keep same tacro dosing despite slightly elevated level
   compared with goal. Check tacro level Q3d while inpatient. Hold
   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,
   before patient received decreased dose, had FS of 391 this PM. TF have
   been running at constant rate. Will monitor for now and patient will
   receive 20u tonight.
   - Hct drop with AM labs overnight to 26 -> repeat to 21. Re-check is
   29.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, post-cardiac arrest anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of aspiration and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by stent displacement. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including:

1. Volume overload: The patient has had decreased urine output and is positive for fluid balance, with increased insensible losses due to diaphoresis.
2. UTI: The patient has a complicated UTI, likely caused by a catheter in place, and is being treated with ciprofloxacin.
3. Troponin leak: The patient has a troponin leak, which is likely due to demand ischemia, and is being monitored.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has likely had an aspiration event, which may have led to pneumonia, and is being treated with antibiotics.
5. Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status: The patient has had convulsions, which have improved with anxiolytic medication, and is being monitored for further episodes.
6. Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia, which is being monitored daily.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has resolved hypernatremia with increased free water flushes.
8. ARF: The patient had acute renal failure, which has improved and is currently at baseline.

   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and antihypertensive agents.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a tracheal mask.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (1.4 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (39 mEq/L). The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 31.6% to 29.1% over the past 24 hours. The patient's platelet count is 223 K/uL.

The patient's electroencephalogram (EEG) shows background activity consistent with encephalopathy, with possible bursts of delta waves representing subcortical or deep midline dysfunction.

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, with a fever of 40°C earlier in the day. The patient's lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L, and their calcium level is 9.4 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest possible kidney damage or failure.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest possible infection.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's EEG findings suggest possible encephalopathy, which can lead to seizures, coma, or even death.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 232 mg/dL, which is slightly low. Hypoglycemia can occur if the patient's glucose level drops further.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are slightly low, which can lead to muscle weakness, cramping, or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

To address these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring, including frequent laboratory tests and vital sign checks. The patient's medications should be adjusted as necessary to prevent further complications. The patient's nutrition should be optimized to prevent malnutrition and promote wound healing. The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped, completed HAP with aspiration coverge course
   - Trend UOP
   - Off diuretics for now
 consider Bumex for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
 recheck UA after 7 days
   - Continue condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]; culture showed only yeast.
   - Off abx, completed total 9 d course
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG (final read pending; prelim report consistent with
   encephalopathy)
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
    # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS;
   hypoglycemic episode to 40 a few days ago with increased Lantus. AM
   glucose 407 today.
   - Consider resume 27 U Lantus in divided doses
   - Consider [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult if patient will stay a few days longer (would
   defer to floor team)
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 Stabilized at 5-6% so no longer trending. Possibly
   secondary to Abx for PNA.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes. Na 140
   today.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating

   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped, completed HAP with aspiration coverge course
   - Trend UOP
   - Off diuretics for now
 consider Bumex for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
 recheck UA after 7 days
   - Continue condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.

   - Off abx, completed total 9 d course
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, status post ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, history of aspiration, and history of tuberculosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of his tracheal stent. The stent was removed via rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is currently on a tracheostomy mask and is tolerating it well. His oxygen saturation is 97%. His respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute, and his peak inspiratory pressure is 32 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: His heart rate is 82 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 117/46 mmHg. His cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.
* Neurological: He is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8. He has a history of anoxic brain injury and dementia.
* Renal: His creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 21-50 mg/dL. He has a history of renal transplant and is taking immunosuppressive medications.
* Infectious disease: He has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. He also has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics.
* Endocrine: He has labile blood sugars and is taking insulin and other medications to control his glucose levels.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate further, leading to increased respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's UTI could progress to sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history could lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status could deteriorate further, leading to increased sedation and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal function could deteriorate further, leading to increased risk of renal failure and the need for dialysis.
* Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and UTI could lead to further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's labile blood sugars could lead to hypoglycemia, which could have serious consequences if not treated promptly.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not treated promptly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue to monitor his respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue to treat his UTI with ciprofloxacin and monitor for signs of sepsis.
* Continue to manage his blood glucose levels with insulin and other medications.
* Continue to monitor his renal function and adjust his medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor his neurological status and adjust his sedation as needed.
* Consider restarting his psychotropic medications to improve his mental status.
* Continue to monitor his electrolyte levels and adjust his medications as needed.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped, completed HAP with aspiration coverge course
   - Trend UOP
   - Off diuretics for now
 consider Bumex for fluid overload
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  then returned to
   baseline but now with worsening renal function
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - send urine lytes
   - give 1L NS check response
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS;
   hypoglycemic episode to 40 a few days ago with increased Lantus of 27.
   Now with elevated sugars ranging from 200s to 250.
   -  Change Lantus to 25 and tighten sliding scale
   -  [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
 recheck UA after 7 days
   - Continue condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]; culture showed only yeast.
   - Off abx, completed total 9 d course
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG (final read pending; prelim report consistent with
   encephalopathy)
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped, completed HAP with aspiration coverge course
   - Trend UOP
   - Off diuretics for now
 consider Bumex for fluid overload
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  then returned to
   baseline but now with worsening renal function
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - send urine lytes
   - give 1L NS check response
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS;
   hypoglycemic episode to 40 a few days ago with increased Lantus of 27.
   Now with elevated sugars ranging from 200s to 250.
   -  Change Lantus to 25 and tighten sliding scale
   -  [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
 recheck UA after 7 days
   - Continue condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]; culture showed only yeast.
   - Off abx, completed total 9 d course
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG (final read pending; prelim report consistent with
   encephalopathy)
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
    # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 Stabilized at 5-6% so no longer trending. Possibly
   secondary to Abx for PNA.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes. Na 140
   today.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PO lansoprazole
   # Access: PICC line, PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical history. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/46 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and sedatives.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood sugars, with a range of 400s to 200s mg/dL, and anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 8.0 K/uL, and the platelet count is 273 K/uL.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% and an ABG of 32 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a tracheal mask.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are variable and may drop to 200s mg/dL, which can lead to hypoglycemic symptoms such as shakiness, confusion, and seizures.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of antibiotics may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the presence of anticoagulant medications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG levels are elevated, which may indicate respiratory failure, especially if the patient's oxygen therapy is inadequate.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rate is variable, which may indicate cardiac arrhythmias, especially if the patient's cardiac medication is not optimized.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction, especially if the patient's fluid balance is not optimized.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or liver dysfunction.
8. Infection: The patient's presence of antibiotics and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels closely and adjust the insulin infusion as needed to maintain a target range of 100-140 mg/dL.
2. Consider adding a second antibiotic to the patient's regimen to cover for potential infections.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and adjust the anticoagulant medications as needed to minimize the risk of bleeding.
4. Optimize the patient's oxygen therapy to maintain a SpO2 of 95-100%.
5. Consider adding a cardiac medication to the patient's regimen to optimize cardiac function and prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and adjust the fluid intake as needed to maintain a target range of 1-2 liters per day.
7. Consider adding a gastrointestinal medication to the patient's regimen to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's laboratory results closely for signs of infection, sepsis, or organ dysfunction."
