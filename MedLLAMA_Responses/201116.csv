   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated lactate, and
   coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.  Unclear source at
   this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how to interpret the
   elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of hepatic failure.
   No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may be cardiogenic
   given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac enzymes,
   consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is also on
   the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor

   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .
   #. New junctional bradycardia: DDX includes dig toxicity vs. acute MI
   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive at the nursing home and was brought to the ICU with hypotension, junctional bradycardia, and hypothermia.

The patient has been ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with elevated cardiac enzymes. She has also been diagnosed with coagulopathy, likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure. The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may be secondary to septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or hypovolemic shock. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is intubated for airway protection.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that could arise, including:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated lactate level and coagulopathy, sepsis is a possible diagnosis. If not treated promptly, sepsis can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's junctional bradycardia and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. If left untreated, cardiogenic shock can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
3. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's HCT drop and dry appearance on exam suggest the possibility of hypovolemic shock. If left untreated, hypovolemic shock can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is intubated for airway protection. If not treated promptly, respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's history of congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure suggests the possibility of ongoing liver damage. If left untreated, hepatic failure can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's history of ESRD suggests the possibility of ongoing renal damage. If left untreated, renal failure can lead to multi-organ failure and death.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible sepsis
2. Levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >65
3. Replacement of the right femoral line with an internal jugular (IJ) line
4. Non-invasive cuff pressures for now, with a plan to retry for an arterial line later
5. Transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for HCT drop
6. Guaiac testing of stool to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding
7. Echocardiogram on Monday to assess right ventricular function and focal wall motion abnormalities
8. Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia

The patient's ongoing care will require close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. Regular reassessment of her condition and adjustment of her treatment plan will be necessary to ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Would favor holding off on antibiotics an evaluating her status, as I
   am not sure this is sepsis.  If she decompensates, can cover broadly
   with vanc/zosyn, as she is often hospitalized, however there is no
   clear fever source at this time.
   -Follow up cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Inferior MI with ongoing hypotension and junctional rhythm, which may lead to further cardiac compromise.
	* Possible digoxin toxicity, which may worsen cardiac rhythm abnormalities.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other underlying conditions, which may require further ventilatory support.
	* Potential for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
3. Coagulation disorders:
	* Coagulopathy due to hepatic failure, which may lead to bleeding complications.
	* Possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) if not managed promptly.
4. Metabolic complications:
	* Hypoglycemia due to chronic liver disease, which may lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
	* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia, due to ongoing kidney disease and liver failure.
5. Infection-related complications:
	* Possible sepsis due to underlying chronic kidney disease and liver failure, which may lead to further organ dysfunction.
	* Potential for hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, due to prolonged hospitalization.
6. Neurological complications:
	* Possible hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to prolonged hypotension and bradycardia.
	* Potential for seizure activity due to underlying seizure disorder and hypoglycemia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulopathy and liver failure.
	* Possible gastrointestinal motility disorders due to underlying chronic kidney disease and liver failure.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and address any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Microbiology: Blood culture [**7-3**]: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   current HCT 28.9, and back to her baseline
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -active type and cross

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 72 yr old woman with ESRD, severe right sided
   heart failure and congestive hepatopathy,
   found hypotensive and bradycardic at NH, intubated and transferred with
   pressor requiring shock.

   Plan: As per housestaff notes but would add
   Hypotension: etiology still unclear whether primary cardiac event with
   hypotensive bradycardic arrest versus sepsis that led to cardiac
   compromise.
        In terms of sepsis: will Rx with Vanco, Zosyn, follow up cultures
   - add on LFTs as she had rising bili at          discharge last time
   but common bile duct stable on admit CT, send stool culture
        Regarding cardiac event: Appreciate cardiology input, continue
   medical management
        Adrenal Insuuficiency: certainly a possibility with low K and
   chronic illness - check cortisol, give   empiric stress dose steroids.
   Resp Failure: due to poor mental status. Able to switch to PSV. Will
   SBT and potential for extubation this afternoon.
   Anemia: likely due to chronic GI blood loss, responded to transfusion
   Renal: alert team - possible HD tommorow
   Access: right groin line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 72 yr old woman with ESRD, severe right sided
   heart failure and congestive hepatopathy,
   found hypotensive and bradycardic at NH, intubated and transferred with
   pressor requiring shock.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a past medical history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home with hypotension and junctional bradycardic rhythm, which was ruled in as an MI. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T)
* Coagulopathy (elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen)
* Hypoglycemia (glucose 225 mg/dL)
* Anemia (HCT 28.9)
* Elevated lactate (22 mmol/L)
* Renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.2 mg/dL)

Imaging studies reveal:

* Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis
* Possible small right pleural effusion
* Endotracheal tube extending to the carina and slightly into the right main stem bronchus

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Hypotension (BP 98/64 mmHg)
* Junctional bradycardic rhythm
* Irregularly irregular rhythm
* Dry mucous membranes
* Coarse bilateral breath sounds
* Distended abdomen with umbilical hernia
* Cool, dry, non-palpable pulses on bilateral lower extremities

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypotension and shock due to cardiac event or sepsis
* Respiratory failure due to poor mental status or underlying lung disease
* Coagulopathy and bleeding due to liver failure or anticoagulation
* Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to underlying liver disease or insulin resistance
* Anemia and bleeding due to chronic GI blood loss or underlying liver disease
* Renal dysfunction and acute kidney injury due to sepsis or underlying liver disease
* Infection and sepsis due to underlying liver disease or indwelling catheters
* Cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure due to underlying cardiac disease or electrolyte imbalances
* Adrenal insufficiency due to chronic illness or stress

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan has been implemented:

* Levophed to maintain MAP >65
* Daily full-strength aspirin
* Coverage with vancomycin and zosyn for potential infection
* Monitoring of blood glucose and lactate levels
* Administration of D50 for hypoglycemia
* Transfusion of packed red blood cells for anemia
* Consultation with cardiology and nephrology services
* Monitoring for potential complications and adjusting plan as needed."

   Microbiology: Blood culture [**7-3**]: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and
   afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found unresponsive today at her NH,
   with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia,
   elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   .
   #. Hypotension: In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated
   lactate, and coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.
   Unclear source at this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how
   to interpret the elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of
   hepatic failure.  No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may
   be cardiogenic given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac
   enzymes, consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is
   also on the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Elevated cardiac enzymes: In the setting of junctional
   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .
   #. New junctional bradycardia: DDX includes dig toxicity vs. acute MI
   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.
   .
   #. Anemia: baseline HCT 27-29, now 21.  In the setting of a history of
   UGIB
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -Type and cross and transfuse one  units
   -recheck HCT after transfusion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found unresponsive today at her NH,
   with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia,
   elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   .
   #. Hypotension: In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated
   lactate, and coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.
   Unclear source at this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how
   to interpret the elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of
   hepatic failure.  No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may
   be cardiogenic given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac
   enzymes, consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is
   also on the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Elevated cardiac enzymes: In the setting of junctional
   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .
   #. New junctional bradycardia: DDX includes dig toxicity vs. acute MI
   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.
   .
   #. Anemia: baseline HCT 27-29, now 21.  In the setting of a history of
   UGIB
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -Type and cross and transfuse one  units
   -recheck HCT after transfusion
   .
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -Will alert neprhology of the admission

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, who was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current medical condition is complicated by:

1. Hypotension: The patient is at risk of septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and hypovolemic shock, with unclear source of sepsis and unclear interpretation of elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of hepatic failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, with a history of respiratory failure and a recent admission ABG of 7.55/24/267, indicating over-ventilation.
3. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient has elevated troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, suggesting a possible inferior myocardial infarction (MI), with a junctional bradyarrhythmia and hypotension.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy with elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or poor synthetic function from hepatic failure.
5. New junctional bradycardia: The patient's new junctional bradycardia may be due to dig toxicity or acute MI, possibly an inferior MI.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has chronic hypoglycemia secondary to underlying hepatic failure, requiring frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring and D50 administration.
7. Anemia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 27-29, now 21, with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and requires transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
8. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently taking home keppra, which will be continued in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to the presence of coagulopathy, hypotension, and elevated lactate.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and junctional bradycardia suggest a possible cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of coagulopathy and hypotension.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's coagulopathy and history of UGIB increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
5. Infections: The patient's coagulopathy and immunosuppression increase the risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypoglycemia and coagulopathy increase the risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
7. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and coagulopathy increase the risk of developing acute kidney injury or worsening of renal function.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition, and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   current HCT 28.9, and back to her baseline
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -active type and cross
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -Will alert neprhology of the admission
   #. Seizure disorder
   -Continue home keppra

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and afib/aflutter, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and was treated with systemic anticoagulation due to coagulopathy. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection, receiving levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and being empirically covered with vancomycin and zosyn for potential infection. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoglycemia, anemia, and coagulopathy, which are likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's junctional bradycardic rhythm and hypotension raise suspicion for an inferior myocardial infarction, which could lead to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's empiric coverage with vancomycin and zosyn for potential infection increases the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia increases the risk of seizures, coma, and death.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen her underlying cardiac condition and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's underlying hepatic failure may worsen her condition and increase the risk of bleeding complications, infection, and death.
8. Cerebral edema: The patient's hypothermia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of cerebral edema and neurological complications.
9. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and underlying hepatic failure may worsen her renal function and increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
10. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen her condition and increase the risk of seizures, coma, and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was successfully extubated with no difficulties. She was given Levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65, and empirically covered with vancomycin and Zosyn for potential infection. She is being monitored for hypoglycemia, anemia, and coagulopathy, and is receiving daily hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Inferior myocardial infarction: The patient's hypotension and junctional rhythm raise suspicion for an inferior MI.
2. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying hepatic failure and immunosuppression.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT, PTT, and INR, and decreased fibrinogen, indicate a coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, and may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder may increase the risk of seizure activity while in the ICU.
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's underlying hepatic failure may worsen if not properly managed, and may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and digoxin toxicity may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias while in the ICU.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, and may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multi-organ dysfunction. They were previously intubated and ventilated, but were successfully extubated without difficulties. The patient has a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, and is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 345 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of organ dysfunction, including elevated lactate levels and elevated troponin levels. They have also had a blood culture drawn, which is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are still at risk for respiratory failure due to their underlying lung disease and the use of vasopressors.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving vasopressors, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a blood culture pending, and there is a risk of sepsis due to the presence of bacteria in their blood.
4. Renal failure: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which can indicate kidney dysfunction.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which can indicate liver dysfunction.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT and PTT, which can indicate a coagulopathy.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
8. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to their immobility and the presence of central venous catheters.
9. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to their immobility and the presence of a nasogastric tube.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications and to provide timely interventions to prevent or treat them."

   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure, was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was later extubated with no difficulties. She was started on hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6 and norepinephrine infusion 0.24 mcg/Kg/min.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to her underlying hepatic failure and may be exacerbated by her coagulopathy. The patient is at risk for further hypotension and may require ongoing treatment with vasopressors.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to her hepatic failure and may increase her risk of bleeding. The patient may require treatment with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.
3. Rhythm abnormalities: The patient's initial presenting rhythm was junctional bradycardia, which may be secondary to digoxin toxicity or MI. The patient is at risk for further rhythm abnormalities and may require ongoing monitoring and treatment with antiarrhythmic medications.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia is likely secondary to her underlying hepatic failure and may require ongoing treatment with glucose infusions.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to her underlying ESRD and may require ongoing treatment with blood transfusions.
6. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing dialysis treatment, which may be affected by her current medical condition.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may be exacerbated by her underlying medical condition and may require ongoing treatment with anticonvulsant medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further hypotension and hypoperfusion
2. Bleeding and hemorrhage secondary to coagulopathy
3. Rhythm abnormalities and cardiac arrest
4. Hypoglycemic seizures and coma
5. Anemia and bleeding secondary to ESRD
6. Infection and sepsis secondary to underlying medical conditions
7. Further deterioration of underlying medical conditions, including hepatic failure and ESRD."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.   AM
   cortisol in the thirties, so unlikely adrenal insufficiency.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation on digoxin. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient has been extubated and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including hypotension, hypothermia, coagulopathy, and anemia. She has been ruled in for a possible inferior myocardial infarction and is being treated with levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. She is also being empirically covered with vancomycin and zosyn despite low suspicion for infection, given her low reserve.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate and coagulopathy, which are likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on a drip of dextrose 50% to treat hypoglycemia.

The patient's plan includes daily full-strength aspirin, levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg, and empiric coverage with vancomycin and zosyn. She will also be followed up with cultures, including blood, C. difficile, and sputum. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she will not be escalated to higher levels of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac arrest due to hypotension and coagulopathy
* Infection due to the patient's low reserve and empiric antibiotic coverage
* Further deterioration of her hepatic function
* Development of DIC due to her coagulopathy
* Hypoglycemic seizures due to her chronic hypoglycemia
* Anemia due to her underlying chronic kidney disease
* Nephrotoxicity due to her continued use of digoxin."

   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She was admitted to the ICU with a plan to focus on comfort and minimizing painful procedures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/45 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 167 K/uL
* WBC count: 12.2
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 26 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.13
* Lactic acid: 8.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.0 mg/dL

The patient has a history of chronic hypoglycemia secondary to underlying hepatic failure and is currently receiving D10 drip and q2H fingersticks. She also has a history of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 21 on admission, and has received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

The patient's coagulopathy is worsening, with an INR of 5.0, and she is not receiving anticoagulation therapy at this time. Her rhythm abnormalities include an initial presenting rhythm of junctional bradycardia, which may be due to digoxin toxicity or IMI. She has received digibind in the emergency department and is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: Although the patient does not have a clear source of infection, she is at risk for sepsis due to her immunocompromised state and underlying medical conditions.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's mild troponin leak suggests that it is unlikely to represent a new event leading to cardiogenic shock, but her bradycardia and hypotension may still be causing reduced cerebral perfusion.
3. Fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's worsening INR and coagulopathy suggest that she may be experiencing fulminant hepatic failure.
4. Hypoglycemic seizures: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia and history of seizures make her at risk for hypoglycemic seizures.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her ongoing bleeding and lack of transfusions.
6. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's underlying medical conditions and laboratory results suggest that she may be at risk for electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home with new-onset junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: No clear source of infection to suggest sepsis, and troponin leak is mild, unlikely to represent a new event leading to cardiogenic shock.
2. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
3. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm was junctional bradycardia, with a differential diagnosis of digoxin toxicity vs. IMI. Digibind was given in the ED, and the patient is being monitored on telemetry.
4. Hypoglycemia: Chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure, with a plan for q2H fingersticks and D10 drip.
5. Anemia: PMH GAVE, with a HCT of 21 on admission, and the patient received one unit of PRBCs with a bump, returning to her baseline. Transfusions are being held off.
6. ESRD: The patient is on HD MWF, but is currently too unstable for HD, and there is no significant uremia or electrolyte abnormality.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient is being continued on home keppra.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Despite low suspicion for infection, the patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's troponin leak is mild, but the risk of cardiogenic shock is still present.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening coagulopathy and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and coagulopathy increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. GI bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and hypotension increase the risk of GI bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and worsening coagulopathy increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Seizures: The patient's seizure disorder and hypoglycemia increase the risk of seizures.

The patient's goals of care are focused on comfort and minimizing painful procedures, with no new lines, no escalation of care, and a DNR/DNI status."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complex medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 90/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance of 1,810 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient has a history of allergy to aspirin, Aleve, codeine, and Depakote. They have received multiple antibiotics, including cefipime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and piperacillin. The patient is also receiving various ICU medications, including famotidine, and other medications for pain and sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level, indicating possible sepsis and cardiac damage. The patient's coagulation studies show elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio, indicating possible coagulopathy. The patient's liver function tests show elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, indicating possible liver dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies show a positive blood culture from the femoral line, indicating possible sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level suggest possible sepsis and septic shock.
2. Cardiac damage: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and cardiac enzymes suggest possible cardiac damage.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio suggest possible coagulopathy.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels suggest possible liver dysfunction.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest possible renal dysfunction.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest possible respiratory failure.
7. Neurological dysfunction: The patient's altered mental status and decreased responsiveness suggest possible neurological dysfunction.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition has been deemed terminal, and a decision has been made to initiate comfort measures, including no escalation of care, DNR/DNI, and pain control with PRN IV Dilaudid at low doses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: Despite the discontinuation of vasopressors, the patient's blood pressure remains low, which may lead to further compromise of vital organs.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is still relatively slow, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrest or worsening cardiac function.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is still relatively low, which may increase the risk of further decline in cardiovascular function and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
5. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's altered mental status may be a result of hypoxia, hypotension, or sepsis, and may worsen if not addressed promptly.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder may increase the risk of seizure activity, particularly if not adequately controlled with medication.
7. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may increase the risk of further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis, particularly if not managed appropriately.
8. Hepatic failure: The patient's hepatic failure may increase the risk of further complications, such as encephalopathy, bleeding, and coagulopathy, particularly if not managed appropriately.

Given the patient's terminal condition and the decision to initiate comfort measures, it is essential to focus on providing supportive care to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a complex medical history, including ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive in her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 68/36 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is worsening, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
2. Rhythm abnormalities: The patient presented with junctional bradycardia, which may be related to digoxin toxicity or IMI.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has chronic hypoglycemia secondary to underlying hepatic failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and has received one unit of packed red blood cells.
5. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week, but is too unstable for dialysis at this time.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient is taking keppra for seizure control.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Goals of care: Comfort and minimizing painful procedures, with a focus on pain control and avoiding new lines.
2. Hypotension: The patient will be treated with levophed, but will not be restarted once weaned.
3. AMS: The patient will be treated for possible hypoglycemic seizures, with frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring and D10 drip administration.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient will not receive anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy.
5. Rhythm abnormalities: The patient will be monitored on telemetry and will have digoxin and amiodarone discontinued.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient will continue to receive D10 drip and frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring.
7. Anemia: The patient will not receive further transfusions at this time.
8. ESRD: The patient will continue on hemodialysis three times a week, but will not receive dialysis at this time.
9. Seizure disorder: The patient will continue to receive keppra for seizure control.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's troponin leak is mild, but may still indicate a new event leading to cardiogenic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient has no clear source of infection at this time, but may still be at risk for sepsis.
3. Fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's worsening INR suggests fulminant hepatic failure, which may lead to further complications.
4. Hypoglycemic seizures: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia may lead to further seizures if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may lead to further complications if not properly managed."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, who has been receiving pressors, antibiotics, and other medications. The pressors were stopped, and the antibiotics were discontinued. The patient is receiving morphine as needed for pain management. Family members have been present throughout the day.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 68/36 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94% and a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with elevated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's critical condition, but the patient is responding to stimuli and has stable vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure if the sepsis worsens.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus rhythm may be disrupted by the sepsis, leading to cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated lactate level may indicate impaired renal function, which can lead to acute kidney injury.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Central nervous system complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to central nervous system complications, such as septic encephalopathy or meningitis.
8. Multi-organ failure: The patient's sepsis may lead to multi-organ failure, which can be life-threatening."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.3°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 68/36 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 8 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 167 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.13 ng/mL
* TCO2: 22 mmHg
* Glucose: 136 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 8.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 5.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is no clear source of infection to suggest sepsis. However, the patient's troponin leak is mild, and it is unlikely to represent a new event leading to cardiogenic shock.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is worsening, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
* Rhythm abnormalities: The patient's initial presenting rhythm was junctional bradycardia, and the differential diagnosis includes digoxin toxicity vs. IMI. The patient has been treated with digibind in the emergency department and is being monitored on telemetry.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient has chronic hypoglycemia secondary to underlying hepatic failure.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and her HCT is 21. She has received one unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump and is back to her baseline.
* ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week, but she is too unstable for dialysis at this time.
* Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is being treated with home keppra.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: Despite the lack of a clear source of infection, the patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's troponin leak is mild, but the patient's hypotension and low blood pressure suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's worsening INR and coagulopathy suggest fulminant hepatic failure, which can lead to further complications.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypoglycemia and anemia suggest the possibility of electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to further complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressure suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.

The patient's goals of care are to focus on comfort and minimizing painful procedures, with no new lines, no escalation of care, and DNR/DNI status. The patient's treatment plan includes:

* No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
* Daily full-strength aspirin
* Levophed for now, will not restart once weaned
* Right femoral line in place
* Discontinue vancomycin and Zosyn, given low suspicion for infection
* Follow-up cultures
* Treat shock as indicated above
* Monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 drip
* Continue home keppra for seizure disorder
* Hold off on transfusions
* Discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
* Monitor on telemetry"
