You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old female, is being treated in the ICU for submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and is hemodynamically stable. She has a history of endometrial cancer and is obese. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 162/98 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distension, regular heart rhythm with occasional premature beats, and bilateral leg edema. Laboratory results show anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's submassive PE is a significant risk factor for further embolic events, including massive PE, which can lead to cardiopulmonary arrest.
2. Cardiac Strain: The elevated troponin and BNP levels suggest cardiac strain, which can lead to cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, potentially leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, further exacerbating cardiac strain.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to neurological symptoms, such as seizures, and potentially worsen cardiac function.
5. Fever: The patient's low-grade fever may be a sign of underlying infection, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, potentially leading to cardiac strain, stroke, or other cardiovascular complications.
7. Venous Thromboembolism: The patient's DVT may progress to a more severe condition, such as a pulmonary embolism or a deep vein thrombosis.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, potentially leading to respiratory failure, which could worsen her overall condition.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76F with h/o endometrial CA presents with CP and found to have
   large bilateral PEs.
   .
   * Submassive PE
   No prior history of clot, but at increased risk with h/o endometrial CA
   and obesity. Hemodynamically stable, however evidence of cardiac strain
   given both tropn and BNP elevated (no recent priors), however trop now
   trending down with flat CK and MB.
   - Continue IV heparin, consider changing to lovenox if no procedure
   needed
   - Start warfarin this evening if no need for IVC filter (see below)
   - Check TTE
   - Check LENIs to eval for possible need for retrievable filter
   - Standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control, uptitrate
   if needed
   - Make Gyn/Onc aware of this event given that she may need close f/u to
   rule out recurrent CA.
   .
   * Anemia:  Hct trended down to 27 (from 31) this am, baseline appears
   to be in low 30s. No evidence of bleeding, however is on heparin.
   Previously treated with iron.
   - Cont. to follow closely
   .
   * Hypernatremia
   - Resolved
   .
   * Fever, low grade
   Probably due to large PEs
   - Follow clinically, UA without pyuria no convincing evidence of pna
   .
   * Hypertension
   Likely exacerbated by current chest pain.
   - Continue home losartan, HCTZ
   - Restart BB
   - Will hold nitrates due to concern for dropping preload
   .
   * OSA
   - Continue home CPAP

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and is being managed in the ICU. Her vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing chest discomfort, pain on the right side, which is now moving to the left, and has a slight fever. Her laboratory results show anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated troponin and BNP levels, indicating cardiac strain. She is receiving heparin and warfarin, and her pain is being managed with tylenol and breakthrough medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin and BNP levels indicate cardiac strain, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's large bilateral PEs may lead to further pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, or respiratory failure.
3. Thrombotic complications: The patient is at risk for further thrombotic complications due to her underlying cancer and obesity.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications, such as fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications, such as seizures, coma, or death if not properly managed.
6. Fever: The patient's low-grade fever may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications, such as cardiac complications, kidney damage, or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including serial troponin and BNP levels.
2. Manage the patient's pain effectively to prevent further cardiac complications.
3. Monitor the patient's pulmonary status closely, including serial chest radiographs and arterial blood gas measurements.
4. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with iron therapy and close monitoring.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely, including serial sodium and potassium levels.
6. Continue to manage the patient's fever with antipyretics and close monitoring.
7. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely, including serial blood pressure measurements, and manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications as needed."

Summary:

The patient is a 90.1 kg individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath (CP/SOB). Overnight, there were no major events. The patient has a history of allergies to Zestril and Norvasc. The patient is currently receiving Heparin Sodium infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 162/98 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly, with fewer rales in the lungs. The patient's physical examination is notable for jugular venous distension (JVD) to approximately 10 cm, regular rhythm with occasional premature beats, and bilateral extremity edema.

Lab results show:

* White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 9.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 27.0%
* Platelet (Plt) count: 225 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 125 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.7/97.9/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 73/0.05, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.1/1.8/2.7 mg/dL

The patient is diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and is receiving ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Stress Ulcer, and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's PE diagnosis increases the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the embolism is large or if the patient develops further complications such as respiratory distress syndrome.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's PE diagnosis also increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the use of systemic anticoagulation.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the use of invasive monitoring devices.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the use of systemic anticoagulation and the presence of a central venous catheter.
* Renal failure: The patient's PE diagnosis increases the risk of renal failure, particularly if the patient develops acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or other factors.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the use of invasive monitoring devices."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently being treated in the ICU for submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. She has no obvious inciting event, but her history of cancer raises concerns about cancer recurrence and underlying obesity/sleep apnea. Her current condition is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm, mild tachypnea, and a blood pressure of 161/97 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer and current symptoms raise concerns about cancer recurrence. Regular follow-up with her gynecologic oncologist is necessary to monitor for any signs of recurrence.
2. Pulmonary embolism progression: The patient's submassive PE may progress to a more severe form, potentially leading to life-threatening complications. Close monitoring of her condition and timely intervention with anticoagulation therapy are essential.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are mildly low, which may contribute to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias. Repletion of potassium levels is necessary to prevent these complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring and adjustment of her antihypertensive medications are necessary to maintain a blood pressure goal of <160 mmHg.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild tachypnea may indicate underlying respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and early intervention with oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation may be necessary if her condition deteriorates.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's submassive PE may cause right ventricular strain, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure. Close monitoring of her cardiac status and timely intervention with anticoagulation therapy are essential.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's obesity and sedentary lifestyle may increase her risk of malnutrition. Close monitoring of her nutritional status and early intervention with nutritional support may be necessary to prevent malnutrition.
8. Sleep apnea: The patient's history of sleep apnea and obesity may increase her risk of respiratory complications. Close monitoring of her sleep quality and early intervention with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may be necessary to prevent respiratory complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She was admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 161/97 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4L nasal cannula. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show mild troponin leak, elevated Pro-BNP, and normal kidney function. Imaging studies reveal submassive PE with mild right ventricular overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer and elevated Pro-BNP raise concerns about cancer recurrence.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has submassive PE and is at risk for developing DVT, which could worsen her condition.
3. Right ventricular failure: The patient's mild right ventricular overload and mild troponin leak may indicate early signs of right ventricular failure.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's mild hypokalemia may require repletion to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and her goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg.
6. Sleep apnea: The patient's obesity and history of sleep apnea may increase her risk for respiratory complications.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for VTE and requires systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent further thrombosis.
8. Pain management: The patient requires pain control with morphine, and her sedation level should be monitored to prevent respiratory depression.
9. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels should be monitored and controlled to prevent hyperglycemia.
10. Nutrition: The patient requires a regular diet and should be monitored for adequate nutrition and hydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a remote history of endometrial cancer and currently presenting with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. She is receiving ICU care and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) progression: Given the patient's submassive PE, there is a risk of DVT progression, which may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary infarction or embolism.
2. Pulmonary Infarction: The patient's submassive PE may lead to pulmonary infarction, which can cause chest pain, dyspnea, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: Despite the patient's current stable condition, there is a risk of hemodynamic instability due to the PE, which may lead to cardiac arrest or other serious complications.
4. Endometrial Cancer Recurrence: The patient's remote history of endometrial cancer raises concerns about potential recurrence, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's submassive PE may lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation and other respiratory support measures.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's PE may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
7. Infection: The patient's ICU care and potential respiratory failure may increase the risk of infection, which may require prompt recognition and treatment.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat any complications that may arise."

   TTE [**5-30**]  The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The severity of
   tricuspid regurgitation is also increased and pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension is also now present.

   of RV vol/pressure overload. I would still favor a strategy which uses

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has been receiving heparin infusion and has shown improved pain in her chest. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 142/98 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 3L nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with a normal cardiovascular examination, including a normal sinus rhythm and no signs of heart failure. Her respiratory examination is clear, and her abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. Her neurologic examination is normal, with the patient attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results show an elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and mild troponin leak, indicating cardiac strain. The TTE reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function, but with evidence of RV volume and pressure overload. The patient has a small left pleural effusion on chest X-ray.

The patient's plan of care includes continuation of heparin infusion, evaluation for lower extremity clot burden, and consideration of lytic therapy. The patient will also receive enoxaparin and coumadin bridge therapy, as well as pain control with morphine and standing acetaminophen. Anemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypertension are also being managed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism progression: The patient's submassive PE may worsen, leading to increased RV strain and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Right ventricular failure: The patient's RV strain may progress, leading to RV failure, which can result in cardiogenic shock and death.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac strain may lead to arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's pleural effusion and potential RV failure may lead to respiratory compromise, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Anemia progression: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Hypertension control: The patient's hypertension may not be adequately controlled, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Bleeding risk: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of lytic therapy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She was admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. The patient has an elevated Pro-BNP and mild troponin leak, indicating potential cardiac strain. She is being treated with heparin infusion and has a plan to start coumadin. A transthoracic echo (TTE) showed right heart strain with mild hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, consistent with right ventricular overload.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with home medications. The goal is to keep her systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 160 mmHg.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which need to be repleted.
3. OSA: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is being treated with home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
4. Pain control: The patient is receiving morphine for pain management.
5. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer raises the question of potential cancer recurrence, which needs to be evaluated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of PE: The patient's submassive PE may progress to a more severe form, leading to increased risk of respiratory and cardiac complications.
2. Cardiac strain: The patient's elevated Pro-BNP and mild troponin leak indicate potential cardiac strain, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
3. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer increases the risk of recurrence, which needs to be monitored and evaluated.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's OSA and potential respiratory compromise from PE may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac strain may lead to hemodynamic instability, which needs to be closely monitored and managed."

   obvious inciting event although she does have this history of cancer
   which raises the question of cancer recurrence and underlying
   obesity/sleep apnea.   She does have an elevated Pro-BNP and mild trop

   eval for lower ext clot burden. Not surprisingly there is some evidence
   of RV vol/pressure overload. I would still favor a strategy which uses
   only Heparin The role for lytics in this case is not clear as data

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She was admitted to the ICU with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, and evidence of right ventricular strain on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has an elevated Pro-BNP and mild troponin leak. The plan is to continue heparin therapy and evaluate for lower extremity clot burden. The patient's anemia is attributed to anemia of chronic disease, and repeat iron studies are recommended. She has a history of hypertension, and her goal systolic blood pressure is less than 160 mmHg. The patient is also at risk for obstructive sleep apnea and will continue home CPAP therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged bleeding risk due to suboptimal anticoagulation management.
2. Increased risk of thromboembolic events due to underlying cancer and obesity.
3. Hypotension or hypertension due to inadequate blood pressure control.
4. Respiratory failure or worsening of lung function due to underlying sleep apnea.
5. Cardiovascular instability or arrhythmias due to underlying right ventricular strain and pulmonary hypertension.
6. Anemia or worsening of anemia due to inadequate iron replacement therapy.
7. Infection or sepsis due to central venous catheter or other invasive lines.
8. Neurological complications due to inadequate blood pressure control or hypoxia.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration due to inadequate stress ulcer prophylaxis.
10. Worsening of pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction due to inadequate treatment of underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese and relatively sedentary female with a history of endometrial cancer (thought to be in remission) and now presents with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal vital signs, and a normal respiratory rate. The patient's neurological examination is also normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results show an elevated Pro-BNP and mild troponin leak, suggesting cardiac strain. The echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis, and there is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued heparin therapy to evaluate for lower extremity clot burden.
2. Enoxaparin and coumadin bridge therapy.
3. Touch base with gynecological oncology regarding potential recurrence of malignancy.
4. Pain control with morphine.
5. Continued home CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea.
6. Restart of metoprolol for hypertension, with a goal systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's submassive PE and mild troponin leak, there is a risk of cardiac strain and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's obesity and sleep apnea may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer and elevated Pro-BNP may indicate a potential recurrence of malignancy.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and goal systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg may indicate a risk of hypertensive crisis.
6. Pulmonary embolism progression: The patient's submassive PE may progress to a more severe form, such as massive PE, which can be life-threatening."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76F with h/o endometrial CA presents with CP and found to have
   large bilateral PEs.
   .
   * Submassive PE
   No prior history of clot, but at increased risk with h/o endometrial CA
   and obesity. Hemodynamically stable, however evidence of cardiac strain
   given both tropn and BNP elevated (no recent priors), however trop now
   trending down with flat CK and MB.
   Echo yesterday with evidence of RV HK
   - Continue IV heparin, consider changing to lovenox
   - Start warfarin this evening
   - Will hold on filter given negative LENIs
   - Standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control, uptitrate
   if needed
   - Make Gyn/Onc aware of this event given that she may need close f/u to
   rule out recurrent CA.
   - Repeat TTE as outpt 4-6 weeks
   .
   * Anemia:  Hct trended down to 27 (from 31) this am, baseline appears
   to be in low 30s. No evidence of bleeding, however is on heparin.
   Previously treated with iron.
   - Cont. to follow closely
   .
   * Fever, low grade
   Probably due to large PEs
   - Follow clinically, UA without pyuria no convincing evidence of pna
   .
   * Hypertension
   Likely exacerbated by current chest pain.
   - Continue home losartan, HCTZ
   - Restart BB
   - Will hold nitrates due to concern for dropping preload
   .
   * OSA
   - Continue home CPAP
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue home salmeterol and albuterol prn

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, who presented to the ICU with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being treated with heparin and warfarin. Her vital signs are stable, but she has evidence of cardiac strain with elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Her echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function, but moderate right ventricular dilatation with mild global free wall hypokinesis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac strain: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating cardiac strain. This may be due to the PE, and it is essential to monitor her cardiac function closely.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's echo showed moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may worsen her cardiac function and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Right ventricular dysfunction: The patient's echo showed moderate right ventricular dilatation with mild global free wall hypokinesis, which may indicate right ventricular dysfunction. This may lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Bleeding risk: The patient is on heparin, which increases her risk of bleeding. It is essential to monitor her bleeding risk closely and adjust her anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be due to bleeding or other causes. It is essential to monitor her hemoglobin level closely and treat any anemia promptly.
6. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which may be due to her PE or other causes. It is essential to monitor her temperature closely and treat any underlying infections promptly.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, which may be exacerbated by her chest pain. It is essential to monitor her blood pressure closely and adjust her antihypertensive therapy accordingly.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient is on oxygen therapy, which may increase her risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia. It is essential to monitor her respiratory status closely and adjust her oxygen therapy accordingly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and adjust her anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk closely and adjust her anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level closely and treat any anemia promptly.
4. Monitor the patient's temperature closely and treat any underlying infections promptly.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust her antihypertensive therapy accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her oxygen therapy accordingly.
7. Consider repeating the patient's echo in 4-6 weeks to assess her right ventricular function and pulmonary hypertension.
8. Make the patient's gynecologic oncologist aware of her PE and cardiac complications, as she may need close follow-up to rule out recurrent cancer."

   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The severity of
   tricuspid regurgitation is also increased and pulmonary artery

   large bilateral PEs.
   .
   * Submassive PE
   No prior history of clot, but at increased risk with h/o endometrial CA
   and obesity. Hemodynamically stable, however evidence of RH strain on
   TTE yesterday, in addition both tropn and BNP elevated (no recent
   priors), however trop now trending down with flat CK and MB.
   Echo yesterday with evidence of RV HK
   - Continue IV heparin, consider changing to lovenox
   - Start warfarin today
   - Will hold on filter given negative LENIs
   - Standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control, uptitrate
   if needed
   - Make Gyn/Onc aware of this event given that she may need close f/u to
   rule out recurrent CA.
   - Repeat TTE as outpt 4-6 weeks
   .
   * Anemia:  Hct trended down to 27 (from 31) yesterday, baseline appears
   to be in low 30s. No evidence of bleeding, however is on heparin.
   Previously treated with iron.  Hct better today at 30.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) with bilateral large PEs.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/98 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and she is receiving 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distension to the angle of the jaw, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds, and mild bilateral basilar rales. Her abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender with normal bowel sounds. Her extremities are warm, symmetric, and without edema or tenderness.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin level of 0.05 ng/mL, which is trending down, and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 73 pg/mL. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a sinus rhythm with no signs of acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's imaging studies, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), show mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis, and there is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing IV heparin, considering changing to lovenox, starting warfarin, and holding on a filter given the negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENIs). She will also receive standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control and will have a repeat TTE as an outpatient in 4-6 weeks.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated, and there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which can lead to further right ventricular dysfunction and decreased cardiac output.
2. Right heart failure: The patient's right ventricular hypokinesis and dilation can lead to right heart failure, which can manifest as fatigue, shortness of breath, and peripheral edema.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin level and BNP level suggest cardiac strain, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can lead to respiratory failure, which can require mechanical ventilation.
5. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fever and elevated white blood cell count can indicate a possible septic process, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and elevated troponin level can suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's submassive PE and elevated D-dimer level can increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and organ failure.
8. Recurrent cancer: The patient's history of endometrial cancer and elevated CA-125 level can suggest recurrent cancer, which can lead to metastatic disease and poor outcomes."

   The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The severity of
   tricuspid regurgitation is also increased and pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension is also now present.

Summary:

The patient is a hypertensive individual with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute pulmonary hypertension. They are currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of right ventricular hypokinesis, mild global free wall hypokinesis, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's condition is stable, with improved breathing and reduced CP. They are receiving heparin sodium infusion for systemic anticoagulation and have a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's condition is already complicated by moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Right ventricular failure: The patient's right ventricular hypokinesis and dilatation may lead to right ventricular failure, which can cause decreased cardiac output and worsened pulmonary hypertension.
3. Increased risk of thrombosis: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, which may not be sufficient to prevent thrombus formation, especially in the presence of right ventricular hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are still receiving oxygen therapy and have a DNR code status, which may indicate a risk of respiratory complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and PE, combined with their current condition, may increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's condition may be associated with increased risk of renal dysfunction, especially if they have pre-existing kidney disease or if their blood pressure is not well-controlled.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's condition may increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, especially if they have a history of gastrointestinal disease or if they are receiving medications that can cause gastrointestinal side effects."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, obesity, and hypertension, who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and is being treated with heparin and warfarin. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 172/92 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has a minimal increase in cardiac silhouette and intrathoracic fluid content on chest radiograph, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin, which increases her risk of bleeding, especially with a history of anemia.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has large bilateral PEs, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not managed promptly.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her history of endometrial cancer, obesity, and prolonged immobility.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death if not managed promptly.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can lead to cardiac failure, stroke, and death if not managed promptly.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac disease and is at risk for cardiac arrest due to her PEs and hypertension.
8. Sepsis: The patient has a low-grade fever, which can progress to sepsis if not managed promptly.
9. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of COPD and asthma, which can lead to pneumonia if not managed promptly.
10. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to her history of hypertension and anticoagulation therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely for any signs of bleeding, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest.
3. Manage the patient's hypernatremia with close monitoring of serum sodium levels and electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Continue treatment for hypertension with losartan, HCTZ, and beta-blockers.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely for any signs of respiratory failure or pneumonia.
6. Continue antipyretics and antibiotics as needed to manage the patient's fever and potential sepsis.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely for any signs of bleeding or perforation."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and was diagnosed with submassive PE. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but has evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram and mild troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) elevation.

The patient has a history of anemia, which has trended down to 27% (from 31%) and is currently on heparin. She is also experiencing low-grade fever, which is likely due to the large PEs. Her sodium levels are elevated, and she is being encouraged to drink more fluids to promote hydration. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, likely exacerbated by her current chest pain, and she is being managed with medications to control her blood pressure.

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma, and is being managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and home medications.

The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin, and is being monitored closely for bleeding. She is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pulmonary embolism-related complications, such as recurrent PE, right heart failure, or death
* Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Anemia-related complications, such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Hypernatremia-related complications, such as dehydration or seizures
* Hypertension-related complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 90.1 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath (CP/SOB). He has a history of hypertension, benign pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute PE. He has been receiving warfarin and has been uptitrated on beta-blockers.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 172/92 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. He is receiving heparin sodium infusion and has a Coumadin (warfarin) order.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.7-10.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 27.0-32.4%
* Platelet count: 291 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 109-150 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his respiratory distress and inability to assess his peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate) with short-term intubation if needed
* Disposition: ICU

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory distress
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, due to the patient's history of hypertension and PE
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy
* Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, due to the patient's respiratory distress and immunocompromised state
* Renal dysfunction or failure due to the patient's history of hypertension and PE
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient, a 76-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a history of endometrial cancer and is at increased risk for clotting due to her obesity and cancer diagnosis. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and is being treated with warfarin and heparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 172/92 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, and hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 146 mmol/L. Her troponin-T level is 0.05 ng/mL, and her BNP level is mildly elevated.

Radiology results show a minimal increase in cardiac silhouette and intrathoracic fluid content, but no overt signs of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing warfarin until the INR is therapeutic
* Changing to lovenox due to no plan for procedure
* Holding on filter given negative LENIs
* Standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control
* Making Gyn/Onc aware of this event for close follow-up
* Repeating TTE as outpatient in 4-6 weeks

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Pulmonary embolism complications, such as hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress
* Anemia worsening due to ongoing bleeding or hemolysis
* Hypernatremia exacerbating dehydration and electrolyte imbalances
* Hypertension complications, such as cardiac strain and organ damage
* OSA and asthma exacerbations due to respiratory distress
* VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology studies is necessary to identify any potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76F with h/o endometrial CA presents with CP and found to have
   large bilateral PEs.
   .
   * Submassive PE
   No prior history of clot, but at increased risk with h/o endometrial CA
   and obesity. Hemodynamically stable, however evidence of RH strain on
   TTE, in addition both tropn and BNP elevated (no recent priors),
   however trop now trending down with flat CK and MB. Echo with evidence
   of RV HK
   - Continue IV heparin, consider changing to lovenox
   - Continue warfarin until INR therapeutic x2d
   - Will hold on filter given negative LENIs
   - Standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control, uptitrate
   if needed
   - Make Gyn/Onc aware of this event given that she may need close f/u to
   rule out recurrent CA.
   - Repeat TTE as outpt 4-6 weeks
   .
   * Anemia:  Hct trended down to 27 (from 31) yesterday, baseline appears
   to be in low 30s. No evidence of bleeding, however is on heparin.
   Previously treated with iron.  Hct better today at 30.
   - Cont. to follow closely

   * Fever, low grade
   Probably due to large PEs
   - Follow clinically, UA without pyuria no convincing evidence of pna
   .
   * Hypernatremia
   - Encourage PO, follow Na. Increased insensible losses with low grade
   temps, tachypnea
   .
   * Hypertension
   Likely exacerbated by current chest pain.
   - Continue losartan, HCTZ, BB

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and is receiving treatment with IV heparin and warfarin. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but has evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram and elevated troponin and BNP levels. The patient's anemia has trended downward, and she is being closely followed. She has also been experiencing low-grade fever, hypernatremia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient is receiving ICU care and is being managed with a PO diet, blood sugar control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism progression: The patient's submassive PE may worsen, leading to further right heart strain, hypotension, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving heparin and warfarin, which may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly given her anemia and low platelet count.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's elevated troponin and BNP levels suggest potential cardiac strain, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypernatremia and low-grade fever may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Infection risk: The patient's low-grade fever and hypernatremia may increase her risk of infection, particularly given her anemia and immunosuppressed state.
6. Hypertension complications: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. OSA exacerbation: The patient's OSA may worsen, leading to further respiratory complications, such as hypoxemia or hypercapnia."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo obese and relatively sedentary female with hx of endometrial CA
   ([**2133**]) thought to be in remission and now with submassive PE without
   hemodynamic compromise and evidence of RV strain on TTE.
    > PE: submassive by appearance without hemodynamic compromise. No
   obvious inciting event although she does have this history of cancer
   which raises the question of cancer recurrence and underlying
   obesity/sleep apnea.   She does have an elevated Pro-BNP and mild trop
   leak. For now the most reasonable strategy would be to cont Hep gtt and
   eval for lower ext clot burden. Not surprisingly there is some evidence
   of RV vol/pressure overload. I would still favor a strategy which uses
   only Heparin The role for lytics in this case is not clear as data
   indicate quicker resolution of underlying RV dysfunction with the use
   of lytics but no overall change to mortality (plus the increased risl
   of bleeding with lytics).
   - Enoxaparin and coumadin bridge today: 5 mg coumadin
   - LENI (-), no role for filter.
   - touch base with gyn-onc re: ? recurrence of malignancy
   - pain control with morphine and standing Tylenol.
    > Anemia: ? anemia of chronic disease with stably low Hct (30).
   - repeat Fe studies
   > OSA: cont home CPAP
    > HTN: cont home metop, with hx of clean cath in [**2133**] (also with trop
   leak at that time). Goal SBP < 160 mmHg
   > Arrythmia: check 12 lead ECG, could be PAC
s vs AFib
   - check electrolyes

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer thought to be in remission. She was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has an elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and mild troponin leak. The plan is to continue heparin and evaluate for lower extremity clot burden. The patient has anemia, hypertension, and arrhythmia, and will need further evaluation and management for these conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin and coumadin, which increases the risk of bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and further drops may lead to hypotension, which can worsen her condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's troponin leak and RV strain on TTE may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AFib).
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling central lines and urinary catheter.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases her risk of developing a DVT.
7. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer raises the question of cancer recurrence, which would require further evaluation and management.

These potential complications will need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent adverse outcomes and optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) with evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 172/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2.5L nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), clear lung fields, and soft and non-tender abdomen. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with the patient oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 291 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Pro-BNP: 1,111 pg/mL
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's medication list includes:

* Coumadin (warfarin) 5 mg
* Enoxaparin
* Metoprolol 25 mg tid
* Losartan
* HCTZ
* Morphine
* Tylenol
* Advair
* Nebulizer treatments

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of cancer and obesity
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's obesity and potential sleep apnea
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's history of hypertension and potential electrolyte imbalances
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and potential stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Infection due to the patient's presence in the ICU and potential catheter-related complications
* Cancer recurrence or progression due to the patient's history of endometrial cancer.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued heparin therapy
* Evaluation for lower extremity clot burden
* Pain control with morphine and standing Tylenol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission, who has developed submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on echocardiogram (TTE). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 172/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2.5L NC oxygen delivery device. The patient's physical examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure, clear breath sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and mild troponin leak, indicating cardiac strain. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2, indicating a risk of bleeding.

The patient is being treated with enoxaparin and coumadin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and her blood pressure is being controlled with metoprolol and losartan. The patient's pain is being managed with morphine and standing acetaminophen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism progression: The patient's submassive PE may progress to a more severe form, leading to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.

2. Right ventricular failure: The patient's RV strain may worsen, leading to RV failure, which can result in cardiac arrest, shock, or death.

3. Bleeding complications: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile and use of anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding into the lung.

4. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of endometrial cancer raises the possibility of recurrence, which could lead to further complications and poor outcomes.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements and elevated respiratory rate may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by the patient's obesity and sleep apnea.

6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, stroke, or death.

7. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections.

8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.

9. Renal failure: The patient's use of diuretics and anticoagulants may increase the risk of renal failure, which could be exacerbated by the patient's underlying kidney disease.

10. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac strain and arrhythmias may lead to cardiac arrest, which could be life-threatening.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."
