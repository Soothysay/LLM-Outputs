   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   .
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4.
   - If increases, renal aware and can place urgent HD line
   - Trend K overnight, if continues to increase will continue medical
   management
   - Follow-up renal recs
 will place tunnel IR in RIJ and plan for HD
   this PM
   - Trend lactate
 downtrending 1.3 from 8.1 peak
   - Check ionized calcium
 1.13
   .
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   -I/O, HD when able.
   -consider HD if needed.
   .
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-hypertensives bleed.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.
   -Consider epo as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   -Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   .
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  If not being extubated in am, then will start
   tube feeds and consult nutrition.
   # PPx: Holding hep SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT proph.
   PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access in AM. Given report
   by ED of difficulty in threading RIJ and lack of compressibility of
   RIJ/[**Last Name (LF) 3871**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] re-eval with ultrasound to assess for thrombus. Can also
   consider dedicated U/S or CT with contrast.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient Condition:**

* The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis (MWF HD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
* She was admitted from a nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes.
* She suffered an arterial bleed from the left upper extremity (LUE) fistula, which led to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
* She was resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol and received 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC), 2 units of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Shock/PEA Arrest:** The patient's hypovolemic shock and PEA arrest are likely related to the acute blood loss from the LUE AVF bleed. She may require further hemodynamic support and close monitoring.
2. **LUE AVF Bleed:** The patient's LUE AVF bleed is currently stable, but there is a high likelihood that she will require surgical revision. She may need to undergo an urgent operation to address the bleeding and potentially salvage the graft.
3. **Hyperkalemia/ESRD:** The patient's hyperkalemia is a concern, particularly given her ESRD and history of CHF. She may require further medical management and close monitoring of her potassium levels.
4. **Fever:** The patient's fever is likely related to the old AV fistula site or possibly the IJ stent. She may require further workup to determine the source of the fever and potential infection.
5. **CHF:** The patient's CHF is a concern, particularly given her recent fluid overload and ECG changes. She may require further medical management and close monitoring of her cardiac status.
6. **Dementia:** The patient's dementia is a concern, particularly given her baseline poor mental status and history of vascular dementia. She may require further psychological evaluation and management.
7. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is a concern, particularly given her ESRD and recent acute bleed. She may require further blood transfusions and close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels.
8. **CVA:** The patient's CVA is a concern, particularly given her history of CHF and ESRD. She may require further neurological evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions, including shock, PEA arrest, LUE AVF bleed, hyperkalemia, fever, CHF, dementia, anemia, and CVA."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Episodes of apnea: Improving. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Changed vent to [**11-14**] this AM.
   Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Repeat ABG this PM to assess metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean vent as tolerated to [**6-14**] and consider spontaneous breathing
   trial in PM
   - Limit sedation; consider propofol, haldol prn
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   .
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   .
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   .
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.
   -Consider epo as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   -Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   .
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding hep SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT proph.
   PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Episodes of apnea: Improving. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Changed vent to [**11-14**] this AM.
   Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Repeat ABG this PM to assess metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean vent as tolerated to [**6-14**] and consider spontaneous breathing
   trial in PM
   - Limit sedation; consider propofol, haldol prn
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   .
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   .
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   .
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted from her nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia.
* She has undergone an arterial-venous fistula (AVF) hemorrhage and PEA arrest, which was managed with a cut-down procedure and suturing of the artery and vein.
* She is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter, and receiving vasopressors.
* Her laboratory results show hyperkalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated troponin-T levels.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Shock/PEA Arrest:** The patient's hypovolemic shock and PEA arrest may lead to further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
2. **LUE AVF Bleed:** The patient's ongoing bleeding from the LUE AVF may require further intervention, including surgical revision, and may lead to hemorrhagic shock, anemia, and blood transfusion reactions.
3. **Hyperkalemia/ESRD:** The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, and may require further management, including temporary hemodialysis and potassium-lowering medications.
4. **Fever:** The patient's fever may be related to the old AV fistula site or IJ stent and may require further evaluation, including imaging studies and cultures.
5. **CVA:** The patient's history of CVA may increase her risk of further cerebrovascular events, including hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke.
6. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may worsen with ongoing bleeding and may require further management, including blood transfusions and erythropoietin therapy.
7. **Hypothyroidism:** The patient's hypothyroidism may require further management, including thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
8. **DVT:** The patient's risk of DVT may increase with her immobility and may require further prophylaxis, including anticoagulant therapy and compression stockings.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and cardiac rhythm.
* Manage the patient's shock and PEA arrest with vasopressors and fluids as needed.
* Monitor the patient's bleeding and anemia, and consider further intervention, including surgical revision and blood transfusions.
* Manage the patient's hyperkalemia with temporary hemodialysis and potassium-lowering medications.
* Evaluate the patient's fever and consider further imaging studies and cultures.
* Monitor the patient's CVA and anemia, and consider further management, including blood transfusions and erythropoietin therapy.
* Manage the patient's hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
* Consider DVT prophylaxis with anticoagulant therapy and compression stockings."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral triple lumen. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   -
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial in PM
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.
   -Consider epo as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   -Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding hep SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT proph.
   PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia. She developed an aneurysmal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) that ruptured, leading to exsanguination and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated with massive transfusion and now has an ACE bandage on the prior graft site. She has been started on vancomycin for suspected graft infection and is being monitored for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently being treated for a suspected graft infection. She is at risk for developing sepsis again, especially if the infection is not adequately treated.
2. AVF Bleed: The patient's AVF is still bleeding, and she may require further surgical intervention to repair the site. She is at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
3. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient has already experienced hypovolemic shock due to the AVF bleed and may be at risk for it again if the bleeding is not controlled.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. She is at risk for developing respiratory failure if her lung function does not improve.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CHF and is at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, especially if her heart function is not adequately monitored.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident and is at risk for developing further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
7. Infection: The patient has a suspected graft infection and is at risk for developing further infections, especially if her immune system is compromised.
8. Bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, especially if her coagulation status is not adequately monitored.
9. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia and is at risk for developing it again, especially if her potassium levels are not adequately monitored.
10. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and is at risk for developing it again, especially if her hemoglobin levels are not adequately monitored."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out and removal of graft
   components
   - Continue vancomycin, likely for six weeks
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Fever: Presently afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft
   infection. Need to be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with
   fairly extensive fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done,
   but low suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need
   to be checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up cultures
   - Possible debridement and wash-out
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   - Restarted statin yesterday (simva. 40 mg)
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of DM2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, and CVA, admitted to the ICU with a PMH significant for fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia. She was found to have an aneurysmal AV fistula graft site rupture, leading to exsanguination and PEA arrest. She received massive transfusion and was resuscitated. She now has an ACE bandage on the prior graft site and is being treated for suspected graft infection with vancomycin. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hyperkalemia, ESRD, and CHF, and is being managed with HD, vasopressors, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a suspected graft infection and is being treated with vancomycin. However, the infection may not be fully controlled, and further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure, may occur.
2. Bleeding: The patient has had significant bleeding from the AV fistula graft site and may continue to bleed, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock or other complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is being managed with HD. However, the graft infection and bleeding may further compromise renal function, leading to worsening kidney failure.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has CHF and may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of CVA and may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Metabolic Complications: The patient has diabetes and may be at risk for metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out and removal of graft
   components
   - Continue vancomycin, likely for six weeks
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Fever: Presently afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft
   infection. Need to be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with
   fairly extensive fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done,
   but low suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need
   to be checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up cultures
   - Possible debridement and wash-out
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   - Restarted statin yesterday (simva. 40 mg)
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   Presented with ? sepsis [**3-14**] infected HD graft. Graft site ruptured (was
   aneurismal) on floor with exsanguination and PEA arrest. Non-sterile
   cut down and ligation at bedside. Massive transfusion with restoration
   of pulses and mentation at baseline per family. Now with ACE bandage on
   prior graft site. Question as to washout of site and HD access, while
   continue Abx started in outpatient context by ID for suspected graft
   infection.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Transplant surgery: [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, Continue antibiotics, [**Month (only) 60**]
   need operative removal of fistula remains if remains febrile or
   decompensates.
   - Health Care Proxy [**Name (NI) 420**] and ICU Consent signed. Sisters witnessed
   - HCT [**Name (NI) 11327**] (29.2 -> 30.1 -> 30.2)
   - Med Reconciliation: Started Citalopram, Memantine, Risperidone QHS,
   and Simvastatin. Amlodipine/Labetalol being held.
   - IR placed HD LIne and pulled fem line which had guide wire left in
   place after code blue last night. Unable to perform HD on line,
   floating ateplase in line overnight will retry in the AM.

   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Fever: Presently afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft
   infection. Need to be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with
   fairly extensive fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done,
   but low suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need
   to be checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up cultures
   - Possible debridement and wash-out
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   - Restarted statin yesterday (simva. 40 mg)
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis (MWF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia, and was found to have an aneurysmal and infected arteriovenous fistula (AVF) that ruptured and caused exsanguination.

The patient received a massive transfusion protocol and was resuscitated, but remains critically ill. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a goal of weaning off the ventilator as soon as possible. Her hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine and phosphorus levels are expected to improve with dialysis.

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected infected AVF, which increases the risk of sepsis. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin.
2. Bleeding: The patient has had a significant bleed from the AVF and is at risk of further bleeding.
3. Shock: The patient has had a history of shock and is at risk of developing further episodes of shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is at risk of developing further renal failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has CHF and is at risk of developing further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of CVA and is at risk of developing further neurological complications, including stroke and seizures.
7. Infection: The patient has a suspected infected AVF and is at risk of developing further infections, including bloodstream infections and pneumonia.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. The patient's medical team should continue to monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to assess her progress and adjust her treatment plan as needed.

In terms of specific medical interventions, the patient requires:

1. Continued broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infected AVF.
2. Hemodialysis to manage her hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine and phosphorus levels.
3. Mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
4. Sedation and analgesia to manage her pain and anxiety.
5. Cardiovascular support, including pressors and vasopressors, as needed.
6. Neurological support, including anticonvulsants and antiseizure medications, as needed.
7. Infection control measures, including isolation and contact precautions, to prevent the spread of infection.

Overall, the patient requires a multidisciplinary approach to care, including input from intensivists, nephrologists, cardiologists, and other specialists."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Episodes of apnea: Improving. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Changed vent to [**11-14**] this AM.
   Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Repeat ABG this PM to assess metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean vent as tolerated to [**6-14**] and consider spontaneous breathing
   trial in PM
   - Limit sedation; consider propofol, haldol prn
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Episodes of apnea: Improving. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Changed vent to [**11-14**] this AM.
   Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Repeat ABG this PM to assess metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean vent as tolerated to [**6-14**] and consider spontaneous breathing
   trial in PM
   - Limit sedation; consider propofol, haldol prn
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.
   -Consider epo as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   -Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding hep SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT proph.
   PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic heart failure (CHF), and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe metabolic alkalosis, likely due to severe hyperkalemia, and was found to have a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus (S.A.).

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a code blue, which resulted in a prolonged period of cardiac arrest and hypotension. She has also undergone a cut-down procedure to repair an arteriovenous (AV) fistula hemorrhage and has been placed on a ventilator due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.9°C, HR = 87 bpm, BP = 150/62 mmHg, RR = 11 breaths/min, SpO2 = 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on a ventilator, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 288 mL of IV fluids and has lost 35 mL of blood, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 253 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on a ventilator with a tidal volume (Vt) of 0.393 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
* Laboratory results: The patient's blood cultures are positive for S.A., and her white blood cell count (WBC) is 9.6 x 10^9/L. Her serum creatinine (Cr) is 10.6 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 27 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are as follows: potassium (K) = 4.0 mmol/L, sodium (Na) = 137 mmol/L, chloride (Cl) = 103 mmol/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3) = 27 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's positive blood culture for S.A., there is a risk of sepsis developing.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, and there is a risk of further cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and there is a risk of further imbalance.
6. Infection: The patient's AV fistula site may be infected, and there is a risk of further infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient has had a significant bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding.

Based on this information, the patient's management plan should include:

1. Sepsis treatment: The patient should be treated with antibiotics and other supportive measures to manage sepsis.
2. Respiratory support: The patient should continue to receive respiratory support with a ventilator and other measures to manage respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac management: The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further cardiac arrest.
4. Renal management: The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to manage renal failure.
5. Electrolyte management: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to manage electrolyte imbalance.
6. Infection management: The patient's AV fistula site should be closely monitored for signs of infection, and measures should be taken to prevent further infection.
7. Bleeding management: The patient's bleeding should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, and her management plan should be tailored to address these complications and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out and removal of graft
   components
   - Continue vancomycin, likely for six weeks
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Fever: Presently afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft
   infection. Need to be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with
   fairly extensive fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done,
   but low suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need
   to be checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up cultures
   - Possible debridement and wash-out
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   - Restarted statin yesterday (simva. 40 mg)
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 76F DM, ESRD, CVA admitted with PEA arrest /
   resp failure and hemorrhagic shock from AVF bleed. HD line placed,
   guidewire removed by IR. HCT stable, home meds restarted.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.0 BP 160/60 HR 80 RR 25 with sat 100 on PSV 5/50
   0.5 7.35/52/64 (?v). Frail woman, NAD on vent, follows commands. CTA B.
   RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. L arm dressing c/d/i. Chronic stasis changes. Labs
   notable for WBC 8K, HCT 29, K+ 4.8. BCX +MRSA. CXR with clear lungs.
   Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory failure with PSV, plan to
   extubate today following HD. Mental status stable post arrest, continue
   to hold all sedatives. For sepsis / septic shock [**3-14**] MRSE bactermia /
   AVF infection / aneurysm, continue vanco per HD protocol, transpant
   surgery following, monitor serial cultures, may need to go to OR for
   removal of infected graft material for source control. For ESRD, VIP HD
   line in placed but not functioning well; may need to be rewired or
   replaced in AM. Will slowly restart antihypertensives. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above. Patient is critically ill; total time: 35 min

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out and removal of graft
   components
   - Continue vancomycin, likely for six weeks
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of DM2, ESRD, CVA, and CHF, who was admitted to the ICU with PEA arrest and hemorrhagic shock from an AVF bleed. She has been diagnosed with a suspected infected graft, and has been treated with vancomycin. She has been stabilized and is now on a ventilator, with a plan to extubate today following HD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis or septic shock due to the suspected infected graft and the presence of MRSE bacteremia.
2. Graft Failure: The patient's graft may fail due to the suspected infection, which could lead to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CHF and history of CVA may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's suspected infected graft and bacteremia may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
7. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding from the AVF may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's CVA and history of dementia may lead to further neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive decline.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vancomycin therapy for the suspected infected graft.
2. Monitor the patient's graft for signs of failure and consider replacement if necessary.
3. Continue HD therapy to manage the patient's ESRD and acute kidney injury.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further interventions, such as non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy, if necessary.
5. Consider further cardiovascular interventions, such as vasopressors or inotropes, if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's infection status and consider further antibiotics or antifungals if necessary.
7. Consider further bleeding interventions, such as transfusions or surgical repair, if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further interventions, such as anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Access/HD/ESRD: Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can
   take 200 cc rate. Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Plan for placement right femoral PICC this AM
   - Plan for repeat HD session today
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given concurrent infection
   - Will likely need tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future
   for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recommendations with respect to HD access
   - Continue nephrocaps
   .
   # Graft site/LUE AVF bleed: s/p non-sterile ligation at bedside after
   spontaneous rupture and exsanguination. Unclear if patient will need to
   go to OR to have this revised or if current suturing is appropriate.
   Currently packed and wrapped tightly with ACE bandages. Probably
   unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut down may
   need to be cleaned out and re-assessed. Not bleeding.
   - Appreciate and continue to follow input from transplant about
   possible OR for debridement/wash-out and removal of graft components
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Continue vancomycin, likely prolonged course up to six weeks for
   endovascular infection
   - Obtain vancomycin trough (keep > 15 per ID recs)
   .
   # s/p extubation. Prior episodes of apnea resolved; likely [**3-14**] to
   severe metabolic alkalosis or residual sedating medication.
   - Consider repeat ABG s/p extubation
   - Continue to hold off sedating medication
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: No longer in shock. Likely secondary to rapid
   exsanguination and had recovered with transfusion. CE still negative in
   view of creatinine/renal failure. Patient s/p massive transfusion
   protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was
   deferred in view of patient
s mental status
 baseline after
   resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft infection. Need to
   be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with fairly extensive
   fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low
   suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need to be
   checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Continue to follow up cultures
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   .
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Restarted simvastatin (initially held so as not to confuse with
   elevating CKs)
   .
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.
   # Code: Full code (confirmed)
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 4003**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11263**] (c)/[**Telephone/Fax (1) 11264**] (h)
   # Dispo: ICU level of care.
    Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory failure with PSV, plan to
   extubate today following HD. Mental status stable post arrest, continue
   to hold all sedatives. For sepsis / septic shock [**3-14**] MRSE bactermia /
   AVF infection / aneurysm, continue vanco per HD protocol, transpant
   surgery following, monitor serial cultures, may need to go to OR for
   removal of infected graft material for source control. For ESRD, VIP HD
   line in placed but not functioning well; may need to be rewired or
   replaced in AM. Will slowly restart antihypertensives. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above. Patient is critically ill; total time: 35 min

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

    Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory failure with PSV, plan to
   extubate today following HD. Mental status stable post arrest, continue
   to hold all sedatives. For sepsis / septic shock [**3-14**] MRSE bactermia /
   AVF infection / aneurysm, continue vanco per HD protocol, transpant
   surgery following, monitor serial cultures, may need to go to OR for
   removal of infected graft material for source control. For ESRD, VIP HD
   line in placed but not functioning well; may need to be rewired or
   replaced in AM. Will slowly restart antihypertensives. Remainder of

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and AVF infection, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and the patient may require further respiratory support.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodialysis (HD). The patient's kidney function may deteriorate further, leading to increased fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and may be at risk for further cardiovascular instability, including hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Neurological compromise: The patient has a history of dementia and may be at risk for further neurological compromise, including seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and increased intracranial pressure.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from the AVF and may be at risk for further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and bleeding from the surgical site.
7. Wound infection: The patient has a history of wound infection and may be at risk for further wound infections, including cellulitis, abscesses, and osteomyelitis.
8. Line-related complications: The patient has multiple lines, including a dialysis catheter and peripheral IV lines, which can lead to line-related complications, such as infection, thrombosis, and bleeding.
9. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload and may be at risk for further fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Metabolic instability: The patient has a history of metabolic instability, including hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to further metabolic complications.

To mitigate these complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the healthcare team, including regular assessments of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Access/HD/ESRD: Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can
   take 200 cc rate. Will need tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in
   future for continuing HD
   - Follow up with renal regarding postponing tunneled line access until
   Monday so as to continue to monitor blood cultures
   - Plan for repeat HD session today
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given concurrent infection
   - Follow ID, renal and transplant recommendations with respect to HD
   access
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Continue daily blood culture
   .
   # Graft site/LUE AVF bleed: s/p non-sterile ligation at bedside after
   spontaneous rupture and exsanguination. Unclear if patient will need to
   go to OR to have this revised or if current suturing is appropriate.
   Currently packed and wrapped tightly with ACE bandages. Probably
   unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut down may
   need to be cleaned out and re-assessed. Not bleeding.
   - Appreciate and continue to follow input from transplant about
   possible OR for debridement/wash-out and removal of graft components
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Continue vancomycin, likely prolonged course up to six weeks for
   endovascular infection
   - Obtain vancomycin trough (keep > 15 per ID recs)
   .
   # s/p extubation. Prior episodes of apnea resolved; likely [**3-14**] to
   severe metabolic alkalosis or residual sedating medication.
   - Obtain VBG off femoral line
   - Continue to hold off sedating medication
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: No longer in shock. Likely secondary to rapid
   exsanguination and had recovered with transfusion. CE still negative in
   view of creatinine/renal failure. Patient s/p massive transfusion
   protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was
   deferred in view of patient
s mental status
 baseline after
   resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft infection. Need to
   be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with fairly extensive
   fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low
   suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need to be
   checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Continue to follow up cultures
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   .
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   - Consider start amlodipine 5mg qd if elevated BPs
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Restarted simvastatin (initially held so as not to confuse with
   elevating CKs)
   .
   # FEN: Start PO renal diet.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral VIP line, plan to tunneled line on Monday

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Access/HD/ESRD: Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can
   take 200 cc rate. Will need tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in
   future for continuing HD
   - Follow up with renal regarding postponing tunneled line access until
   Monday so as to continue to monitor blood cultures
   - Plan for repeat HD session today
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given concurrent infection
   - Follow ID, renal and transplant recommendations with respect to HD
   access
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Continue daily blood culture
   .
   # Graft site/LUE AVF bleed: s/p non-sterile ligation at bedside after
   spontaneous rupture and exsanguination. Unclear if patient will need to
   go to OR to have this revised or if current suturing is appropriate.
   Currently packed and wrapped tightly with ACE bandages. Probably
   unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut down may
   need to be cleaned out and re-assessed. Not bleeding.
   - Appreciate and continue to follow input from transplant about
   possible OR for debridement/wash-out and removal of graft components
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Continue vancomycin, likely prolonged course up to six weeks for
   endovascular infection
   - Obtain vancomycin trough (keep > 15 per ID recs)
   .
   # s/p extubation. Prior episodes of apnea resolved; likely [**3-14**] to
   severe metabolic alkalosis or residual sedating medication.
   - Obtain VBG off femoral line
   - Continue to hold off sedating medication
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: No longer in shock. Likely secondary to rapid
   exsanguination and had recovered with transfusion. CE still negative in
   view of creatinine/renal failure. Patient s/p massive transfusion
   protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was
   deferred in view of patient
s mental status
 baseline after
   resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft infection. Need to
   be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with fairly extensive
   fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low
   suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need to be
   checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Continue to follow up cultures
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   .
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   - Consider start amlodipine 5mg qd if elevated BPs
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Restarted simvastatin (initially held so as not to confuse with
   elevating CKs)
   .
   # FEN: Start PO renal diet.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral VIP line, plan to tunneled line on Monday
   # Code: Full code (confirmed)

   # Dispo: ICU level of care.
    Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory failure with PSV, plan to
   extubate today following HD. Mental status stable post arrest, continue
   to hold all sedatives. For sepsis / septic shock [**3-14**] MRSE bactermia /
   AVF infection / aneurysm, continue vanco per HD protocol, transpant
   surgery following, monitor serial cultures, may need to go to OR for
   removal of infected graft material for source control. For ESRD, VIP HD
   line in placed but not functioning well; may need to be rewired or
   replaced in AM. Will slowly restart antihypertensives. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above. Patient is critically ill; total time: 35 min

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with a 2-day history of fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. She underwent an AV fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest, and was successfully resuscitated. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been extubated.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* ESRD, with a currently non-functional femoral VIP line that needs to be replaced or rewired
* CHF, with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and diastolic CHF
* CVA, with a history of multi-infarct dementia
* HTN, with labetalol and amlodipine held due to the bleed
* Hypothyroidism, with synthroid continued
* Anemia, with a baseline Hct of 30-35 and a goal of 21 if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
* HLD, with simvastatin restarted
* FEN, with a plan to start a PO renal diet
* PPx, with heparin SC held and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* HR: 87 bpm
* BP: 168/76 mmHg
* RR: 18 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results are:

* WBC: 14.7 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 31.8%
* Plt: 265 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 9.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.39 ng/mL
* TCO2: 29 mmHg
* Glucose: 99 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.8/27.2/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 475/11/0.37, ALT/AST: 25/34, Alk Phos/T Bili: 65/0.4, Amylase/Lipase: 19/0, Differential-Neuts: 87.0%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 1.0%, Mono: 9.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Fibrinogen: 445 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.6 g/dL, LDH: 273 IU/L, Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 4.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis/septic shock due to MRSE bacteremia and AVF infection
* Endocarditis, which may seed and need to be checked at some point
* Bleeding from the graft site, which may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed
* Acute respiratory failure, which may require continued mechanical ventilation
* ESRD, which may require ongoing dialysis and management
* HTN, which may require restarting antihypertensives
* Anemia, which may require transfusions and EPO as an outpatient
* HLD, which may require ongoing management with simvastatin
* FEN, which may require ongoing management with a PO renal diet
* PPx, which may require ongoing management with heparin SC and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis."
