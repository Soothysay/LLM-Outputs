   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1. Liver failure: initial concernf for primary fulminant liver failure,
   now appears most consistent with biliary process, remote history of
   etoh hepatitis
    - liver and tox service following
    - continue NAC
    - hepatitis panel pending
    - trending LFTs
   2. Mental status changes: uremia versus hepatic encephalopathy
    - likely not HD candidate at this moment for uremia
    - frequent neuro checks
    - holding lactulose in setting of GI bleed
   3. Coagulopathy: unclear source, holding a/c, has ivc filter in place
   4. Biliary process: gallstones, pneumobilia, possible enterobiliary
   fisutla
    - surgical services following,
    - considering percutanous gallbladder drain
    - will cont vanc/zosyn
   5. Acute renal failure:  sediment consistent with ATN
    - renal service following, no acute indication for HD, continue to
   trend electrolytes
   6. Gout:
    - continue prednisone for now at 40 mg, understanding that he is at
   increased risk for infection an dpossible wound healing, will discuss
   with his PCP regarding indication for prednisone/gout
    - holding colchicine
   7. GIB: hct drop tp 20 in setting of INR 20, responded to 3 uPRBCs no
   active s/sx bleed but egd would be useful to assess possible
   varices/gastritis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, AS with mitral regurgitation, gout, and new liver failure. He presented with altered mental status and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has developed acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and biliary process with possible gallstones and pneumobilia. He also has acute respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation studies, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications:

1. Progressive liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he has a history of ethanol hepatitis, which may lead to further liver damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation. Prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory muscle weakness, and other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and he has developed acute kidney injury. Prolonged kidney failure may lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an unclear source of coagulopathy, which may lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Biliary process: The patient's biliary process is complicated by gallstones, pneumobilia, and possible enterobiliary fistula, which may lead to further complications, including sepsis and abscesses.
6. Gout: The patient's gout is not well-controlled, which may lead to further joint damage and complications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may recur and lead to further complications.
8. Infections: The patient is at risk for infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
9. Wound healing complications: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may lead to wound healing complications, including delayed healing and infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Optimize the patient's respiratory status by adjusting mechanical ventilation and providing adequate oxygenation.
3. Manage the patient's kidney function by providing adequate hydration and electrolyte replacement.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation studies and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Manage the patient's biliary process by providing adequate pain management and antibiotics.
6. Continue to manage the patient's gout by providing adequate pain management and medications.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and provide adequate treatment and prophylaxis.
8. Provide adequate infection prophylaxis and surveillance to prevent infections.
9. Monitor the patient's wound healing and provide adequate treatment and prophylaxis to prevent complications."

   62 yo M history of wegener's with baseline creatinine 1.2, PE [**11-17**],
   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1. Liver failure: initial concernf for primary fulminant liver failure,
   now appears most consistent with biliary process, remote history of
   etoh hepatitis
    - liver and tox service following
    - continue NAC
    - hepatitis panel pending
    - trending LFTs
   2. Mental status changes: uremia versus hepatic encephalopathy
    - likely not HD candidate at this moment for uremia
    - frequent neuro checks
    - holding lactulose in setting of GI bleed
   3. Coagulopathy: unclear source, holding a/c, has ivc filter in place
   4. Biliary process: gallstones, pneumobilia, possible enterobiliary
   fisutla
    - surgical services following,
    - considering percutanous gallbladder drain
    - will cont vanc/zosyn
   5. Acute renal failure:  sediment consistent with ATN
    - renal service following, no acute indication for HD, continue to
   trend electrolytes
   6. Gout:
    - continue prednisone for now at 40 mg, understanding that he is at
   increased risk for infection an dpossible wound healing, will discuss
   with his PCP regarding indication for prednisone/gout
    - holding colchicine
   7. GIB: hct drop tp 20 in setting of INR 20, responded to 3 uPRBCs no
   active s/sx bleed but egd would be useful to assess possible
   varices/gastritis
    - cont trend hct and t/f < 26 or s/sx bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1. Liver failure: initial concernf for primary fulminant liver failure,
   now appears most consistent with biliary process, remote history of
   etoh hepatitis
    - liver and tox service following
    - continue NAC
    - hepatitis panel pending
    - trending LFTs
   2. Mental status changes: uremia versus hepatic encephalopathy
    - likely not HD candidate at this moment for uremia
    - frequent neuro checks
    - holding lactulose in setting of GI bleed
   3. Coagulopathy: unclear source, holding a/c, has ivc filter in place
   4. Biliary process: gallstones, pneumobilia, possible enterobiliary
   fisutla
    - surgical services following,
    - considering percutanous gallbladder drain
    - will cont vanc/zosyn
   5. Acute renal failure:  sediment consistent with ATN
    - renal service following, no acute indication for HD, continue to
   trend electrolytes
   6. Gout:
    - continue prednisone for now at 40 mg, understanding that he is at
   increased risk for infection an dpossible wound healing, will discuss
   with his PCP regarding indication for prednisone/gout
    - holding colchicine
   7. GIB: hct drop tp 20 in setting of INR 20, responded to 3 uPRBCs no
   active s/sx bleed but egd would be useful to assess possible
   varices/gastritis

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, aortic stenosis, and gout, who presented with altered mental status and new liver failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and Alk Phos)
* Abnormal coagulation studies (PT, PTT, and INR)
* Elevated troponin-T and CK-MB
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
* Elevated calcium and phosphorus levels
* Abnormal renal function (creatinine 6.7 mg/dL, urea 275 K/uL)
* Anemia (Hct 20.4%)

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Liver failure, possibly secondary to biliary process or etoh hepatitis
* Mental status changes, possibly due to uremia or hepatic encephalopathy
* Coagulopathy, unclear source
* Biliary process, including gallstones, pneumobilia, and possible enterobiliary fisutla
* Acute renal failure, with sediment consistent with ATN
* Gout, with possible increased risk of infection and wound healing
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, with a drop in Hct to 20 and possible varices/gastritis
* Aortic stenosis, with possible need for further evaluation

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for liver failure
* Holding lactulose due to gastrointestinal bleeding
* Considering percutaneous gallbladder drain for biliary process
* Continuing vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for potential sepsis
* Trending liver function tests and electrolytes
* Holding colchicine for gout
* Continuing prednisone for gout, with possible discussion with PCP regarding indication for prednisone/gout
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting therapy as needed

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: 18-gauge, 16-gauge, and multi-lumen
* Prophylaxis: DVT prevention with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prevention with HOB elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up

   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice:  imaging c/w gallstone ileus, may have
   associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improving
   slowly . Initial concern for fulminant liver failure on presentation,
   but  less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   Bandemia when arrived, concern for biliary sepsis
   - f/up IR re: drain function
   - f/up bile culture final
 cont Zosyn / Vanc
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   -- F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue gentle  fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs 8-10
   - goal net even if possible / esp given meningioma hx
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR : Per discussion with his partner this is a new issue
   for patient.  Most likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain.
   Currently he is back in NSR.
   .
   -follow tele closely
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 changed from 5mg q4 to
   q6 dosing
   - given transaminitis will hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today, appears more awake today  and has + gag
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - f/up GI recs
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8 HCts for now , transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status:
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia given Cr 1.2 to >4 range
 also
   considered hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT
   head with 2mm hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a
   bleed, unlikely contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - f/up neurosurgery recommendations
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra & dilantin
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now w/Solumedrol
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners. Renal feels this is not ARF
   related to Wegeners now.  Possibly pre-renal evolving to ATN.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice:  imaging c/w gallstone ileus, may have
   associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improving
   slowly . Initial concern for fulminant liver failure on presentation,
   but  less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   Bandemia when arrived, concern for biliary sepsis
   - f/up IR re: drain function
   - f/up bile culture final
 cont Zosyn / Vanc
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   -- F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue gentle  fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs 8-10
   - goal net even if possible / esp given meningioma hx
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR : Per discussion with his partner this is a new issue
   for patient.  Most likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain.
   Currently he is back in NSR.
   .
   -follow tele closely
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 changed from 5mg q4 to
   q6 dosing
   - given transaminitis will hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today, appears more awake today  and has + gag
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - f/up GI recs
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8 HCts for now , transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status:
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia given Cr 1.2 to >4 range
 also
   considered hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT
   head with 2mm hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a
   bleed, unlikely contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - f/up neurosurgery recommendations
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra & dilantin
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now w/Solumedrol
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners. Renal feels this is not ARF
   related to Wegeners now.  Possibly pre-renal evolving to ATN.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's, and prior pulmonary embolism (PE) with right heart strain and bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs). He presented to the emergency department with 1-day altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy and drainage of malodorous fluid. He has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors for hypotension.

The patient's condition is complex and unstable, with multiple potential medical complications. The most pressing concerns are:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is receiving vasopressors to maintain perfusion. The cause of hypotension is multifactorial, including sepsis, relative hypovolemia, and possible adrenal insufficiency.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) and is at risk for bleeding. He is receiving vitamin K and will be closely monitored for coagulation parameters.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of melena and is at risk for further bleeding. He is receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and will be closely monitored for signs of bleeding.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is at risk for further deterioration. He is receiving sedation and will be closely monitored for changes in his mental status.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he is at risk for further deterioration. He will be closely monitored for changes in his renal function and will require careful management of his fluids and electrolytes.
6. Meningioma and history of seizures: The patient has a history of meningioma and seizures, and will require close monitoring for signs of seizure activity or bleeding.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he will require careful management to prevent further elevation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to his underlying condition and the presence of multiple drains.
2. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his coagulopathy and GIB.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and will require close monitoring for signs of seizure activity.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to his underlying condition and the presence of multiple drains.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for further gastrointestinal complications due to his GIB and the presence of multiple drains.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of aortic valve stenosis, and will require close monitoring for signs of cardiac compromise.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration and to address the multiple medical complications that can arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and pulmonary embolism with right heart strain. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) with drainage of malodorous fluid. He was found to have a large stone in the gallbladder and air in the common duct and gallbladder neck, suggesting a possible biliary-enteric fistula.

The patient's condition has improved with rapid improvement in his liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels. However, he remains at risk for various complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and he has required pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. He is at risk for sepsis, relative hypovolemia, and adrenal insufficiency.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) and is at risk for bleeding.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has had melena on admission, and he is at risk for further bleeding.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to uremia and/or hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but he remains at risk for further deterioration.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he is at risk for further electrolyte imbalance.
7. Gout: The patient has a history of gout and is at risk for further exacerbation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and coagulopathy make him at risk for sepsis.
2. Liver failure: The patient's transaminitis and jaundice suggest possible liver failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure puts him at risk for further deterioration.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and coagulopathy make him at risk for further bleeding.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism with right heart strain puts him at risk for further embolic events.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of chronic steroids and adrenal insufficiency make him at risk for further adrenal crisis.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continuing to monitor his vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Managing his hypotension with fluids and pressors as needed.
3. Continuing his antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
4. Monitoring his coagulopathy and bleeding risk.
5. Continuing his nutrition and glycemic control as prescribed.
6. Managing his hypernatremia with fluids and electrolytes as needed.
7. Monitoring his mental status and adjusting his sedation as needed.
8. Continuing his anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
9. Monitoring his renal function and adjusting his fluid management as needed.
10. Continuing his gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis as prescribed."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. He has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, pulmonary embolism, and aortic stenosis.

The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy with drainage of malodorous fluid, and his bilirubin levels have improved. However, he continues to have transaminitis and jaundice, which are concerning for possible gallstone ileus.

The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. He requires pressors to maintain his blood pressure, and his cardiac output is compromised. His renal function is improving, but he still has acute on chronic renal failure, and his urine output is variable.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with intubation for airway protection. He is being weaned off the ventilator, but his respiratory status remains unstable.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with altered mental status and a possible diagnosis of uremic encephalopathy. He is being closely monitored for signs of seizure activity.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, including elevated bilirubin and transaminases. His coagulopathy is improving, but he still requires anticoagulation.

The patient's medical history is significant for Wegener's granulomatosis, pulmonary embolism, and aortic stenosis. He is currently on steroids for his Wegener's granulomatosis, and he has an IVC filter in place.

Based on the patient's current condition, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is improving, but he still has acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is concerning, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, and there is a risk of further infection.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is improving, but there is a risk of further bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The potential medical complications that can arise are significant, and it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

   possible fistulous connection seen on coronals, 300b:22, 23, though
   this is
   not definitively demonstrated.
   4. diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel up to nearly 4
   cm,
   with relative collapse of the TI and distal ileum. some fluid is seen
   in the
   colon. this suggest early or partial SBO. no definite transition point
   identified.
   5. IVC filter in adequate position.
   4.16 CT head repeat (prelim)

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili trending
   down.
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures, if cultures negative x48h consider discontinuing
   antibiotics
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, metoprolol effect
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   - continue home seizure ppx therapy by IV dosing
   - no evidence of worsening CNS process on CT head
   # Gout: Was on prednisone for gout. Also unclear if patient taking more
   tylenol/pain medications for gout which was component of altered mental
   status. On low dose prednisone at home
   - hold on any pain medications overnight
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts consistent with flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs s/p IVC filter [**12-18**] on coumadin. No evidence of hypoxia.
   - IV vitamin K to reverse INR
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and mild aortic valve stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy and drainage of malodorous fluid. The patient's condition has been complex and challenging, with multiple medical issues and potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and relative hypovolemia may be related to sepsis, particularly in the setting of biliary sepsis and possible biliary-enteric fistula.
2. Fulminant Liver Failure: Although the patient's liver function tests are trending down, there is still a risk of fulminant liver failure, especially given the presence of cirrhosis and potential biliary-enteric fistula.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to acute kidney failure, particularly if there is continued hypovolemia and sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding make him at risk for further bleeding, particularly in the setting of possible biliary-enteric fistula.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of aortic valve stenosis and possible sepsis make him at risk for cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible hepatic encephalopathy make him at risk for further neurological deterioration, including seizures and coma.
8. Infection: The patient's presence of a central venous catheter and possible biliary-enteric fistula make him at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection and other infections.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, and new onset acute fulminant liver failure
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Highest concern for hepatic encephalopathy with labs showing hepatic
   failure, asterixis. Also could have component of uremia with acute on
   chronic renal failure.  Also has known seizure disorder with meningioma
   which has been stable - no evidence of seizure. No recent depression,
   known high risk factors for overdosing on medications.
   CT head with 2mm hyperdensity
 not clearly a bleed, reviewed with
   neurosurg
 unlikely contributory to current presentation
   - elective intubation for airway protection overnight
   - Q2h neuro checks
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - will discuss to renal ?HD
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient on coumadin anticoagulation for outpatient.
   Unclear why would have acute coagulopathy (medication interaction, poor
   PO, dehydration, biliary process). INR>20.2 in ED.
   Good response to FFP overnight, vitK
   - hold warfarin
   - type screen x 2
   - IV PPI
   - watch closely for bleeding as at high risk, trend Hct Q6hr, transfuse
   to keep Hct>25
   .
   # Liver failure:
   Suspect [**3-13**] biliary process
   Patient in advanced fulminant liver failure with exam findings,
   INR>20.2 on admission. Unclear history - no active liver disease but
   upon further review of records, did have mention of alcoholic hepatitis
   in past and US did show mild cirrhosis of liver. Reasons for acute
   decompensation or fulminant liver failure include tylenol ingestion,
   ETOH (although no history to suggest), hepatitis (but no recent
   food/travel exposures to suggest this). No evidence of septic
   physiology, recent infection. Also checking other etiologies of liver
   failure including autoimmune hepatitis. Got NAC overnight.
   - Consider percutaneous biliary drain placement by IR, will discuss
   with surgery
   - Continue vanc/zosyn x48h, if negative consider dc. Will stop
   micafungin today.
   - Ok to continue NAC, will discuss with liver
   - FSBG Q4h, synthetic function
   - Transplant recs appreciated
   - f/u serologic panel for liver transplant eval (hepatitis panel,
   autoimmune panel, other infectious diseases)
   - f/u add on serum and urine tox including ETOH level
   - SW consult
   .
   # Melena, GIB
   - continue to trend Hcts, trend hct>25 or active bleeding
   - favor EGD, will discuss with liver
   - continue PPI
   # Hepatobiliary CT findings: Found with pneumobilia, gallstones,
   dilated small bowel with transition point raising concern for
   hepatobiliary infectious process
   See discussion above
   .
   # Renal failure: Baseline Cr was 1.3 per records. Acute renal failure
   could be in setting of liver disease, urine lytes most consistent with
   ATN, but could be component of prerenal.
   - Renal following
   - f/u UCx, Ulytes
   - No indication for HD overnight but will follow if needed tomorrow AM
   - close followup of lytes
   .
   # Gout: Was on prednisone for gout. Also unclear if patient taking more
   tylenol/pain medications for gout which was component of altered mental
   status. On low dose prednisone at home
   - hold on any pain medications overnight
   - will continue steroids for now
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs s/p IVC filter [**12-18**] on coumadin. No evidence of hypoxia.
   - IV vitamin K to reverse INR
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   - continue home seizure ppx therapy by IV dosing
   - no evidence of worsening CNS process on CT head
   .
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts consistent with flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including meningioma, Wegeners, and prior pulmonary embolism. He is currently admitted to the ICU with acute fulminant liver failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy and drainage of malodorous fluid, and was started on metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He also received IV fluids for hypotension and was transfused with one unit of blood.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver failure, with an INR greater than 20.2, and acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a positive troponin T level.

The patient's medical history includes a prior pulmonary embolism with a right heart strain, and he is currently on coumadin anticoagulation. He also has a history of Wegeners, and his current symptoms may be related to a flare of this condition.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and pantoprazole. He is also receiving IV vitamin K to reverse his INR, and is being treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for liver failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Continued progression of liver failure, leading to worsening coagulopathy, bleeding, and encephalopathy.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to acute lung injury from liver failure or sepsis.
3. Worsening of acute renal failure, leading to oliguria or anuria, and requiring dialysis.
4. Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, or retroperitoneal bleeding.
5. Infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection, which can exacerbate liver failure and acute kidney injury.
6. Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock, due to liver failure or sepsis.
7. Neurological complications, including worsening encephalopathy, seizures, or cerebral edema, due to liver failure or sepsis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction, due to liver failure or sepsis.
9. Pulmonary complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pneumothorax, due to sepsis or liver failure.
10. Infection-related complications, including bacteremia, sepsis, or organ failure, due to liver failure or sepsis.

In light of these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU, with frequent assessments of his liver and renal function, coagulation status, and respiratory and cardiovascular status."

   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice:  imaging c/w gallstone ileus, may have
   associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improving
   slowly . Initial concern for fulminant liver failure on presentation,
   but  less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   Bandemia when arrived, concern for biliary sepsis
   - f/up IR re: drain function
   - f/up bile culture final
 cont Zosyn / Vanc
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   -- F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue gentle  fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs 8-10
   - goal net even if possible / esp given meningioma hx
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR : Per discussion with his partner this is a new issue
   for patient.  Most likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain.
   Currently he is back in NSR.
   .
   -follow tele closely
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 changed from 5mg q4 to
   q6 dosing
   - given transaminitis will hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today, appears more awake today  and has + gag
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - f/up GI recs
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8 HCts for now , transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status:
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia given Cr 1.2 to >4 range
 also
   considered hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT
   head with 2mm hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a
   bleed, unlikely contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - f/up neurosurgery recommendations
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra & dilantin
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now w/Solumedrol
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice:  imaging c/w gallstone ileus, may have
   associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improving
   slowly . Initial concern for fulminant liver failure on presentation,
   but  less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   Bandemia when arrived, concern for biliary sepsis
   - f/up IR re: drain function
   - f/up bile culture final
 cont Zosyn / Vanc
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   -- F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue gentle  fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs 8-10
   - goal net even if possible / esp given meningioma hx
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR : Per discussion with his partner this is a new issue
   for patient.  Most likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain.
   Currently he is back in NSR.
   .
   -follow tele closely
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 changed from 5mg q4 to
   q6 dosing
   - given transaminitis will hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today, appears more awake today  and has + gag
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - f/up GI recs
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8 HCts for now , transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status:
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia given Cr 1.2 to >4 range
 also
   considered hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT
   head with 2mm hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a
   bleed, unlikely contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - f/up neurosurgery recommendations
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra & dilantin
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now w/Solumedrol
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners. Renal feels this is not ARF
   related to Wegeners now.  Possibly pre-renal evolving to ATN.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and pulmonary embolism with right heart strain. He is currently intubated in the ICU for airway protection and is being treated for a variety of complications.

The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) with drainage of malodorous fluid, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are slowly improving. He has a biliary drain in place, and the output has trailed off since its placement. The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, and he has a large stone in his gallbladder with air in the common duct and gallbladder neck, which may be concerning for a biliary-enteric fistula.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. He has a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to his underlying medical conditions and medications. The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he is being treated with pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg.

The patient has a history of seizures and is being treated with anticonvulsants. He has a meningioma and is at risk for bleeding, which may be exacerbated by his coagulopathy. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

The patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, which may be contributing to his renal failure. He has a history of pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, which may be affecting his cardiac function. The patient's aortic valve stenosis may also be contributing to his cardiac issues.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Biliary-enteric fistula: The patient's large stone in his gallbladder with air in the common duct and gallbladder neck may lead to a biliary-enteric fistula, which can cause sepsis, abscesses, and further complications.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's history of acute on chronic renal failure, as well as his use of nephrotoxic medications, increases his risk of developing AKI.
3. Sepsis: The patient's biliary drain and potential biliary-enteric fistula may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and death.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of meningioma make him at risk for bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, as well as his aortic valve stenosis, may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of melena and his use of anticoagulation medications increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to central nervous system symptoms, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, if left untreated.
8. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and paralysis if left untreated.

In summary, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including biliary-enteric fistula, acute kidney injury, sepsis, bleeding, cardiac complications, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia. Close monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today

   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and prior pulmonary embolism (PE) with right heart strain and bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) with drainage of malodorous fluid. The patient's condition has improved, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and malodorous fluid drainage from the biliary drain suggest sepsis. He is receiving antibiotics, but the possibility of sepsis should be closely monitored.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, relative hypovolemia, and post-ATN diuresis. He is receiving vasopressors, and his fluid status should be closely monitored.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) and low platelet count indicate coagulopathy. He is receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma, and his INR should be closely monitored.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient had melena on admission, and he is at risk for further bleeding due to his coagulopathy and continued use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute kidney injury is likely due to sepsis and ATN. His creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving diuretics to manage his fluid status.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated bilirubin and transaminases suggest liver dysfunction, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He may require weaning from the ventilator in the near future.
8. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction, which should be monitored closely.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium level may be due to his underlying condition or the use of hypertonic fluids.
10. Gout: The patient has a history of gout and is receiving steroids, which may exacerbate his condition.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload
   ICU Care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, and prior pulmonary embolism with right heart strain and bilateral deep vein thromboses. He presented to the emergency department with 1-day altered mental status, encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology with drainage of malodorous fluid. He was found to have a large stone in the gallbladder, air in the common duct, and gallbladder neck, which is concerning for biliary-enteric fistula. He also had diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel, suggesting early or partial small bowel obstruction.

The patient's conditions include:

1. Transaminitis and jaundice: Suspect gallstone ileus with possible biliary infection.
2. Hypotension: Suspect sepsis, relative hypovolemia, and adrenal insufficiency.
3. Afib with RVR: Most likely precipitated by acute illness and pain.
4. Coagulopathy: INR improved with vitamin K, but warfarin is being held.
5. GIB: Patient had melena on admission, and EGD was held due to coagulopathy.
6. Altered mental status: Suspect uremia and/or hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Acute on chronic renal failure: Felt most likely due to ATN, with good urine output and no indication for HD at this time.
8. Meningioma and h/o seizures: Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, with no bleeding or significant acute process.
9. Hypernatremia: Check PM lytes and free water deficit, with repletion conservatively.
10. Gout: Continuing steroids for now.
11. h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, or red cell casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners.
12. h/o PE: Continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, with an IVC filter.

The patient's laboratory results include:

* WBC: 5.4-10.5
* Hct: 20.4-29.6
* Plt: 249-256
* Cr: 3.9-6.1
* TropT: 0.04
* TCO2: 24
* Glucose: 113-175
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.3/30.4/1.5; CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 812/8/0.04; ALT/AST: 339/286; Alk Phos/T Bili: 458/7.0; Amylase/Lipase: 48/59

The patient's plan includes:

1. Serial abdominal exams and follow-up of biliary drain output.
2. Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now.
3. Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain.
4. Continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for now for question of biliary sepsis, pending cultures.
5. Follow pretransplant serologic workup.
6. Wean pressors as needed, targeting CVPs >10.
7. Check lactate, central venous O2, and repeat TTE.
8. Hold on amiodarone due to transaminitis.
9. Continue pain control.
10. No anticoagulation for now, given bleeding and coagulopathy.
11. Repeat TTE and wean to PSV today.
12. Trend INR and maintain active T+S.
13. Continue PPI drip and follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25.
14. Favor EGD when stabilized.
15. Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks.
16. Follow lytes and urine output closely.
17. Continue keppra and run close to even.
18. Watch for fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's biliary-enteric fistula and possible biliary infection.
2. GIB: Given the patient's history of melena and coagulopathy.
3. ATN: Given the patient's acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's liver disease and altered mental status.
5. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of pulmonary embolism and DVTs.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: Given the patient's history of steroids and adrenal insufficiency.
7. Gout: Given the patient's history of gout and ongoing steroids.
8. Wegeners: Given the patient's history of Wegeners and ongoing steroids.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition:

* The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy with drainage of malodorous fluid, which may be related to a cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
* The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR) and was started on metoprolol.
* A head CT scan revealed a 2mm left frontal hyperintensity, which is likely an incidental finding.
* The patient has hypotension in the setting of osmotic diuresis, which was treated with IV fluids and vasopressor support.
* The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, and they have received a transfusion of one unit of blood.
* The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, sedatives, and analgesics.
* The patient has a respiratory support with mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 500mL, respiratory rate of 16, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* The patient has a diagnosis of acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, fulminant hepatic failure, altered mental status, and coagulopathy.
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and lactate levels, as well as a low platelet count.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of a drain and the patient's immunocompromised state.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's underlying liver disease and coagulopathy.
* Respiratory failure or worsening hypoxia due to the patient's underlying lung disease and mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's underlying cardiac disease and electrolyte imbalances.
* Hepatic encephalopathy or worsening altered mental status due to the patient's underlying liver disease.
* Renal failure or worsening acute kidney injury due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and hypovolemia.
* Coagulopathy or bleeding complications due to the patient's underlying liver disease and platelet dysfunction.

Given the patient's complex condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications and adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, AS, gout, and presented with altered mental status and new liver failure. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient has a biliary obstruction and sepsis, which has been managed with a percutaneous drain insertion. The patient is still on empiric antibiotics, and follow-up cultures from the drain are pending. The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), which has been treated with phenylephrine. The patient's renal function is improving, but the patient still has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is at risk for further complications.

The patient has a coagulopathy, which is being managed with anticoagulation. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with minimal secretions and a need for mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of gout, which is being managed with chronic prednisone and currently with solumedrol for absorption issues. The patient also has a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Biliary sepsis and liver failure: The patient's biliary obstruction and sepsis can lead to further liver failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute tubular necrosis (ATN) can lead to further kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to further respiratory complications, including pneumonia and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) can lead to life-threatening complications, including hemorrhagic shock.
7. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can lead to further systemic complications, including organ failure and potentially life-threatening complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, AS with a left ventricular assist device, gout, and previously presented with altered mental status and new liver failure. He is currently in the ICU with a biliary obstruction and sepsis, renal failure, coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Medical Complications:

1. Biliary obstruction/Sepsis: The patient has a percutaneous drain in place, and follow-up cultures are pending. Empiric antibiotics are being continued, and the plan is to tailor antibiotic therapy once final cultures are available.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has sedimentation in the urine consistent with acute tubular necrosis in the setting of sepsis. Urea and creatinine levels are improving, and the plan is to continue monitoring urine output and electrolytes during post-ATN diuresis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient is anticoagulated for a history of pulmonary embolism and has responded well to vitamin K. If no new bleeding occurs, coumadin therapy will be restarted soon.
4. AF with RVR: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, and rate control will be managed with low-dose beta blockers or amiodarone if persistent problems occur.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, with minimal secretions. A pressure support ventilation trial is planned.
6. Gout: The patient is on chronic prednisone for gout, but the exact indication is unclear. He is currently receiving solumedrol for absorption issues.
7. GIB: There are no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding since the initial presentation, and the plan is to check hemoglobin and hematocrit levels every 8 hours. If rebleeding occurs, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be necessary.

ICU Care:

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - grew out GNRs in [**2-12**] blood cultures/anaerobic sample
   - no real changes to liver team plan, LFTs and INR improving
   - continued on Zosyn/Vanco ; held off on double GN coverage for now
   - TTE today --> EF 80% hyperdynamic, mild LVH, unable to assess pulm
   HTN or not , no vegetations
   - neurosurg wants to keep even for I/Os
   - no new [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs , just f/up final biliary cxs, drain ok amount per
   surgery
   - renal felt should watch diuresis amounts and keep up with IVFs as he
   will be auto-diuresing large amounts / osmotic diuresis, following
   lytes closely q8 hrs ( Ca, K, Mg, Phos, Na )- feel combination of
   tubular injury and hypotension, Cr improving slowly
   - Afib was refractory to metoprolol, digoxin so placed on amiodarone
   load with bolus
   - given Afib most of night, felt not very stable for OG tube placement
   & given that plan was possible SBT in morning seemed unnecessary to do

   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and prior pulmonary embolism (PE) with right heart strain and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, jaundice, and transaminitis, and was found to have acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Intubated for airway protection, on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 500 mL, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 127 mmHg, and a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m2.
* Renal function: Creatinine level of 4.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 226 mg/dL, and a urine output of 740 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Liver function: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 261 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 144 IU/L, and total bilirubin level of 5.5 mg/dL.
* Coagulation profile: International normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 27.8 seconds, and a platelet count of 14,800 cells/mm3.
* Electrolyte imbalance: Hypokalemia (potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L), hypocalcemia (calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL), and hypomagnesemia (magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL).
* Infectious diseases: Positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and a suspected biliary infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and suspected biliary infection increase the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and jaundice suggest potential liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremic encephalopathy.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and aPTT suggest a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and hypoxemia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest potential cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and encephalopathy.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of melena and coagulopathy increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities and complications. The note highlights the following key points:

1. Positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs) with no changes to the liver team plan, LFTs, and INR improving.
2. The patient is on Zosyn/Vanco and held off on double GN coverage for now.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is present, which was refractory to metoprolol and digoxin, and amiodarone was loaded with a bolus.
4. The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 4.9 mg/dL, and the renal team is monitoring diuresis amounts and IVF closely.
5. The patient has a history of angioedema and is allergic to Lisinopril.
6. The patient has a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 81-81% and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.
7. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) with a cardiac output of 4.5 L/min.
8. The patient has a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL and a platelet count of 274.
9. The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3.
10. The patient has a lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L and an albumin level of 2.5 g/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the presence of GNRs in the blood cultures.
2. Atrial fibrillation with a risk of embolism and stroke.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute renal failure (ARF) due to the presence of ARF and the patient's history of angioedema.
4. Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory rate and mixed venous oxygen saturation.
5. Coagulopathy due to the prolonged PT and PTT.
6. Hypoglycemia due to the patient's history of liver failure and the presence of ARF.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's history of liver failure.
8. Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of DVT prophylaxis.

Based on the patient's condition and the potential medical complications, the ICU care plan should focus on managing the patient's sepsis and septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and acute kidney injury. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the patient should be managed with a multidisciplinary approach to prevent and treat potential complications."

   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

   Code status:
   Disposition:  ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, and prior pulmonary embolism with right heart strain and bilateral deep vein thromboses. He is currently in the ICU with a range of complications.

The patient's main issues include:

1. Biliary sepsis: The patient has a suspected gallstone ileus with associated biliary infection, which has led to transaminitis and jaundice. He has undergone percutaneous cholecystotomy and is being treated with antibiotics.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, and he has required pressors to maintain adequate perfusion. The cause of his hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to sepsis, relative hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency.
3. Afib with RVR: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is likely related to his acute illness and pain. He is being treated with metoprolol and amiodarone.
4. Ventilatory support: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is being weaned to a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is likely related to his liver disease and is being treated with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had melena on admission, which is likely related to his coagulopathy. He is being treated with proton pump inhibitors and is being monitored for further bleeding.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which is likely related to uremia or hepatic encephalopathy. He is being monitored closely for further changes in his mental status.
8. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which is likely related to his liver disease and is being treated with diuretics and fluid management.
9. Meningioma and history of seizures: The patient has a history of meningioma and seizures, which are being monitored closely.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with fluid management and electrolyte repletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these issues include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's biliary sepsis and hypotension make him at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding make him at risk for further bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for further deterioration in his renal function, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines make him at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now

   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control

   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - grew out GNRs in [**2-12**] blood cultures/anaerobic sample
   - no real changes to liver team plan, LFTs and INR improving
   - continued on Zosyn/Vanco ; held off on double GN coverage for now
   - TTE today --> EF 80% hyperdynamic, mild LVH, unable to assess pulm
   HTN or not , no vegetations
   - neurosurg wants to keep even for I/Os
   - no new [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs , just f/up final biliary cxs, drain ok amount per
   surgery
   - renal felt should watch diuresis amounts and keep up with IVFs as he
   will be auto-diuresing large amounts / osmotic diuresis, following
   lytes closely q8 hrs ( Ca, K, Mg, Phos, Na )- feel combination of
   tubular injury and hypotension, Cr improving slowly
   - Afib was refractory to metoprolol, digoxin so placed on amiodarone
   load with bolus
   - given Afib most of night, felt not very stable for OG tube placement
   & given that plan was possible SBT in morning seemed unnecessary to do

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and mild aortic valve stenosis. He was admitted with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He had a percutaneous cholecystotomy and received a course of N-acetylcysteine (NAC).

Current issues:

1. Transaminitis and jaundice: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels have improved since the cholecystotomy. However, he is still at risk for fulminant liver failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive, and his blood pressure is difficult to control. He has been receiving pressors, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is being monitored.
3. Afib with RVR: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is likely related to his acute illness and pain.
4. Ventilation: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is being weaned to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) support.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) has improved with vitamin K, but he remains at risk for bleeding.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient had melena on admission, and his coagulopathy has increased his risk for bleeding.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to uremia, but hepatic encephalopathy is also a possibility.
8. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but he is still at risk for volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being monitored and managed conservatively.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest sepsis, which could be related to his biliary infection or other sources.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but he remains at risk for fulminant liver failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is at risk for respiratory failure if his ventilation is not optimized.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest cardiovascular instability, which could be related to his sepsis, hypovolemia, or other factors.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and GIB increase his risk for bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
6. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure increases his risk for volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen his condition.

Based on these findings, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels to assess for signs of liver failure.
2. Optimize the patient's ventilation and respiratory support to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Manage the patient's hypotension and tachycardia with fluid boluses and pressors as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk, and consider transfusing platelets and fresh frozen plasma if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels, and adjust his fluid management and medication regimen accordingly.
6. Consider stress-dose steroids if the patient's cortisol levels are low, but be cautious due to his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider weaning sedation to assess for signs of delirium or other neurological deficits.
8. Consider performing a stress echocardiogram to assess the patient's cardiac function and identify any potential cardiac complications."

   INR improved following vitamin K. INR
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI, held on EGD given absence of large bleeding. Hct
   has been stable overnight.
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter however if
   Hct remains stable overnight
   # Hypotension: Patient off pressors now.
   Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative hypovolemia in setting of
   post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider also afib/RVR, meds
   (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic steroids at home,
   consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
 equivalent of 40 pred of solumedrol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI, held on EGD given absence of large bleeding. Hct
   has been stable overnight.
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter however if
   Hct remains stable overnight
   # Hypotension: Patient off pressors now.
   Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative hypovolemia in setting of
   post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider also afib/RVR, meds
   (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic steroids at home,
   consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and prior pulmonary embolism (PE) with bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs).
* He was admitted to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure.
* The patient was found to have Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia and underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy for biliary infection.
* He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for potential biliary sepsis.
* The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and is being treated with amiodarone.
* He is intubated for airway protection and is being weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV).
* The patient has coagulopathy with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), which has improved following vitamin K administration.
* He has acute kidney injury (AKI) with oliguria and is being managed with fluid boluses and diuresis.
* The patient has hypernatremia, which is being managed with conservative repletion of free water deficit.
* He has a history of seizures and is being treated with levetiracetam (Keppra).
* The patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis and is being closely monitored for signs of flare.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to GNR bacteremia and potential biliary sepsis.
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock due to AFib/RVR and potential cardiac strain.
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to inadequate perfusion, sepsis, and potential nephrotoxicity from antibiotics.
* Coagulopathy and bleeding due to liver dysfunction and potential vitamin K deficiency.
* Neurological complications such as seizures, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema due to sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and potential cerebral vasculitis.
* Pulmonary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to sepsis, fluid overload, and potential pulmonary embolism.
* Gastrointestinal complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, and cholangitis due to sepsis, coagulopathy, and potential biliary obstruction.
* Infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and bloodstream infection due to sepsis and potential immunosuppression.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1.)  Biliary obstruction/Sepsis: Now s/p perc drain.  Now with GNR in
   the blood.
   -Follow up cultures from drain.
   -Continue empiric Zosyn, Vanc.   Will wait for final cultures to tailor
   abx.
   -Daily surveillance cultures
   -Now off pressors
   -Surgery on board
    2.)  Renal Failure:  Sediment c/w ATN in setting of sepsis.  U/o and
   Creatine both improving.
   -Continue to monitor u/o, lyes during post-ATN diuresis
   -TBB goal even today
    3.)  Coagulopathy: Anticoagulated for h/o PE in [**11-17**].  INR responded
   vigorously to Vitamin K.
   -If no new bleeding, will restart coumadin tomorrow.
    4.) AF with RVR:  Currently in sinus.
   -Will continue with amio load for now, as acute illness improves this
   will hopefully settle down as well.
    5.)  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated originally for airway
   protection.  Minimal secretions, tolerating SBT this AM
   -Extubate
   6. Gout: Apparently on chronic prednisone 40mg daily.  Unclear if all
   for gout or in part for WG.
   - Currently on solumedrol for absorption issues.  Once ileus
   sufficiently better, can switch back to prednisone.
    7. GIB: No signs of GIB since melena on initial presentation.
   -Check Q8hr HCT for now.  If rebleeds, may need EGD
    Rest of plan per resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, aortic stenosis, gout, and liver failure. He was admitted with altered mental status and new liver failure. He has been diagnosed with biliary obstruction/sepsis, renal failure, coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, respiratory failure, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's condition has been stable overnight, with runs of atrial fibrillation treated with digoxin and amiodarone. He has been weaned off neosynephrine and is now off pressors. His creatinine is improving, and he is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine, as well as decreased albumin and platelet count. His imaging studies show low lung volumes, and his microbiology results show growth of a gram-negative rod in his blood culture.

The patient's plan includes continued empiric antibiotic therapy, daily surveillance cultures, and follow-up cultures from his biliary drain. He will be monitored for signs of bleeding, and his anticoagulation therapy will be restarted tomorrow if no new bleeding occurs.

Potential medical complications:

1. Biliary obstruction/sepsis: The patient's biliary drain may become clogged or infected, leading to further complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine may continue to rise, requiring further management.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR may remain elevated, increasing the risk of bleeding.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen, requiring further management.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may experience further gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring endoscopy or other interventions.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate, requiring further management.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, AS with mitral valve disease, gout, and liver failure.
* He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure.
* He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with amiodarone.
* He has renal failure, with sedimentation c/w acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis.
* He has a coagulopathy, which is being managed with anticoagulation therapy.
* He has a biliary obstruction, which has been treated with a percutaneous drain.
* He has a gastrointestinal bleed, which is being monitored closely.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient has a biliary obstruction and GNR in the blood, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. **Renal Failure:** The patient's renal function is improving, but he is still at risk of developing chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. **Coagulopathy:** The patient is at risk of bleeding due to his coagulopathy, particularly if he is not adequately anticoagulated.
4. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
5. **Gastrointestinal Bleed:** The patient is at risk of rebleeding, particularly if his coagulopathy is not adequately managed.
6. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia or other respiratory complications due to his intubation and mechanical ventilation.
7. **Infection:** The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a percutaneous drain.
8. **Organ Failure:** The patient is at risk of developing organ failure, particularly in the kidneys, liver, or heart, due to his underlying medical conditions.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed to manage his atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, and other medical conditions.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
5. Consider extubating the patient once his respiratory status improves.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
7. Consider switching the patient to oral anticoagulation therapy once his coagulopathy is adequately managed.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and optimize his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-inch tall individual who was extubated 24 hours ago and is showing slow improvement in mental status. They have a history of angioedema with lisinopril and are currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 136/89 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and are being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 16.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 233 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 83 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: Na 143 mmol/L, K 4.0 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, HCO3 27.0 mmol/L

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

* Acute renal failure
* Gastrointestinal bleed
* Hepatic failure
* Coagulopathy
* Atrial fibrillation
* Altered mental status

Potential medical complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure and pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's coagulopathy and altered mental status increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to death.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic failure increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and seizures.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed increases the risk of bleeding complications, including hypovolemic shock and death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure increases the risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider administering antibiotics to prevent sepsis.
3. Consider administering anticoagulants to prevent coagulopathy.
4. Consider administering vasopressors to support blood pressure.
5. Consider administering diuretics to manage fluid overload.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as an intensive care unit (ICU), for closer monitoring and management."

   have GNR bacteremia
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus and associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili continues to
   improve
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams Q4hr, follow biliary drain output
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function daily
   - Continue fentanyl boluses as needed for abdominal pain
   - Can DC vancomycin, may change Zosyn to cipro to complete 7d course
   abx (D1=[**5-24**])
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   #Afib with RVR/sinus tachycardia
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain. Now on amiodarone as no
   response to metoprolol and digoxin. No improvement with fluids [**Month (only) 8**]
   improve after extubation
   - Continue amiodarone gtt s/p load
   - Can trial metoprolol or dilt prn
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - f/u TSH
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday

   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K. INR
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI, held on EGD given absence of large bleeding. Hct
   has been stable overnight.
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter however if
   Hct remains stable overnight
   # Hypotension: Patient off pressors now.
   Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative hypovolemia in setting of
   post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider also afib/RVR, meds
   (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic steroids at home,
   consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
 equivalent of 40 pred of solumedrol
   currently
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and pulmonary embolism with right heart strain. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He was intubated for airway protection and had a percutaneous cholecystostomy performed for biliary infection. He was treated with antibiotics, and his liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels have improved.

Current Status:

* Patient is extubated and on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 3%.
* His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 136/89 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute.
* His mental status is slowly improving, but he is still disoriented and responds to verbal commands.
* His laboratory results show improving liver function, with a decrease in his bilirubin level and an improvement in his INR.
* He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his hemoglobin level is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for sepsis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for pulmonary embolism.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's history of liver disease and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for liver failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's history of renal disease and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for atrial fibrillation.
7. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for hypotension.
8. Altered Mental Status: The patient's history of altered mental status and his current diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure make him at risk for altered mental status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's acute on chronic renal failure with diuretics and hemodialysis as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
5. Consider the patient's risk for sepsis and pulmonary embolism and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
7. Consider the patient's risk for hypotension and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's altered mental status and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and pulmonary embolism, who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure.
* The patient had a percutaneous cholecystostomy for biliary infection and was found to have GNR bacteremia.
* The patient's condition has improved, with rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K, and decreasing levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes.
* The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a FiO2 of 3% and PIP of 11 cmH2O.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 136/89 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute.
* The patient has a white blood cell count of 16.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 256.
* The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with elevated levels of ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as decreased levels of albumin and total bilirubin.
* The patient's imaging studies show right infrahilar consolidation and left atelectasis, with no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
* The patient's medical conditions include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute on chronic renal failure.
* The patient is receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, anticoagulation, and fluid resuscitation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia and possible source of infection
* Respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory distress and possible need for tracheostomy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to ongoing coagulopathy and possible need for transfusion
* Acute kidney injury due to ongoing hypovolemia and possible need for dialysis
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to ongoing liver dysfunction and possible need for liver transplantation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to ongoing atrial fibrillation and possible need for cardioversion
* Adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use and possible need for steroid replacement
* Worsening of meningioma symptoms due to ongoing infection and possible need for surgical intervention."

   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He has a history of meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and pulmonary embolism. He was previously intubated and is now extubated. His mental status is slowly improving, and he is able to answer questions and move his extremities. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 136/89 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a mild RUQ pain and is receiving treatment for suspected biliary infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is 37.1°C, and he has a history of pneumonia and biliary infection. He may be at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he has a history of liver disease. He may be at risk for developing liver failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure and is receiving treatment for it. He may be at risk for developing further renal failure.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is at risk for developing further emboli.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for developing further neurological complications.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is at risk for developing further infections.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk for developing further hypotension.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving treatment for respiratory failure and may be at risk for developing further respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL

   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU with bacteremia, biliary infection, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been slowly improving, with improvements in his mental status, blood pressure, and urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and biliary infection put him at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI is likely due to the bacteremia and biliary infection, and may require further management, including dialysis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be exacerbated by his bacteremia and biliary infection, and may require further management, including transfusions.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's GIB may be due to his coagulopathy and bacteremia, and may require further management, including endoscopy.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to his sepsis, AKI, and coagulopathy, and may require further management, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to his sepsis, AKI, and coagulopathy, and may require further management, including sedation and neuromuscular blockade.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may be due to his dehydration and may require further management, including fluid replacement and electrolyte management.
8. Gout: The patient's gout may be exacerbated by his steroid use and may require further management, including medication adjustments.

ICU Care:

The patient's ICU care should focus on managing his sepsis, AKI, coagulopathy, GIB, hypotension, altered mental status, hypernatremia, and gout. This may include:

* Antibiotics for his bacteremia and biliary infection
* Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors for his hypotension
* Dialysis for his AKI
* Transfusions for his coagulopathy
* Endoscopy for his GIB
* Sedation and neuromuscular blockade for his altered mental status
* Fluid replacement and electrolyte management for his hypernatremia
* Medication adjustments for his gout."

   CXR [**5-27**]
   Right infrahilar consolidation has been present since at least [**5-24**]. On
   the left, a less severe region of presumed atelectasis has slowly
   progressed.
   Lung volumes remain quite low. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.
   With
   the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm from the
   carina
   is still acceptable. Right jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial
   junction. No pneumothorax.
   [**5-26**] TTE
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus and associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili continues to
   improve
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - d/w IR timing of pulling drain
   - Serial abdominal exams Q4hr, follow biliary drain output
   - Discuss fistulogram with surgery, GI
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function daily
   - Continue fentanyl boluses as needed for abdominal pain
   - Can DC vancomycin, will d/c Zosyn and switch to Cipro to complete 7d
   course abx (D1=[**5-24**])
   - follow-up in liver clinic as outpatient for ?cirrhosis
   - f/up pretransplant serologic workup
   # Paroxysmal Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain. Now on amiodarone HR
   better controlled overnight, in SR this morning.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt s/p load
   - Can trial metoprolol or dilt prn if needed
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - f/u TSH result
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K.
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI, held on EGD given absence of large bleeding. Hct
   has been stable overnight.
   - holding warfarin for now
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   # Hypotension: Patient off pressors now.
   Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative hypovolemia in setting of
   post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider also afib/RVR, meds
   (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic steroids at home,
   consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   # Altered mental status
   Now significantly improved. Considerations included uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm
   hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely
   contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - start on lactulose TID
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process. No need for bolt.
   - continue keppra /dilantin --. Switch to PO today
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   .
   # Gout:
   - will continue current dose of steroids for now ; change to PO
   prednisone today
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including a meningioma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of pulmonary embolism. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He was found to have GNR bacteremia and a biliary infection, which was treated with antibiotics and percutaneous cholecystostomy. He has also been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with amiodarone.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 16.5 K/uL
* Hct: 28.5%
* Plt: 256
* Cr: 2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 83 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 287 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Right infrahilar consolidation with a less severe region of presumed atelectasis on the left.
* TTE: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a small left ventricular cavity and hyperdynamic function. There is mild aortic valve stenosis and trivial mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and biliary infection increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Liver failure: The patient's transaminitis and jaundice suggest liver dysfunction, which can progress to liver failure if not treated promptly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of coagulopathy increase the risk of further bleeding.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia requires close monitoring and management to prevent further electrolyte imbalance.
7. Meningioma progression: The patient's meningioma requires close monitoring for signs of progression, which can lead to neurological deficits and death.
8. Wegener's granulomatosis flare: The patient's history of Wegener's granulomatosis requires close monitoring for signs of flare, which can lead to renal failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function and electrolyte levels closely.
3. Manage the patient's blood pressure and cardiac rhythm carefully.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and urine output closely.
5. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk.
6. Monitor the patient's hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalance closely.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's meningioma and Wegener's granulomatosis for signs of progression or flare.
8. Consider a limited PO trial and discuss with surgery.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust as necessary.
10. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with GNR bacteremia, biliary infection, AMS, GIB, and ARF. He has been improving slowly, with his mental status improving and his vital signs stabilizing. He has been extubated and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. He has a biliary drain in place with dark, foul-smelling fluid and is receiving antibiotics and other medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and a biliary infection, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has transaminitis and jaundice, which may indicate liver dysfunction and increase his risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is at risk of developing another one, especially given his current condition.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk of bleeding again, especially given his coagulopathy.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may indicate a sodium imbalance and increase his risk of developing complications such as seizures or coma.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of taking chronic steroids and is at risk of developing adrenal insufficiency, especially given his current condition.
8. Meningioma and Seizures: The patient has a history of meningioma and seizures, which may increase his risk of developing seizures or other neurological complications.
9. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, which may increase his risk of developing complications such as kidney failure or respiratory problems.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, gout, and acute liver failure in the setting of cholecystitis. The patient was extubated successfully and is showing improvement in mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 135/89 mmHg.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently stable on amiodarone and lopressor. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, for which an IVC filter was placed.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Elevated bilirubin
* Elevated creatinine
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen
* Low albumin
* Low platelet count
* Elevated white blood cell count

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Cholecystitis: The patient will be monitored for signs of infection and will likely require surgery 2-3 weeks after the infection has improved.
* Gout: The patient will continue to take prednisone and will hold colchicine in the setting of renal failure.
* AFib RVR: The patient will continue to take amiodarone and lopressor.
* History of PE and DVT: The patient will be monitored for signs of recurrence and will likely require further anticoagulation therapy.
* Altered mental status: The patient will be monitored for signs of worsening encephalopathy and will be given lactulose to help manage symptoms.
* SZR d/o: The patient will continue to take keppra.
* Wegener's: The patient's condition is stable.
* Neck pain: The patient will be given ultram to help manage pain.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued liver failure and encephalopathy
* Worsening of renal insufficiency
* Infection related to the cholecystitis
* Recurrence of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis
* Worsening of atrial fibrillation
* Development of sepsis
* Development of multi-organ failure

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and management will be necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis and gout, who presented with acute liver failure in the setting of cholecystitis. The patient has made some improvements over the past 24 hours, including extubation and improving mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 98.4°C (36.9°C)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm
* Blood pressure: 135/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 8 mmHg

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 16.5 K/uL
* Hct: 27.4%
* Plt: 15.8 K/uL
* Cr: 2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 83 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation studies, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Cholecystitis: The patient's drain is to be pulled, and a fistulogram will be performed to rule out enterobiliary drainage. Cipro will be started, and Vanc and Zosyn will be discontinued.
* Gout: The patient will continue to receive prednisone, and colchicine will be held due to renal failure.
* AFib RVR: The patient's medication regimen will be continued, including amiodarone and lopressor, and TSH will be followed up.
* History of PE and DVT: The patient will be followed up with GI regarding possible EGD before restarting systemic anticoagulation.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving, and lactulose will be trialed.
* SZR d/o: The patient will continue to receive keppra IV for now.
* Wegener's: The patient's condition is stable.
* Neck pain: Ultram will be trialed.

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: Thin liquid diet
* Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: 18 Gauge, 16 Gauge, and Multi Lumen
* Prophylaxis: DVT, SQ UF Heparin, and stress ulcer PPI
* VAP: Comments not provided

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening liver failure and renal insufficiency
* Development of sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and anticoagulation
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
* Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppressive therapy and invasive lines

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve the patient's outcomes."
