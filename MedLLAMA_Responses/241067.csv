You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and implantation of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 65 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 112/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Somnolent but otherwise well-appearing
* Sclera anicteric
* PERRL, EOMI
* Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa
* Supple neck with no appreciable jugular venous pressure
* PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
* Distant heart sounds with normal S1 and S2
* No murmurs, gallops, or thrills
* No S3 or S4
* Unlabored respirations with no accessory muscle use
* Soft abdomen with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly
* Lower left-midline scar from a previous appendectomy
* No femoral bruits
* R femoral sheath in place
* L arm AV fistula with palpable thrill and audible bruit
* Ulceration on L anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue
* Chronic skin changes of bilateral lower extremities consistent with stasis dermatitis

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.3-7.6 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 30.1-30.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 160-205 K/μL
* Creatinine: 9.4-9.8 mg/dL
* TropT: 12.68-16.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 102-181 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history include:

* Bleeding due to the patient's history of CVA and ESRD, and the use of anticoagulation medications
* Infection due to the patient's chronic skin changes and ulceration
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's CAD and history of STEMI
* Renal complications such as acute kidney injury or worsening of ESRD due to the patient's history of ESRD and the use of nephrotoxic medications
* Nutritional deficiencies due to the patient's poor oral intake and history of malnutrition

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the plan of care includes:

* Continuing anticoagulation therapy with amiodarone and aspirin
* Monitoring the patient's clotting times and platelet count
* Evaluating the patient for dialysis and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed
* Managing the patient's pain and discomfort
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and providing oxygen therapy as needed
* Providing wound care and managing the patient's chronic skin changes
* Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjusting therapy as needed
* Evaluating the patient's nutritional status and providing nutritional support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of a Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Bare Metal Stent (BMS). He is currently in sinus rhythm with some non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His physical examination is unremarkable, except for a left leg ulcer with eschar and granulation tissue.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing cardiac damage. His white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and his platelet count is decreased. His kidney function is stable, with a creatinine level of 9.8 mg/dL.

The patient is planned for cardiac catheterization with possible coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is being treated with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin. He is also being monitored for ventricular tachycardia and is scheduled for dialysis today.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is still unstable, and he is at risk for further cardiac events, including ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or cardiac arrest.
2. Kidney complications: The patient's kidney function is stable, but he is at risk for further kidney damage or failure, especially with ongoing cardiac damage.
3. Wound complications: The patient's left leg ulcer is chronic and may require further wound care and management.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his low platelet count and ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
5. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and chronic wounds.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's hypercholesterolemia and hyperthyroidism may require further management and monitoring.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may require further management and monitoring.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's poor oral intake may require further nutritional support and management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and implantation of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent. The patient has been in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for several days, with ongoing management of his cardiac, renal, and respiratory conditions.

24-hour events:

* The patient had an episode of hypoxia and shortness of breath, which was treated with IV morphine, nebulizers, and improved with these interventions.
* He was febrile overnight, with a temperature of 101.1°F.
* The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.
* He had a mild episode of chest discomfort during dialysis, which may have been related to flash pulmonary edema.

Current status:

* The patient is currently somnolent but otherwise well-appearing, with a normal blood pressure and oxygen saturation.
* His cardiac examination is normal, with a regular heart rhythm and no murmurs or thrills.
* His lung examination is normal, with no wheezing or crackles.
* His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no signs of ascites or organomegaly.
* His extremities are normal, with 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally and no signs of peripheral edema.
* He has a chronic skin ulcer on his left anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue.

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complex, with a history of CAD, STEMI, and PCI. He is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is also complex, with a history of COPD and wheezing on exam. He is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
* Renal complications: The patient's renal function is compromised, with a history of ESRD on hemodialysis. He is at risk for acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, and electrolyte imbalances.
* Infectious complications: The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, and he has a history of febrile episodes. He is at risk for sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's poor oral intake is a concern, and he may be at risk for malnutrition, weight loss, and decreased immune function.
* Wound complications: The patient's chronic skin ulcer is a concern, and he may be at risk for wound infection, wound dehiscence, and delayed healing."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and extensive regional systolic dysfunction. The patient has undergone CT surgery and is expected to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on Wednesday.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 97/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.3-9.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.2-10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 160-205 K/uL
* Creatinine: 8.0-9.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 12.68-19.10 ng/mL
* Glucose: 99-181 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage.
* Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin was not assessed, but the presence of a wound and potential hypotension may increase the risk of skin breakdown.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is not assessed, but the presence of a wound, fever, and potential hypoxia may affect their mental state.
* Myocardial infarction: The patient has undergone CT surgery and is expected to undergo CABG, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
* Nutritional deficits: The patient's nutritional status is not assessed, but the presence of a wound and potential gastrointestinal symptoms may increase the risk of malnutrition.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may increase the risk of organ damage and hypoperfusion.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, which is scheduled for Wednesday.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg. The patient is receiving heparin infusion and has a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals a somnolent but otherwise well-appearing male with a palpable thrill and audible bruit in the left arm due to an arteriovenous (AV) fistula. The patient has chronic skin changes on both lower extremities consistent with statis dermatitis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), consistent with acute kidney injury and myocardial infarction. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and his platelet count is decreased.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) increase the risk of developing chronic renal failure.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU increase the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity and chronic skin changes increase the risk of developing skin ulcers and infections.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute myocardial infarction and chronic coronary artery disease increase the risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated lung injury.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and previous Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), which was treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a left anterior descending (LAD) bare metal stent. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. He has a mild left ventricular cavity enlargement with extensive regional systolic dysfunction and mild aortic regurgitation. His troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury.

The patient has a history of poor oral intake, which has led to weight loss. He is also at risk for bleeding due to his history of CVA and the use of anticoagulant medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Heart failure due to ongoing myocardial injury
	* Ventricular arrhythmias due to the presence of a bare metal stent
	* Increased risk of bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant medications
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury due to dehydration or contrast-induced nephropathy
	* Delayed healing of the wound due to impaired renal function
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia due to aspiration or respiratory failure
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis or cardiac failure
4. Neurological complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to the presence of a bare metal stent
	* Seizures due to electrolyte imbalance or medication side effects
5. Infectious complications:
	* Sepsis due to a urinary tract infection or other sources
	* Wound infection due to poor wound care or impaired immune function

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his management plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient began to have a mix of BRBPR and melena during the morning.
   His heparin gtt was stopped.  He remains on ASA.  The CT torso was
   deferred today due to this.  His SBP's were on the low side in the 80's

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of CAD, ESRD on HD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and PAF, who presented with STEMI from OSH and was s/p BMS to mid-LAD. The patient has been experiencing a mix of BRBPR and melena during the morning, which led to stopping his heparin gtt and deferring the CT torso. His Hct dropped from 30.4 to 26.1, and he received 2 units of PRBC. The patient is now on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and has a plan to get the CT torso and EGD to identify the cause of the bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.4°C, Tcurrent of 36.6°C, HR of 73 bpm, BP of 108/54 mmHg, RR of 20 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. His physical examination is notable for a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, and a soft, non-tender abdomen.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 8.3-9.6 K/μL, Hct of 26.1-30.4%, and platelet count of 123-205 K/μL. His troponin-T levels are elevated at 12.68-23.80 ng/mL, and his CK/CKMB/Trop-T levels are elevated at 619/21/23.80 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and further bleeding complications can occur, such as hypovolemic shock, organ failure, or death.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone PCI to OM1, and has a BMS stent to mid-LAD. He is at risk for cardiac complications such as MI, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD on HD and is at risk for worsening renal function, acute kidney injury, or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for infection complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections, due to his immunosuppressed state and indwelling catheters.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has COPD and is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had a mix of BRBPR and dark
   stool concerning for melena yesterday.  His Hct dropped from 30 to 26
   and only rose to 29.4 with 2 units of blood.  He continues to have
   slight oozing of dark stool today.  GI evaluated the patient and felt
   his GI bleed was very likely from a lower GI source such as bowel
   ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer (especially given his
   recent 100 lb weight loss).  GI feels the patient is at very high risk
   for both colonoscopy or EGD.  The patient
s SBP have been low in the
   80
s to 100
s, however he has remained Hemodynamically stable, making a
   brisk UGIB unlikely.  The heparin gtt was stopped yesterday when he
   started to bleed.
   -  Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   -  Patient will go for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
   possible causes of LGIB.
   -  Will check Hct q6h and transfuse for Hct < 30 given recent ischemia.
   -  Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort two
   days ago at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   - Given his recent GI bleed, unlikely to go for CABG in the near future
   (as this would require a heparin bolus).
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - After discussion on rounds today, it was decided to restart him on
   Plavix (as the heparin gtt was stopped) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - Can consider stenting the LAD instead of CABG depending on the cause
   of his bleed and how long it lasts.
   .
   # PUMP: Echo with LVEF 25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum
   and anterior walls, distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and
   dyskinetic and remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart once his
   pressures become more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.
   - continue to monitor on tele

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of CAD, PAF, ESRD on HD, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia, who presented with STEMI from OSH and underwent PCI to OM1 and BMS to mid-LAD. He is currently in the ICU due to a GI bleed, which is suspected to be a lower GI bleed, possibly from bowel ischemia, diverticulosis, or cancer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a drop in hemoglobin from 30.4 to 26.1, which was partially corrected with 2 units of packed red blood cells. His platelet count is 123 K/uL, and his troponin-T levels are elevated.

The patient's medical history includes a CVA, and he is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin. However, the heparin gtt was stopped due to the GI bleed. He is also on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and he is scheduled to undergo a CT torso with contrast to evaluate the cause of the GI bleed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at high risk for bleeding complications due to his anticoagulation therapy and the GI bleed.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and STEMI, and is at risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
3. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD on HD, and is at risk for renal complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has COPD and is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
5. Wound complications: The patient has a chronic left leg ulcer and is at risk for wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, and delayed healing.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continued anticoagulation therapy with aspirin and beta-blocker, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and cardiovascular support with statin and beta-blocker. He is also scheduled to undergo a CT torso with contrast to evaluate the cause of the GI bleed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had a mix of BRBPR and dark
   stool concerning for melena yesterday.  His Hct dropped from 30 to 26
   and only rose to 29.4 with 2 units of blood.  He continues to have
   slight oozing of dark stool today.  GI evaluated the patient and felt
   his GI bleed was very likely from a lower GI source such as bowel
   ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer (especially given his
   recent 100 lb weight loss).  GI feels the patient is at very high risk
   for both colonoscopy or EGD.  The patient
s SBP have been low in the
   80
s to 100
s, however he has remained Hemodynamically stable, making a
   brisk UGIB unlikely.  The heparin gtt was stopped yesterday when he
   started to bleed.
   -  Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   -  Patient will go for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
   possible causes of LGIB.
   -  Will check Hct q6h and transfuse for Hct < 30 given recent ischemia.
   -  Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort two
   days ago at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   - Given his recent GI bleed, unlikely to go for CABG in the near future
   (as this would require a heparin bolus).
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - After discussion on rounds today, it was decided to restart him on
   Plavix (as the heparin gtt was stopped) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - Can consider stenting the LAD instead of CABG depending on the cause
   of his bleed and how long it lasts.
   .
   # PUMP: Echo with LVEF 25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum
   and anterior walls, distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and
   dyskinetic and remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart once his
   pressures become more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD on HD: unclear origin of disease.  Pt dialyzed M, W, F.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to the recent colonoscopy and EGD being contraindicated. The CT scan showing bowel wall thickening at the rectosigmoid junction and the patient's recent 100-pound weight loss increase the risk of colon cancer. The patient's hemodynamically stable condition makes a brisk upper gastrointestinal bleed unlikely, but the patient is still at risk for further bleeding.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and the recent STEMI and catheterization showing 3-vessel disease increase the risk of cardiac complications. The patient is at high risk of instent thrombosis, and restarting Plavix may help reduce this risk.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's unclear origin of ESRD and need for dialysis three times a week increase the risk of further kidney damage. The patient's recent hypotension may be related to their ESRD, and the patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's recent episode of chest discomfort at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema, increases the risk of further pulmonary complications.
5. Weight Loss: The patient's 100-pound weight loss and poor PO intake may be related to underlying malignancy, metabolic disorder, or gastrointestinal disease. The patient's stool guaiac test is positive, and an outpatient colonoscopy is recommended.
6. Left Leg Ulcer: The patient's chronic left leg ulcer increases the risk of infection and wound complications.
7. Cerebrovascular Accident: The patient's history of CVA increases the risk of further cerebrovascular complications.
8. Cardiac Failure: The patient's recent STEMI and catheterization showing 3-vessel disease increase the risk of cardiac failure. The patient's LVEF is 25-30%, and the patient's heart failure symptoms should be closely monitored.

The patient's medical team should closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a complex medical history, including End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and a recent ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). He has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is stable, with normal vital signs and no signs of cardiovascular instability. However, he continues to experience gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely related to a carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction.

The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with Plavix, which was restarted yesterday, and has undergone a CT scan showing bowel wall thickening at the rectosigmoid junction. A platelet study showed abnormal collagen but otherwise normal results.

The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including a previous episode of ventricular fibrillation (VFib) and has undergone cardiac catheterization with placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare metal stent. He is currently taking aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values for troponin-T, creatinine, and electrolytes. His echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% with near akinesis of the distal septum and anterior walls.

The patient's medical complications include gastrointestinal bleeding, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He is at high risk for developing further complications, including:

1. Ischemic events: The patient's history of CAD and recent STEMI puts him at risk for further ischemic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant concern and may require further intervention, including endoscopy and tissue diagnosis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VFib and current use of anticoagulation therapy increase his risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
4. Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent episode of hypotension increase his risk for developing further renal complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. His ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease make him a high-risk patient who requires careful management and consideration for further interventions, including endoscopy, cardiac catheterization, and potential surgery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA). He was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and was found to have 3-vessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He underwent placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare metal stent (BMS) and is currently awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, his recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed has delayed his surgical plans. He is currently receiving treatment for his GI bleed, and his medical condition is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent GI bleed is a significant concern, and he will need to be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding or perforation. He will also require further evaluation and treatment to determine the cause of the bleeding and to prevent future episodes.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's 3-vessel disease and recent STEMI increase his risk of future cardiac events, including recurrent MI, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD will require ongoing management with hemodialysis, and he will need to be closely monitored for any changes in his kidney function.
4. Cerebral Vascular Accident: The patient's previous CVA increases his risk of future cerebrovascular events, including recurrent stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
5. Infection: The patient's recent GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization increase his risk of developing an infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's recent GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and increase his risk of complications.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's recent STEMI and cardiac catheterization increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's recent GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization may lead to respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his progress and address any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), which was treated with cardiac catheterization and implantation of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent.

The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which was attributed to the administration of heparin. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed thickening at the rectosigmoid junction, likely due to carcinoma, which is the source of bleeding.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. However, he has a history of ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) and is at risk for recurrent arrhythmias.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is wheezing on examination.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is compromised, with a chronic left leg ulcer and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He is at risk for further bleeding and requires ongoing monitoring and management.

The patient's renal status is stable, with ongoing hemodialysis three times a week. He is also at risk for electrolyte imbalances and requires ongoing monitoring and management.

The patient's medication list includes aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and Plavix. He is also receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleed and chronic ulceration on his left leg put him at risk for further bleeding.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation and ongoing treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications put him at risk for recurrent arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's underlying chronic kidney disease and ongoing hemodialysis put him at risk for further renal decline.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD and ongoing wheezing on examination put him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's ongoing hemodialysis and medication regimen put him at risk for electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical issues. He requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent. He developed a lower gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed) while on heparin, which was managed with transfusions and discontinuation of heparin. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is stable at 32%. He is currently awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is being treated with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, especially if heparin is restarted or if there is any delay in his CABG surgery.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and has had a STEMI, which puts him at risk for further cardiac events, such as recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis, which puts him at risk for further kidney damage or failure.
4. Cerebrovascular Accident: The patient has a history of CVA and is at risk for further cerebrovascular events, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack.
5. Wound Infection: The patient has a chronic leg ulcer, which is at risk for infection and may require further surgical intervention.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient has COPD and is at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalance, especially potassium and magnesium, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, especially with his chronic medical conditions and recent hospitalization.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's hematocrit closely and transfuse as needed to maintain a stable HCT.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medications as needed to prevent further cardiac events.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his dialysis schedule as needed to prevent further kidney damage or failure.
4. Monitor the patient's wound and provide wound care as needed to prevent infection and promote healing.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed to prevent respiratory complications.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medications as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and provide antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent sepsis.
8. Consider consulting a wound care specialist to further manage the patient's chronic leg ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of STEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization, resulting in a left anterior descending (LAD) bare metal stent (BMS) placement.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no further episodes of chest discomfort or STEMI. His heart rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and he is being monitored for any signs of ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which occurred when heparin was started, has resolved, and his hematocrit (Hct) is stable at 32%. He is being managed with daily Hct monitoring and type and screen, as well as PIV access.

The patient's coronary disease is stable, with no further episodes of chest discomfort since his initial presentation. He is being managed with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin, and is scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) next week.

The patient's chronic systolic heart failure is being managed with a beta-blocker and statin, and he is awaiting CABG.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal, and he is being monitored for any signs of VT.

The patient's ESRD on hemodialysis is being managed with dialysis three times a week, and he is being followed up with renal recommendations.

The patient's COPD is being managed with PRN nebs.

The patient's left leg ulcer is chronic and requires wound care consult.

The patient's CVA history is being managed with continued ASA and Plavix.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to be called out to the floor today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent GI bleed and the ongoing use of heparin and aspirin may increase the risk of further bleeding.
2. Coronary artery disease progression: The patient's CAD may continue to progress, leading to further complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's chronic heart failure and ESRD may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CVA history and ongoing CAD may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications.
6. Wound infection: The patient's chronic left leg ulcer may become infected, leading to further complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's ongoing use of medications and his ESRD may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
9. Blood clotting disorders: The patient's ongoing use of heparin and aspirin may increase his risk of developing blood clotting disorders.
10. Cognitive impairment: The patient's CVA history may have caused cognitive impairment, which may worsen over time.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), was treated with a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent, and is awaiting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). He also had a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which was attributed to ischemia, and has been stable with no further bleeding episodes.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%, and has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since his previous ventricular fibrillation (VT) episodes. He has chronic skin changes on his lower extremities and a left leg ulcer, which appears chronic.

The patient is currently receiving hemodialysis three times a week and is taking various medications, including aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and Plavix. He is also receiving wound care and is awaiting outpatient colonoscopy and further evaluation for his gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed recurrence: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed was attributed to ischemia, but it is possible that it could recur, especially if the patient is not adequately managed.
2. Coronary artery disease progression: The patient has significant coronary artery disease and may be at risk for further progression, which could lead to recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
3. Left leg ulcer infection: The patient's left leg ulcer appears chronic and may be at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
4. Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient has End-Stage Renal Disease and may be at risk for further progression, which could lead to the need for dialysis or transplantation.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CVA and may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Significant atherosclerotic disease involving the carotid arteries

   proximal
   left cervical internal carotid artery. No flow limitation distally.
   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease while
   awaiting CABG had a lower GI bleed.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Pt started to have GI bleed when heparin was
   started.  CT scan showed thickening at rectosigmoid junction concerning
   for cancer, however a flex sig yesterday by GI showed no mass and only
   erythema at the recto-sigmoid junction which was likely secondary to
   ischemia.  Hct is stable at 32 today and no further passage of bloody
   stools.  Pt
s daughter reports that he had colonoscopy within the last
   3 months which did not show etiology of bleed.
   - Daily HCT
   - Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   - will need outpatient colonoscopy and further evaluation as inpatient
   if pt starts to bleed again
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort with
   dialysis on [**2110-11-10**], none since.
   - As the patient is no longer having a GI bleed and its origin was from
   ischemia, the patient can likely have his CABG next week.
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - Continue on Plavix (started [**2110-11-12**]) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - will need to discuss with CT surgery regarding potential stent to
   carotids given CT findings
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with chronic systolic heart failure - Echo with LVEF
   25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum and anterior walls,
   distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and dyskinetic and
   remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart after CABG.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD on HD: unclear origin of disease.  Pt dialyzed M, W, F.
   - continue dialysis M, W, F
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue Sevelamer, Nephrocaps
   .
   # COPD: pt wheezing on exam
   - PRN nebs
   .
   # Left leg ulcer: appears chronic
   - wound care consult
   .
   # Hx of CVA:
   - continue ASA, Plavix
   .
   #  FEN: cardiac, renal diet, replete lytes as needed
   .
   #  Prophylaxis: PPI as per home tx, bowel regimen
   .
   #  Access: 2 PIV on right arm, fistula left arm
   .
   #  Code Status: FULL, confirmed with patient and daughter

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key points:

1. The patient has had no further bleeding episodes and his hematocrit (HCT) has been stable.
2. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute.
3. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% and he is not requiring any oxygen therapy.
4. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm and his blood glucose level is 99 mg/dL.
5. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, and has had a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI) with a stent placement in the left anterior descending artery.
6. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25-30%.
7. The patient has a left leg ulcer that appears chronic and is being managed with wound care.
8. The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is taking aspirin and Plavix to prevent further episodes.
9. The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and is taking Sevelamer and Nephrocaps to manage his renal disease.
10. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is wheezing on examination.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further bleeding episodes, particularly if the patient's hemostasis is not adequate.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and chronic systolic heart failure.
3. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, given the patient's history of COPD and wheezing on examination.
4. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, given the patient's history of ESRD on HD and taking nephrotoxic medications.
5. Infectious complications, such as sepsis or wound infection, given the patient's history of chronic skin changes and left leg ulcer.
6. Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, given the patient's history of CVA and taking anticoagulant medications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, given the patient's history of lower GI bleed and taking medications that can cause gastrointestinal side effects.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with regular assessments of his vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory values."
