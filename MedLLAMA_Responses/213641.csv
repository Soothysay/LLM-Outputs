   Imaging: Very limited examination without IV contrast (due to the
   patient's renal insufficiency), with:
   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5
   nerve
   root.
   3. No specific finding on the STIR sequence, evidence of endplate or
   disc
   destruction or epidural or paraspinal fluid collection to specifically
   suggest
   the vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis/epidural abscess complex.

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.
   OSH Records:
   RP Ultrasound [**2146-8-1**]: left renal cyst, no hydro
   CT [**2146-8-3**]: PO no IV contrast: sigmoid diverticula without
   diverticulitis, large left inguinal hernia with mesenteric and smll
   knuckle of nondistended distal colon.
   Echo [**2146-8-3**]: EF 60%, mild AR, now AS. Mild tr. No vegetation..
   [**2146-8-4**]: LENIs negative for DVT
   SPEP pending
   Negative lyme, RF, [**Doctor First Name **], hepatitis, neg lipase.
   Creatine had been 2.5. Basleline 1.5-2, up to 3. has been having
   prostatic symptoms, underwent prostatic bx [**2143**].
   TURP [**2-20**]. h/o gout, asthma
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema:
   Combination of demand ischemia in setting of hypertension, possible
   component of aortic stenosis.
   - Largely improved; will largely run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - consider tagged WBC scan since gadolinium is not ideal.
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone.
   # NSTEMI
   - likely demand ischemia in setting of hypertension/tachycardia, less
   likely distal LAD. No associated ECG changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above.
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF, primary team to
   confirm home regimen in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5
   nerve
   root.
   3. No specific finding on the STIR sequence, evidence of endplate or
   disc
   destruction or epidural or paraspinal fluid collection to specifically
   suggest
   the vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis/epidural abscess complex.

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema:
   Combination of demand ischemia in setting of hypertension, possible
   component of aortic stenosis.
   - Largely improved; will largely run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - consider tagged WBC scan since gadolinium is not ideal.
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone.
   # NSTEMI
   - likely demand ischemia in setting of hypertension/tachycardia, less
   likely distal LAD. No associated ECG changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above.
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF, primary team to
   confirm home regimen in AM.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who was transferred to the MICU with respiratory distress and fever. He has a history of hypertension, asthma, and recently underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). 

The patient was diagnosed with NSTEMI and was started on heparin and beta blockers. He also has evidence of acute pulmonary edema, which is thought to be secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and possible aortic stenosis. 

The patient has a concerning picture of a strep endovascular infection or primary discitis/abscess, which is growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and a tagged WBC scan was considered to assess for valvular vegetations. 

The patient's lower back pain is suspicious for an epidural abscess or discitis, and he will undergo further work-up. He also has tachycardia, which is thought to be secondary to volume depletion and pain. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has a history of paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible M spike. His anemia is likely related to underlying inflammation, and he will undergo further evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and acute pulmonary edema put him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
2. Infectious complications: The patient's suspected strep endovascular infection or primary discitis/abscess can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction.
3. Renal complications: The patient's impaired renal function can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's acute pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure, respiratory acidosis, and need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's suspected epidural abscess or discitis can lead to neurological deficits, spinal cord compression, and paralysis.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's paraproteinemia/myeloma can lead to bleeding complications, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gout can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   - transferred to MICU
   - ruled in for NSTEMI, started heparin
   - cards recs: believes it is all demand ischemia; BP control with beta
   blocker +/- imdur/hydral, wean nitro, trend enzymes, can turn off
   heparin gtt off on [**9-20**], at this point with fevers then no indication
   for cath. would need stress test prior to any surgery, does not believe
   there is a need for TEE unless continues to have blood cultures +
   through tues/wed --> started bb 25 TID, ASA 325
   - TTE completed
   - Nsurg: no obvious collection on MRI, will need MRI with contrast in
   future, but no nsurg emergent issues
   - Urine with granular casts
   - resent nasopharyngeal aspirate - not good specimen
   - BPs similar in both arms
   - [**Hospital1 **] OSH records obtained
   - talked to PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9219**]; pt with frequent asthmatic

   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5

   root.

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Improved with nitro and lasix, on 4L
   - Largely improved; will run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   -started on beta blocker today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone; f/u vanc level
   -if negative consider tagged wbc scan
   # NSTEMI- likely demand ischemia in setting of
   hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above
   -morphine for pain
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   -renally dose meds
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF,

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's fever has increased to 101.8°F, and blood cultures have been taken. The patient has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly. The patient's pain has been managed with dilaudid, and their blood pressure has been controlled with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, blood cultures, and antibiotic adjustments, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and potential sepsis could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's existing renal failure could worsen due to sepsis, antibiotics, or other medications.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension, cardiac history, and potential sepsis could lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's urinary tract infection could lead to complications such as abscesses, septic shock, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and potential sepsis could lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is unclear, and potential sepsis or other complications could lead to neurological deterioration.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary based on blood culture results.
3. Maintain proper pain management with dilaudid and other analgesics.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider further cardiac evaluation and management to prevent cardiac complications.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust stress ulcer prophylaxis as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as necessary."

Based on the 24-hour events, the patient's condition is as follows:

The patient has developed a fever of 101.8°F, and blood cultures have grown Enterococcus species. The patient's neurological examination is changing, and they are experiencing back pain, which neurosurgery suspects may be related to an infection. The patient's C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated, indicating inflammation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 13.9-17.6 K/uL, indicating an elevated WBC count
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.0-10.5 g/dL, indicating anemia
* Platelet count (Plt): 314-343 K/uL, indicating thrombocytopenia
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.2-2.3 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury
* Troponin-T: 0.32-0.36 ng/mL, indicating myocardial injury
* Glucose: 117-145 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Ill appearance
* EOMI (eyes open to voice), anicteric, PERRL (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light), OP (ocular pressure normal)
* CTAB (chest clear to auscultation)
* RRR (regular rate and rhythm) on cardiovascular examination
* NDNT (normal abdominal tenderness), soft, NABS (no abdominal bruit or mass)
* Large amount of TTP (tenderness to palpation) over the low spine process, paraspinal tenderness on back examination
* A&O (alert and oriented) on neurological examination
* No rashes on dermatological examination

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

* Sepsis due to the Enterococcus infection
* Worsening of acute kidney injury
* Myocardial injury or infarction
* Hyperglycemia-related complications
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other underlying conditions
* Neurological deterioration due to the suspected infection or underlying condition
* Gastrointestinal complications due to stress ulcer or other underlying conditions

The patient's plan of care should include:

* Administration of antibiotics to treat the Enterococcus infection
* Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings
* Management of hyperglycemia and acute kidney injury
* Close monitoring of neurological and cardiovascular status
* Consideration of further imaging studies to evaluate the underlying condition and potential complications
* Collaboration with neurosurgery and other specialists to develop a comprehensive treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - WBC scan in lieu of MRI L spine (to be started today and completed
   tomorrow)
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - WBC scan in lieu of MRI L spine (to be started today and completed
   tomorrow)
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 76-year-old male, was transferred to the ICU with respiratory distress and fever. He has a history of aortic valve endocarditis, likely secondary to a recent TURP procedure. He is currently receiving treatment for this condition, including antibiotics and pain management. He also has acute pulmonary edema, which has improved with treatment. Additionally, he has elevated troponins, likely due to demand ischemia, and is being managed accordingly. He is experiencing low back pain, which is suspicious for epidural abscess or discitis, and is undergoing further evaluation. He also has renal failure, which is likely chronic, and is being managed with renally dosed medications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Epidural Abscess or Discitis:** The patient's low back pain, fever, and leukocytosis are suspicious for an epidural abscess or discitis. If left untreated, this can lead to further complications, such as nerve damage, paralysis, or even death.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. This can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and even death if not promptly treated.
3. **Acute Kidney Injury:** The patient's renal failure is likely chronic, but the use of nephrotoxic medications and the presence of sepsis can further exacerbate this condition, leading to acute kidney injury.
4. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's elevated troponins and history of hypertension and tachycardia increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
5. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress increase his risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or even death.
6. **Infective Endocarditis:** The patient's aortic valve endocarditis is a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis, which can lead to further complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or even death.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue antibiotics and pain management as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and other vital signs closely for signs of sepsis or infection.
3. Perform a WBC scan to evaluate for epidural abscess or discitis.
4. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with renally dosed medications.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his troponin levels, and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary status and adjust his oxygen therapy as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with infectious disease and cardiology specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - appreciate neurosurgery following/
   - WBC scan pending
   - MRI L Spine with gadolinium today despite renal risk given changing
   neuro exam.
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   - q2h neurochecks
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress. He was found to have aortic valve endocarditis, likely secondary to a recent TURP procedure. He also has acute pulmonary edema, elevated troponins, and renal failure. He has a history of chronic renal failure and is being worked up for paraproteinemia/myeloma.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 101.8°F, HR 86 bpm, BP 150/67 mmHg, RR 16 insp/min, SpO2 96%
* Laboratory results: WBC 13.9, Hct 31.1, Plt 314, Cr 2.2 mg/dL, TropT 0.36 ng/mL, Glucose 145 mg/dL
* Radiology: Blood culture shows Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains
* Physical examination: The patient is ill appearing with a large amount of TTP over the low spine process, paraspinal tenderness, and decreased strength in dorsiflexion of the left and right feet.

Potential medical complications:

1. Aortic valve endocarditis: The patient's condition is likely to worsen if the infection is not effectively treated.
2. Epidural abscess or discitis: The patient's low back pain, leukocytosis, and acute lower back pain suggest the possibility of an epidural abscess or discitis.
3. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient's condition may worsen if the pulmonary edema is not effectively treated.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to worsen if not effectively managed.
5. Gout: The patient's gout may worsen if not effectively managed.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a secondary infection, particularly in the setting of his immunosuppressed state.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponins and tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's decreased strength in dorsiflexion of the left and right feet suggests the possibility of neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy or myelitis.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The patient's care plan should include:

1. Aggressive treatment of the aortic valve endocarditis, including antibiotics and surgical intervention if necessary.
2. Treatment of the epidural abscess or discitis, including antibiotics and surgical intervention if necessary.
3. Management of the acute pulmonary edema, including diuretics and vasodilators.
4. Management of the renal failure, including dialysis and renally adjusted medications.
5. Management of the gout, including medications and lifestyle modifications.
6. Monitoring for secondary infections, particularly in the setting of his immunosuppressed state.
7. Monitoring for cardiac complications, including electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes.
8. Monitoring for neurological complications, including neurological exams and imaging studies.
9. Monitoring for respiratory complications, including respiratory therapy and oxygen therapy."

   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA with encouragement
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF
   # constipation: add bowel regimen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical condition. Here is a summary of the patient's current status and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient has been admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
* He has been diagnosed with enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural abscesses.
* He has a history of recent demand ischemia and has been treated with ampicillin and ceftriaxone.
* He has also been diagnosed with chronic renal failure and anemia, and is being worked up for paraproteinemia/myeloma.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis and multiple small epidural abscesses increase the risk of septic shock.
2. **Organ Failure:** The patient's chronic renal failure and anemia increase the risk of organ failure, particularly in the setting of sepsis.
3. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's recent demand ischemia and aortic valve endocarditis increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. **Neurological Complications:** The patient's epidural abscesses and potential spinal cord compression increase the risk of neurological complications, such as paralysis, numbness, and weakness.
5. **Infection Spread:** The patient's enterococcal infection and multiple small epidural abscesses increase the risk of infection spread to other parts of the body, such as the bloodstream, lungs, and brain.
6. **Renal Failure Progression:** The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen in the setting of sepsis, particularly if not adequately managed.
7. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's flash pulmonary edema and potential respiratory distress increase the risk of pulmonary complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

**Recommendations:**

1. **Close Monitoring:** The patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, organ failure, and cardiac complications.
2. **Aggressive Antibiotic Therapy:** The patient should receive aggressive antibiotic therapy to treat his enterococcal infection and prevent the spread of infection.
3. **Pain Management:** The patient should receive adequate pain management to prevent tachycardia and cardiac complications.
4. **Renal Failure Management:** The patient's chronic renal failure should be managed aggressively to prevent worsening of renal function.
5. **Neurological Monitoring:** The patient should be closely monitored for neurological complications, such as paralysis, numbness, and weakness.
6. **Pulmonary Support:** The patient should receive pulmonary support, such as mechanical ventilation, if necessary, to manage respiratory distress.
7. **Cardiac Support:** The patient should receive cardiac support, such as beta blockers and statins, to manage cardiac complications."

   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2146-9-20**].
   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the 24-hour events and the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, and has shown some improvement in his condition. However, the patient still has a high fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient's blood cultures have grown Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin, and levofoxacin. The patient has also developed several small abscesses at the level of L5, which may be related to discitis L5/S1. The patient's pain has been managed with PCA, diazepam, and neurontin, and his hypertension has been controlled with labetalol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI) complications: The patient's UTI may lead to complications such as pyelonephritis, kidney abscesses, or septic shock.
3. Discitis L5/S1 complications: The patient's discitis L5/S1 may lead to complications such as spinal cord compression, nerve root damage, or epidural abscess.
4. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection: The patient's MRSA screen is positive, which may indicate a potential infection.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's chest radiograph shows a right upper lobe perihilar opacity with bronchial wall thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations, which may be consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and the presence of abscesses and discitis may lead to neurological complications such as spinal cord compression, nerve root damage, or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of improvement.
2. Consider adding an antifungal agent to the patient's antibiotic regimen, given the presence of MRSA.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider imaging studies to rule out spinal cord compression or epidural abscess.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain and hypertension as prescribed.
5. Consider consulting with a neurosurgeon to discuss the patient's discitis L5/S1 and potential surgical options.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to discuss the patient's cardiovascular instability and potential treatment options."

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. He was found to have enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural abscesses. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 38.3°C, T-current 37.1°C, HR 88 bpm, BP 144/54 mmHg, RR 16 breaths/min, SpO2 96%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 13.9 K/μL, Hct 31.1%, Plt 401 K/μL, Cr 2.2 mg/dL, TropT 0.36 ng/mL, Glucose 145 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: MRI L-spine shows multiple loculated fluid collections within the posterior epidural space, causing severe spinal canal narrowing. There is also T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the level of L5/S1 and L1/L2, which may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes.
* Medical treatment: The patient is being treated with ampicillin and ceftriaxone for enterococcal infection, and neurontin, valium, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. He is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin.
* Complications: The patient has developed tachycardia, likely secondary to pain, and renal failure, which is likely chronic in nature. He also has anemia, which may be related to underlying inflammation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progression of the epidural abscesses: The patient's condition can worsen if the abscesses do not respond to treatment or if there is a delay in surgical intervention.
2. Aortic valve endocarditis: The patient is at risk of developing complications related to aortic valve endocarditis, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or valve destruction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to decline if not managed appropriately.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if not managed properly.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.

In conclusion, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address the patient's underlying conditions and prevent future complications."
