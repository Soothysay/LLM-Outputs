   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid for now
   - check phenytoin level in a.m.; most recent level 22.5; goal 15-20
   - EEG
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - continue insulin gtt
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given
   - q1hr FS
   - q4hr chemistry
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue empiric CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   - maintain ventilatory support for now
   - will wean off once underlying seizure and hyperglycemia resolve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes, seizure disorder, hypertension, patent foramen ovale, and transient ischemic attack. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following conditions:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
3. Altered mental status

The patient is receiving the following treatments:

1. Insulin drip for hyperglycemia
2. Fentanyl and midazolam infusions for sedation
3. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir antibiotics for suspected infection
4. Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
5. H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis
6. Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Seizure recurrence due to non-compliance with antiepileptic medication or underlying meningitis/encephalitis
2. Worsening of DKA due to inadequate treatment or delayed correction of hyperglycemia
3. Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or underlying lung disease
4. Infection due to undiagnosed or untreated underlying condition
5. Metabolic derangements due to altered mental status or underlying medical condition
6. DVT or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and hypercoagulability
7. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged use of H2 blockers or other medications
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her conditions, including frequent blood glucose checks, insulin adjustments, and respiratory support."

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid
   - check phenytoin level at 9:00. goal 15-20
   - EEG
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - ISS, f/u lytes at 9:00
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given
   - q1hr FS
   - q4hr chemistry
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue empiric CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   -          wean vent settings now that underlying seizure and
   hyperglycemia appear resolved

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's 24-hour events include the insertion of a presep catheter, weaning off insulin gtt, repletion of lytes, and no evidence of seizure activity. She was also treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of blood glucose, ketones, and anion gap, consistent with DKA. Her white blood cell count is 9.6 K/uL, and her platelet count is 288 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient is being treated with insulin and is expected to recover.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is expected to be weaned off the ventilator.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is expected to improve with treatment of her DKA and seizure disorder.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient is being treated with phenytoin and is expected to have a seizure-free period.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her altered mental status and respiratory failure.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to her DKA and treatment with insulin.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and treatment with mechanical ventilation.
4. Seizure recurrence: The patient is at risk for seizure recurrence due to her seizure disorder and underlying medical conditions.
5. Worsening of DKA: The patient is at risk for worsening of her DKA due to her underlying medical conditions and treatment with insulin.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and she is expected to recover with continued treatment and management of her underlying medical conditions."

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA, or SDH.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 8hrs
 corrected level this am 25
   - check phenytoin level tomorrow am
   - EEG results pending
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   - F/U final read MRI. Prelim read- tiny subdural left parietal region
   without mass effect on the underlying brain. No evidence for acute
   ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap (now 5)--could
   be due to good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely
   due to recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out
   infection.
   - ISS
   - Cont NS at 150cc/hr for now
   - FS per protocol.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. SDH could be from activity during seizure or could have
   preceded AMS.  Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   -          Pt currently doing well on PS 8, PEEP 5
   -          Attempt extubation today- will need to lighten sedation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and has had multiple seizures, which increases the risk of future seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on ventilator support, which increases the risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and a prolonged prothrombin time, which may indicate an underlying infection.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) complications: The patient has a history of type II diabetes and DKA, which increases the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis.
5. Subdural hematoma (SDH) complications: The patient has a small SDH, which may increase the risk of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and brain herniation if not managed properly.
6. Metabolic derangements: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and may have underlying metabolic derangements such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infections: The patient has a history of viral encephalitis and may be at risk for other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and may be at risk for neurological complications such as brain edema, herniation, or stroke.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac arrest.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of poor dentition and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration, nausea, or vomiting.

The patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, as well as management of her seizure disorder, DKA, and respiratory failure."

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid
   - check phenytoin level at 9:00. goal 15-20
   - EEG
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - ISS, f/u lytes at 9:00
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given
   - q1hr FS
   - q4hr chemistry
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue empiric CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   -          wean vent settings now that underlying seizure and
   hyperglycemia appear resolved
   -          Attempt extubation today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with a normal anion gap.

The patient has been diagnosed with subdural hemorrhage (SDH), seizure, without status epilepticus, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 100 bpm (94-112 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 98/55 mmHg (64-138/71-89 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute (10-20 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 100%
* Height: 65 inches

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Fentanyl: 50 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed): 3 mg/hour
* Famotidine (Pepcid): [**2197-11-11**] 07:31 AM
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis): [**2197-11-11**] 07:34 AM

The patient has the following laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 9.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 288 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.8 mg/dL

The patient has the following radiology results:

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 3-4mm left parietal subdural hemorrhage.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing phenytoin 100 mg tid to manage seizure activity
* Monitoring phenytoin levels to ensure therapeutic levels
* Performing an electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess seizure activity
* Implementing seizure precautions
* Following up with neurology recommendations
* Managing hyperglycemia with insulin sliding scale
* Ruling out infection with HSV PCR, blood culture, and urine culture
* Continuing empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir
* Weaning vent settings and attempting extubation today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Seizure recurrence or status epilepticus
* Respiratory failure or ARDS
* Infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) complications, such as acidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or cardiac arrhythmias
* Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, or brain herniation
* Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology findings to detect any potential complications and adjust the plan accordingly."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA, or SDH.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 12 hrs
 corrected level yest 25.
   Awaiting results of todays labs
   - EEG results pending
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs- will need rpt CT head on Mon to f/u SDH
   - F/U final read MRI. Prelim read- tiny subdural left parietal region
   without mass effect on the underlying brain. No evidence for acute
   ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap (now 8)--could
   be due to good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely
   due to recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out
   infection.
   - ISS
   - Cont D5NS at 150cc/hr for now
   - FS per protocol.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. SDH could be from activity during seizure or could have
   preceded AMS.  Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue acyclovir for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and was found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria with a normal anion gap.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status (not delirium) due to possible DKA, seizure, and SDH
* Impaired skin integrity
* Subdural hemorrhage (SDH)
* Seizure, without status epilepticus
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated glucose levels (151 mg/dL)
* Elevated anion gap (8)
* Elevated creatinine (0.7 mg/dL)
* Elevated potassium (5.9 mmol/L)
* Elevated magnesium (1.7 mg/dL)
* Elevated phosphorus (2.7 mg/dL)
* Low albumin (2.7 g/dL)
* Elevated Ca++ (7.7 mg/dL)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 12 hrs to treat seizure
* Awaiting results of today's labs
* EEG results pending
* Seizure precautions
* Follow-up neuro recommendations, including rpt CT head on Mon to f/u SDH
* F/U final read MRI, which showed a tiny subdural left parietal region without mass effect on the underlying brain

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Seizure recurrence
* DKA exacerbation
* Respiratory failure
* Infection (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis)
* Skin breakdown
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypokalemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hypophosphatemia
* Hypocalcemia

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."
