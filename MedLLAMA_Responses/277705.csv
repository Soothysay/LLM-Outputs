You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a fever of 102.0°F (38.9°C) and tachycardia. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse and has been receiving antibiotics for an unknown infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen therapy with a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 28. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a low phosphate level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's low phosphate level may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further bleeding complications.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of underlying cardiac complications or may be a side effect of medications.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's fever of 102.0°F (38.9°C) may lead to hypothermia if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient's unknown infection may lead to further complications if not properly treated.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and seizures.
8. Sepsis: The patient's unknown infection may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch-tall adult with a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's 24-hour events include an echocardiogram showing a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with sparing of the apex, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealing numerous pulmonary nodules, and a diagnosis of Staph aureus bacteremia. The patient's blood cultures were drawn again, and Nadolol was initiated tomorrow due to low-normal blood pressures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.9°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/58 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of Staph aureus bacteremia and fever may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's echocardiogram showing a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with sparing of the apex may indicate endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CTA did not reveal a PE, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results may still indicate a high risk for PE, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
5. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's low phosphate levels may indicate a risk for muscle weakness, fatigue, and other complications.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, including hypokalemia, may lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
7. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's bacteremia and fever may lead to infection-related complications, such as septic shock, respiratory failure, and other organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely for signs of sepsis, endocarditis, or other complications.
2. Administer antibiotics as prescribed to treat the Staph aureus bacteremia.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust Nadolol as needed to maintain optimal blood pressure control.
4. Continue to provide supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and mechanical ventilation as needed.
5. Consider additional diagnostic testing, such as echocardiography, to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out other potential complications.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust replacement therapy as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
7. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a cardiologist or infectious disease specialist, to further evaluate the patient's condition and develop a comprehensive treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. 

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including an echocardiogram which revealed a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with sparing of the apex, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) which showed numerous pulmonary nodules but no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has also tested positive for Staph aureus bacteremia. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.8°F, heart rate 98 bpm, blood pressure 108/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid intake of 3,682 mL, with a balance of -468 mL. The patient's blood products include 4,150 mL of total output, with 1,250 mL of urine output. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an anxious and diaphoretic individual with a normal cardiovascular examination, diminished breath sounds, and soft and non-tender abdomen. The patient's neurologic examination shows a confused individual with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) not specified, and a 4+ b/l LE weakness greater in distal muscle groups. 

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 3.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 37 K/uL, and a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels include a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 2.2 mg/dL. 

The patient's diagnosis includes fever, electrolyte and fluid disorder, gastrointestinal bleed, tachycardia, hypophosphatemia, and cirrhosis of the liver. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's bacteremia.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachypnea and diminished breath sounds.
3. Cardiac complications due to the patient's dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed due to the patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
5. Electrolyte imbalance due to the patient's fluid disorder and hypophosphatemia.
6. Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
7. Renal failure due to the patient's hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalance.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that the patient receive aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy to treat the bacteremia. The patient should also receive respiratory support and cardiovascular monitoring to prevent cardiac complications. The patient's electrolyte imbalance should be corrected, and the patient should receive nutrition and glycemic control to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and sepsis. The patient has a fever of 101.8°F (38.8°C) and tachycardia, with no localizing source of infection. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 3.0 K/uL, and his platelet count is 37 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) is 9.6 g/dL, and his hematocrit (Hct) is 22.8%. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is not well nourished, anxious, and diaphoretic. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 108/58 mmHg. His respiratory examination shows diminished breath sounds. His abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate, with a value of 1.1 mmol/L. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL, and a phosphorus level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes multiple previous admissions for UGIB, and he has a history of mild pancytopenia. The patient is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiac dysfunction.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and ongoing bleeding may lead to further complications, including hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of ethanol cirrhosis and ongoing liver dysfunction may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of mild pancytopenia and ongoing liver dysfunction may lead to neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and peripheral neuropathy.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's positive blood cultures and ongoing sepsis may lead to further complications, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septic shock.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: Monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and treat with antibiotics and fluids as necessary.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Monitor the patient's bleeding status, including hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and treat with blood transfusions and endoscopy as necessary.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Monitor the patient's mental status and treat with lactulose and other medications as necessary.
4. Neurological complications: Monitor the patient's neurological status and treat with anticonvulsants and other medications as necessary.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and treat with electrolyte supplements and other medications as necessary.
6. Infection-related complications: Monitor the patient's infection status and treat with antibiotics and other medications as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, who was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and persistent fever and tachycardia of unclear etiology. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and has multiple pulmonary nodules on CT scan. The patient is receiving antibiotics, and has been started on Nadolol for beta-blocker withdrawal. The patient is also being treated for upper GI bleed, ethanol cirrhosis, and neuropathy. The patient has hyponatremia and is being volume-challenged.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia could be indicative of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia could lead to bacterial endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's pulmonary nodules on CT scan could be indicative of a pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's ongoing bleeding could lead to further complications, such as hemorrhagic shock or aspiration pneumonia.
5. Ethanol Cirrhosis: The patient's history of ethanol cirrhosis could lead to further complications, such as liver failure or portal hypertension.
6. Neuropathy: The patient's neuropathy could lead to further complications, such as weakness, numbness, or tingling in the extremities.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could lead to further complications, such as seizures, coma, or even death if left untreated.
8. Infection: The patient's fever and tachycardia could be indicative of an underlying infection, which could spread to other parts of the body and cause further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for bacteremia and consider adding anticoagulation therapy to prevent further embolization.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and consider transferring to a higher level of care if necessary.
3. Consider performing a pulmonary embolism protocol to rule out pulmonary embolism.
4. Continue treatment for upper GI bleed and consider endoscopy or surgery if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider liver transplant if necessary.
6. Consider performing an electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS) to further evaluate the patient's neuropathy.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider volume challenges if necessary.
8. Consider restarting celexa/seroquel for depression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Echo: dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with sparing of the
   apex. Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
   - CTA done as Echo raised suspicion of PE: no PE although limited by
   motion. Numerous pulmonary nodules.
   - Found to have 2/2 bottles Staph aureus bacteremia; T max 101.8
   overnight, blood cultures drawn again.
   - Start Nadolol tomorrow (unable to initiate today due to low-normal
   BPs).

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis, multiple previous admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and esophagitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with fever, tachycardia, and persistent tachycardia of unclear etiology. His laboratory results show mild pancytopenia, and his WBC count is off baseline. He has been treated with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia and is awaiting results of HIV and EBV serologies.

The patient's medical history includes etoh cirrhosis, multiple previous admissions for UGIB, and esophagitis. He has a history of mild pancytopenia in the past, but most recent counts are off baseline.

The patient's current medications include nadolol, pantoprazole, carafate, and sucralate. He has been treated with antibiotics for suspected infection, and his blood cultures are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure of 108/58 mmHg, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. He has a right radial pulse, left radial pulse, right DP pulse, and left DP pulse. His extremities are soft and non-tender, with no distension or fluctuance.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and off-baseline WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Neutropenia: The patient's WBC count is off baseline, and he has been treated with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB and is currently receiving treatment for suspected bleeding.
4. Etoh cirrhosis: The patient has a history of etoh cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as liver disease, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
6. Infection: The patient's off-baseline WBC count and fever suggest the possibility of infection.
7. Hypovolemia: The patient's blood pressure is 108/58 mmHg, which may suggest hypovolemia.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, which may suggest respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected infection.
2. Monitor the patient's WBC count and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Consider imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, to evaluate for pneumonia or other complications.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent hypovolemia.
5. Consider invasive mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory failure worsens.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent complications.
7. Consider a neurology consultation if the patient's weakness persists or worsens."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o etoh cirrhosis with multiple previous
   admissions for UGIB [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear's, and esophagitis now
   represents with hematemsis [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], but with persistent
   tachycardia and fever of unclear etiology.
   .
   # Fever: No localizing source at this time.  Patient has a h/o mild
   pancytopenia in past, but most recent counts are off baseline.  This
   could suggest sequestration [**2-23**] to liver disease, acute viral
   infection, or malignancy.  Less likely would be medication effect.
   Un-evaluated sources include CNS infection, sinusitis, or prostatitis.
   - Cover with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia
 not neutropenic,
   but was septic and now has [**2-23**] Bld Cx pos for MRSA
   - Check HIV, EBV serologies - pending
   - F/u cultures
   - Trend WBC count - improving
   - TTE showed RV dysfunction and pulm HTN, will get TEE to look for
   vegetations as fever continues
   - continue to trend lactate
 stable at 2.2
   .
   # Tachycardia: Differential includes sepsis, PE, etoh withdrawal,
   hyperthyroid, fever, beri-beri, pain, anxiety and less likely
   GIB/hypovolemia.  Had been on beta-blocker as outpatient so would
   consider beta-blocker withdrawal as well.
   - 5mg IV diazepam [**Hospital1 **]
   - q3H CIWA with ativan
 not [**Doctor Last Name 93**]
   - trend HCT - improving
   - continue carafate
   - TSH - nl
   - CTA chest
 no PE, but small pulm nodules seen
   - follow UOP which currently is at goal.
   - Restarted nadolol
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed: [**2-23**] to severe erosive esophagitis
   - Continue carafate, PPI
   - HCT stable and improving
   - Active type and screen
   .
   # Etoh Cirrhosis: restart nadolol.  10mg IV diazepam given in ED.
   Continue lactulose.
   - CIWA scale with ativan given liver disease.
   - trend LFT's - stable
   .
   # Weakness: Effecting distal muscle groups more than proximal
   suggesting neuropathy.  Check B12, TSH, and continue folate/thiamine.
   - consider EMG/NCS and neuro consult if worsens
 appears to be
   improving
   - CK not elevated
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Unlikely hypovolemic.  Resolved
   .
   # Depression: Restart celexa/seroquel
   .
   # FEN: Clears, IVF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o etoh cirrhosis with multiple previous
   admissions for UGIB [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear's, and esophagitis now
   represents with hematemsis [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], but with persistent
   tachycardia and fever of unclear etiology.
   .
   # Fever: No localizing source at this time.  Patient has a h/o mild
   pancytopenia in past, but most recent counts are off baseline.  This
   could suggest sequestration [**2-23**] to liver disease, acute viral
   infection, or malignancy.  Less likely would be medication effect.
   Un-evaluated sources include CNS infection, sinusitis, or prostatitis.
   - Cover with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia
 not neutropenic,
   but was septic and now has [**2-23**] Bld Cx pos for MRSA
   - Check HIV, EBV serologies - pending
   - F/u cultures
   - Trend WBC count - improving
   - TTE showed RV dysfunction and pulm HTN, will get TEE to look for
   vegetations as fever continues
   - continue to trend lactate
 stable at 2.2
   .
   # Tachycardia: Differential includes sepsis, PE, etoh withdrawal,
   hyperthyroid, fever, beri-beri, pain, anxiety and less likely
   GIB/hypovolemia.  Had been on beta-blocker as outpatient so would
   consider beta-blocker withdrawal as well.
   - 5mg IV diazepam [**Hospital1 **]
   - q3H CIWA with ativan
 not [**Doctor Last Name 93**]
   - trend HCT - improving
   - continue carafate
   - TSH - nl
   - CTA chest
 no PE, but small pulm nodules seen
   - follow UOP which currently is at goal.
   - Restarted nadolol
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed: [**2-23**] to severe erosive esophagitis
   - Continue carafate, PPI
   - HCT stable and improving
   - Active type and screen
   .
   # Etoh Cirrhosis: restart nadolol.  10mg IV diazepam given in ED.
   Continue lactulose.
   - CIWA scale with ativan given liver disease.
   - trend LFT's - stable
   .
   # Weakness: Effecting distal muscle groups more than proximal
   suggesting neuropathy.  Check B12, TSH, and continue folate/thiamine.
   - consider EMG/NCS and neuro consult if worsens
 appears to be
   improving
   - CK not elevated
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Unlikely hypovolemic.  Resolved
   .
   # Depression: Restart celexa/seroquel
   .
   # FEN: Clears, IVF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis, multiple previous admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and esophagitis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, suspected neutropenia, and RV dysfunction with pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/58 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show mild pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 3.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 37 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 52 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 92 IU/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for etoh cirrhosis, UGIB, and esophagitis. The patient has a history of mild pancytopenia, which could suggest sequestration, liver disease, acute viral infection, or malignancy.

The patient is being treated with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia, and the patient's WBC count is trending upward. The patient's lactate level is stable at 2.2 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, with normal lung sounds and a soft, non-tender abdomen. The patient's extremities show erythema and edema on the right upper extremity, which is resolving.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia could be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death if left untreated.
2. RV dysfunction: The patient's RV dysfunction with pulmonary hypertension could lead to right heart failure and death if left untreated.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's suspected neutropenia could increase the risk of infection and sepsis.
4. Liver disease: The patient's etoh cirrhosis could lead to liver failure and death if left untreated.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB could lead to re-bleeding and death if left untreated.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Coverage with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia.
2. Trending WBC count.
3. TTE and TEE to evaluate RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Continue lactate monitoring.
5. Restart nadolol.
6. Continue carafate and PPI for UGIB.
7. Restart celexa/seroquel for depression.
8. Continue folate/thiamine for neuropathy.
9. Consider EMG/NCS and neuro consult if neuropathy worsens.
10. Place PICC line when afebrile.

The patient's disposition is pending, and the patient is currently receiving ICU care."
