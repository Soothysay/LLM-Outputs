   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, toxins. Acute hearing loss makes viral etiology
   or intracranial microvascular event more likely.
   - Empiric treatment for meningitis in ED (received ctx, vanc,
   acyclovir, steroids on [**4-17**]); will stop antibacterials but continue
   acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending CSF HSV
   PCR results
   - LP performed in ED; results unconcerning for infection or
   inflammation; follow culture
   - Head CT: no acute process
   - Reassess mental status when no longer sedated
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking
   - Obtain brain MRI with contrast when renal function improved
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2.
   - Check K q6h until remains normal X 24 hours
   - Treat ARF as below
   .
   # TROPONIN LEAK: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but more
   likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST depressions
   when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, then decreased to
   0.92 by [**4-18**] morning.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight; will
   discontinue (and restart SCH for prophylaxis) after repeat cardiac labs
   this afternoon show continued decline in enzymes
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission
   - IVF (bolus to maintain BP > 120 systolic, UOP > 50 cc/hr); urine
   lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN 51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Repeat BUN/Cr in afternoon, follow-up urine sediment
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.
   - LP as above, follow up HSV PCR
   - Blood cx, CSF cx, sputum cx, urine cx (though UA benign)
   - CXR: follow up final read
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis; continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for
   possible community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk
   factors for MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course
   - Foilow up urine legionella
   .
   # TACHYPNEA. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in setting of
   agitation/change in mental status. Pt now on PSV 5/5 FiO2 50%.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation this morning
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - Follow up TSH
   - MRI with contrast when possible
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving
   - IV fluids
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck this afternoon or
   tomorrow morning.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: On heparin drip for possible ACS, pneumoboots; PPI
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Son, [**Name (NI) 2476**] [**Name (NI) 14418**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14419**]
   # Code: Presumed full per initial discussion with family, unable to
   discuss with patient.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, toxins. Acute hearing loss makes viral etiology
   or intracranial microvascular event more likely.
   - Empiric treatment for meningitis in ED (received ctx, vanc,
   acyclovir, steroids on [**4-17**]); will stop antibacterials but continue
   acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending CSF HSV
   PCR results
   - LP performed in ED; results unconcerning for infection or
   inflammation; follow culture
   - Head CT: no acute process
   - Reassess mental status when no longer sedated
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking
   - Obtain brain MRI with contrast when renal function improved
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2.
   - Check K q6h until remains normal X 24 hours
   - Treat ARF as below
   .
   # TROPONIN LEAK: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but more
   likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST depressions
   when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, then decreased to
   0.92 by [**4-18**] morning.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight; will
   discontinue (and restart SCH for prophylaxis) after repeat cardiac labs
   this afternoon show continued decline in enzymes
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission
   - IVF (bolus to maintain BP > 120 systolic, UOP > 50 cc/hr); urine
   lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN 51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Repeat BUN/Cr in afternoon, follow-up urine sediment
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.
   - LP as above, follow up HSV PCR
   - Blood cx, CSF cx, sputum cx, urine cx (though UA benign)
   - CXR: follow up final read
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis; continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for
   possible community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk
   factors for MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course
   - Foilow up urine legionella
   .
   # TACHYPNEA. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in setting of
   agitation/change in mental status. Pt now on PSV 5/5 FiO2 50%.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation this morning
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - Follow up TSH
   - MRI with contrast when possible
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving
   - IV fluids
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck this afternoon or
   tomorrow morning.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. **Sepsis**: The patient's febrile response, tachypnea, and confusion are indicative of sepsis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, which further supports the diagnosis of sepsis.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.3, indicating AKI. The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels are also concerning, suggesting possible prerenal or postrenal AKI.
3. **Troponin Leak**: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, suggesting possible myocardial injury. The patient's EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes support this diagnosis.
4. **Hyperkalemia**: The patient's potassium level has increased to 6.7, which is concerning. The patient has received insulin, bicarbonate, and calcium to treat hyperkalemia.
5. **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be a concern in the setting of AKI and sepsis.
6. **Fever**: The patient's fever is not well-controlled, and the source is unclear. The patient has received empiric antibiotics and antivirals, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.
7. **Tachypnea**: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, which may be related to sepsis, AKI, or other underlying conditions.
8. **Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss**: The patient's sudden hearing loss is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
9. **Hypothyroidism**: The patient's TSH level is not reported, but it may be relevant to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.
10. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The patient's electrolyte levels are concerning, with hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. Further monitoring and treatment are needed to correct these imbalances.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and provide appropriate treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation pending MRI as discussed below
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not show a
   pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending CSF HSV
   PCR results
   - check cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking
   - Obtain brain MRI with contrast when renal function improved
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2.
   - Check K q6h until remains normal X 24 hours
   - Treat ARF as below
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, then
   decreased to 0.92 by [**4-18**] morning.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight; will
   discontinue (and restart SCH for prophylaxis) after repeat cardiac labs
   this afternoon show continued decline in enzymes
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE today
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission
   - IVF (bolus to maintain BP > 120 systolic, UOP > 50 cc/hr); urine
   lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN 51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Repeat BUN/Cr in afternoon, follow-up urine sediment
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Blood cx, CSF cx,
   - sputum cx
   - urine cx (though UA benign)
   - F/U  CXR: follow up final read
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis;
   - Continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for possible
   community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk factors for
   MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course. Dose adjust
   based on renal function
   - Follow up urine legionella
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - Follow up TSH
   - MRI with contrast when possible
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving
   - IV fluids
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck this afternoon or
   tomorrow morning.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: On heparin drip for possible ACS, pneumoboots; PPI
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Son, [**Name (NI) 2476**] [**Name (NI) 14418**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14419**]

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is intubated and on PSV with FiO2 50%, which may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis/Infection: The patient has a fever, confusion, and altered mental status, which may indicate an underlying infection. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, and urinary tract infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they have a history of chronic kidney disease. The AKI may be caused by prerenal, renal, or postrenal factors.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate acute coronary syndrome or cardiac injury. The patient is also receiving heparin and statins, which may increase the risk of bleeding or cardiac complications.
6. Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss: The patient has sudden hearing loss, which may be caused by viral or bacterial infections, microvascular events, or other etiologies.
7. Meningitis/Encephalitis: The patient has a fever, headache, and altered mental status, which may indicate meningitis or encephalitis.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving antihypertensive medications.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and is receiving high-dose statins.
10. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is receiving a proton pump inhibitor.
11. Agitation/Discomfort: The patient is experiencing agitation and discomfort, which may be caused by pain, anxiety, or other factors.
12. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, with an increased risk of dehydration or fluid overload.

These potential complications require close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate their effects on the patient's condition."

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%. Pt unable to tolerate trial of pressure support,
   requiring increased sedation. Remains intubated in setting of
   agitation; may be difficult to extubated for this reason.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Trial of Precedex
   - Consider Haldol PRN for agitation
   - Attempt to wean from other sedation
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute
   hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious etiology.
   Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH,
   abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central
   process.
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - F/U brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   - Continue hydrocortisone
   - Check T3/T4 given low TSH (likely related to panhypopituitarism)
   - Check IGF level
   - F/U endocrine recs
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight (continue for
   48 hours)
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Stop levofloxacin, acyclovir given clear CXR, lack of compelling
   evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine, Creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency given low cortisol. UOP
   has been declining.
   - IV fluids (will bolus this AM for recent low UOP)
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease.
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - TSH low; will start thyroxine.
   - Follow-up MRI
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with confusion, inability to hear, and fever. He was intubated for agitation and tachypnea and admitted to the MICU. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and CKD. He has been experiencing respiratory distress, change in mental status, elevated troponin, fever, acute kidney injury, hypornatremia, hyperkalemia, and sudden hearing loss.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is intubated. He may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Change in Mental Status: The patient's confusion and agitation may be due to sepsis, infection, or acute intracranial process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which may indicate acute ischemia or demand in the setting of infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Fever: The patient's fever may be due to infection, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he may require continued IVF and close monitoring of his kidney function.
6. Hypornatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be due to dehydration or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be due to acute on chronic kidney disease. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
8. Sudden Hearing Loss: The patient's sudden hearing loss may be due to viral cochleitis, microvascular events, or other etiologies. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Further evaluate the patient's mental status and consider imaging studies to rule out acute intracranial process.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's troponin levels and consider stress testing to determine the cause of the elevated levels.
4. Continue to evaluate the patient's fever and consider further imaging studies to determine the source.
5. Continue IVF and close monitoring of the patient's kidney function.
6. Replete the patient's electrolytes and monitor his sodium and potassium levels.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's sudden hearing loss, including audiometric testing and imaging studies.
8. Consider starting thyroxine therapy given the patient's low TSH levels."

   [**4-18**] CXR - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
    change. The lung volumes have minimally decreased. There is no
   evidence of pleural effusion. However, subtle predominantly basal
   opacities are seen in almost unchanged manner. These opacities could
   reflect both atelectasis and pneumonia. No evidence of newly appeared
   parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no
   pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Unchanged
   position of the endotracheal tube, the tip projects 1.7 cm above the
   carina and could be retracted by 1-2 cm.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%. Pt unable to tolerate trial of pressure support,
   requiring increased sedation.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.
   - pt with abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test: continue hydrocortisone
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - Brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine, Creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Continue empiric acyclovir (day 1
 [**4-17**]) as above for possible
   encephalitis
   - Continue levofloxacin (day 1
 [**4-17**]) empirically for possible
   community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk factors for
   MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - TSH low; will start thyroxine.
   - Follow-up MRI
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency given low cortisol
   - IV fluids
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: On heparin drip for possible ACS, pneumoboots; PPI
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Son, [**Name (NI) 2476**] [**Name (NI) 14418**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14419**]
   # Code: Presumed full per initial discussion with family, unable to
   discuss with patient.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   requiring increased sedation.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.
   - pt with abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test: continue hydrocortisone
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - Brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated

   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR

   community-acquired PNA given concerning CXR (no known risk factors for
   MRSA); course to be determined pending clinical course.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - TSH low; will start thyroxine.
   - Follow-up MRI

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease who presented to the emergency department with confusion, inability to hear, and fever. He was intubated for agitation and tachypnea and admitted to the MICU. The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and requires pressure support ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. He was unable to tolerate a trial of pressure support and required increased sedation.
2. Change in mental status: The patient is confused, with a headache and complaining of inability to hear. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, acute intracranial process, seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, and toxins.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes, which were likely secondary to acute on chronic kidney disease. He received insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, and kayexalate, and his potassium level has normalized.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level was elevated to 1.08, which is unclear whether it is secondary to new acute ischemia or demand in the setting of an acute infection. He received heparin and has been prescribed high-dose statin and aspirin.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has a mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior that normalized to baseline. He is receiving IV fluids and renally dosed medications.
6. Fever and possible pneumonia: The patient has a fever and is being treated empirically for possible community-acquired pneumonia. He has a concerning CXR, but his urine legionella and urine cx are negative.
7. Sudden hearing loss: The patient has sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which is usually unilateral and resolves in <72 hours. The etiology is usually uncertain, but postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis, microvascular events, and autoimmune disorders.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, likely secondary to an appropriate ADH response to dehydration. He is receiving IV fluids and will have his electrolytes trended.
9. Elevated coags/LFTs: The patient's coagulation studies and liver function tests are elevated, but the etiology is unclear.
10. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is being treated with medications to control it.
11. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has high cholesterol and is being treated with a high-dose statin.
12. GERD: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease and is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor.
13. Agitation/discomfort: The patient is experiencing agitation and discomfort, and is receiving morphine as needed for pain.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and confusion could be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and CXR findings could indicate pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which could lead to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin level could indicate cardiac ischemia, which could lead to myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol level could indicate adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium level could lead to seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest.
8. Sudden hearing loss: The patient's sudden sensorineural hearing loss could be permanent if not treated promptly and effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to treat the patient's respiratory distress with pressure support ventilation and FiO2 of 50%.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's hyperkalemia with insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, and kayexalate.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust IV fluids and medications as needed.
6. Continue to treat the patient's fever and possible pneumonia with empiric antibiotics.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust IV fluids and medications as needed.
8. Consider starting the patient on a statin and aspirin for cardiac protection.
9. Consider starting the patient on a proton pump inhibitor for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. Consider starting the patient on a thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism.
11. Consider starting the patient on a medication to treat sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
12. Monitor the patient's audiometric eval when possible and adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.
   Acute hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious
   etiology. Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

1. The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and CKD who presented to the emergency department with confusion, headache, and complaints of inability to hear.
2. The patient was intubated for agitation and tachypnea and admitted to the MICU.
3. The patient's respiratory status is stable on PSV with FiO2 50%, but he is unable to tolerate a trial of pressure support and requires increased sedation.
4. The patient has a change in mental status, including confusion, headache, and deafness, which is attributed to sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process, seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, or toxins.
5. The patient has elevated troponin levels, which are unclear whether secondary to new acute ischemia or demand in the setting of an acute infection.
6. The patient has a fever, which is unclear in origin, but may be related to meningitis, LUL PNA, viral infection, endocarditis, or abdominal process.
7. The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with mildly elevated creatinine levels, which is suspected to be due to prerenal azotemia or ATN in the setting of possible sepsis.
8. The patient has hypocalcemia, which is likely secondary to acute on chronic kidney disease.
9. The patient has sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which is usually unilateral and resolves within 72 hours.
10. The patient has elevated coagulation factors and liver function tests, which are unclear in etiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure due to increased sedation and pressure support.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to the unclear origin of the patient's fever.
3. Acute kidney injury progressing to chronic kidney disease.
4. Cardiac complications due to elevated troponin levels and possible acute ischemia.
5. Neurological complications due to the patient's change in mental status and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
6. Infections, such as meningitis or endocarditis, which may worsen the patient's condition.
7. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
8. Bleeding complications due to the patient's elevated coagulation factors.

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust sedation and pressure support as needed.
2. Perform a thorough infectious work-up, including blood and CSF cultures, to determine the origin of the patient's fever.
3. Manage the patient's acute kidney injury with IVF and repletion of electrolytes.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Perform a thorough neurological evaluation to determine the cause of the patient's change in mental status and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed to prevent complications.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist or cardiologist to help manage the patient's complex medical condition."

   insufficiency (not secondary/panhypopit) given the hypotension and
   hyperkalemia which are not seen in secondary insufficiency. Therefore,
   no need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing. Add on cortisol to
   admission labs (pre-steroids). Consider CT of adrenals to check for

   MRI head
 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (found to have
   multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from arrhythmia), electrolyte
   imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not
   show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may
   be more consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious
   etiology including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis/TIA could
   also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt
   received high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis
   treatment, his decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that
   rather than a pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim
   test is somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.
   - Endocrine following; appreciate recs.
   - Start to taper hydrocort today if clinically stable (go to 25 IV
   q8h).
   - No need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing.
   - Consider CT of adrenals to check for atrophied glands
   - Neuro following for stroke; believes triggering event may have been
   paroxysmal arrhythmia that led to multiple emboli to brain. See below
   for recs.
   - Antibiotics/acyclovir stopped yesterday (HSV PCR negative in CSF)
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   .
   # STROKE. MR head final read: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   - Neuro following; appreciate recs.
   - Consider MRA (or CTA) of head/neck
 will confirm purpose of this
   study with neuro
   - HbA1c and lipid panel pending
   - Plan to stop heparin gtt today
   - F/U telemetry for signs of A-fib (if develops, will need
   anticoagulation)
   - Maintain euglycemia/euthermic
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: likely demand in the setting of an acute
   infection.  Had ST depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins
   elevated to 1.08, now normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness but normal LP and
   HSV PCR, possible LUL PNA given CXR findings, viral infection (URI),
   endocarditis but negative blood cultures and TTE, abdominal process (eg
   diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Urine cx negative.
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Levofloxacin stopped [**4-19**], acyclovir stopped [**4-19**] given lack of
   compelling evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine; creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   - D/C foley
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency. Resolved.
   - IV fluids as needed for UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease. Resolved.
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Resolved. Likely in setting of confusion, acute
   stroke.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2196-4-19**] 11:17 AM
   received from EW at 1421
   - MR head final read: Small acute infarcts in the left occipital and
   right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should be considered.
   - Stroke team consulted; recs: MRA (or CTA) of head/neck; check HbA1c
   and lipid panel; continue heparin gtt; F/U telemetry for signs of A-fib
   (if develops, will need anticoagulation); keep euglycemia/euthermic
   - EEG pending
   - Endocrine consulted; recs: Suspect that this is PRIMARY adrenal
   insufficiency (not secondary/panhypopit) given the hypotension and
   hyperkalemia which are not seen in secondary insufficiency. Therefore,
   no need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing. Add on cortisol to
   admission labs (pre-steroids). Consider CT of adrenals to check for
   atrophied glands. Continue hydrocort 50 IV q8h while in ICU, start to
   taper [**4-20**] if clinicall stable (go to 25 IV q8h).

   MRI head
 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (found to have
   multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from arrhythmia), electrolyte
   imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not
   show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may
   be more consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious
   etiology including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis/TIA could
   also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt
   received high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis
   treatment, his decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that
   rather than a pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim
   test is somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.
   - Endocrine following; appreciate recs.
   - Start to taper hydrocort today if clinically stable (go to 25 IV
   q8h).
   - No need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing.
   - Consider CT of adrenals to check for atrophied glands
   - Neuro following for stroke; believes triggering event may have been
   paroxysmal arrhythmia that led to multiple emboli to brain. See below

   - Maintain euglycemia/euthermic
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: likely demand in the setting of an acute
   infection.  Had ST depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins
   elevated to 1.08, now normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.

   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when

   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness but normal LP and
   HSV PCR, possible LUL PNA given CXR findings, viral infection (URI),
   endocarditis but negative blood cultures and TTE, abdominal process (eg
   diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Urine cx negative.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension, hyperkalemia, and abnormal cortisol levels suggest adrenal insufficiency. The patient is already receiving hydrocortisone and the plan is to taper the dose if clinically stable.
2. Stroke: The patient has had a multi-embolic stroke, and the MRI head final read suggests small acute infarcts in the left occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should be considered.
3. Infection: The patient's fever, confusion, and headache could be related to an infection, and the patient has been treated with antibiotics and antivirals. However, the HSV PCR in CSF was negative, and the urine and blood cultures are pending.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for respiratory distress and tachypnea, and was successfully extubated on [**4-19**]. The patient may still be at risk for respiratory failure, especially if they develop pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and ST depressions on EKG suggest cardiac injury or inflammation. The patient is receiving heparin and statins, and will need further evaluation and treatment for cardiac complications.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.3, and the urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN 51% suggest a component of prerenal AKI. The patient will need close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has had episodes of hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia, which may be related to their underlying medical conditions and treatments.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of GERD and is receiving a proton pump inhibitor. They may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient has had a stroke and may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
10. Sepsis: The patient's fever, confusion, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical team should continue to closely monitor their condition and adjust their treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72.6 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation and has been weaned off of vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/39 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on 50% FiO2. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 28 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome may progress to respiratory failure, which could require further interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and a higher risk of mortality.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which could worsen if not addressed.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and decreased movement may indicate underlying neurological damage, which could worsen if not addressed.
6. Infection: The patient's presence of a central line and urinary catheter increases the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and further complications.
7. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated international normalized ratio (INR) may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to receive enteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition and further compromise their immune function."

 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%. Pt unable to tolerate trial of pressure support,
   requiring increased sedation. Remains intubated in setting of
   agitation; may be difficult to extubated for this reason.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Trial of Precedex
   - Consider Haldol PRN for agitation
   - Attempt to wean from other sedation
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute
   hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious etiology.
   Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH,
   abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central
   process.
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - F/U brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   - Continue hydrocortisone
   - Check T3/T4 given low TSH (likely related to panhypopituitarism)
   - Check IGF level
   - F/U endocrine recs
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight (continue for
   48 hours)
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Stop levofloxacin, acyclovir given clear CXR, lack of compelling
   evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine, Creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency given low cortisol. UOP
   has been declining.
   - IV fluids (will bolus this AM for recent low UOP)
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease.
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - TSH low; will start thyroxine.
   - Follow-up MRI
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.
   .
   # Agitation/discomfort. Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. Pt intubated for tachypnea/airway protection in
   setting of agitation/change in mental status/tachypnea. Pt now on PSV
   [**5-18**] FiO2 50%. Pt unable to tolerate trial of pressure support,
   requiring increased sedation. Remains intubated in setting of
   agitation; may be difficult to extubated for this reason.
   - HOB precautions, VAP precautions.
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Trial of Precedex
   - Consider Haldol PRN for agitation
   - Attempt to wean from other sedation
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process
   (stroke/bleed), seizure, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia,
   electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in
   ED does not show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute
   hearing loss may be more consistent with viral infectious etiology.
   Non-infectious etiology including vasculitis or microvascular
   thrombosis could also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH,
   abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central
   process.
   - hold antibiotics for now
   - continue acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis pending negative
   CSF HSV PCR results or normal MRI
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   - F/U brain MRI with contrast, read pending
   - Continue hydrocortisone
   - Check T3/T4 given low TSH (likely related to panhypopituitarism)
   - Check IGF level
   - F/U endocrine recs
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: unclear if secondary to new acute ischemia, but
   more likely demand in the setting of an acute infection.  Had ST
   depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins elevated to 1.08, now
   normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs overnight (continue for
   48 hours)
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness, possible LUL PNA
   given CXR findings, viral infection (URI), endocarditis, abdominal
   process (eg diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine
   legionella negative.  TTE negative for vegetations. Urine cx negative.
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Stop levofloxacin, acyclovir given clear CXR, lack of compelling
   evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine, Creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency given low cortisol. UOP
   has been declining.
   - IV fluids (will bolus this AM for recent low UOP)
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease.
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.
   .
   # SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Pt not yet evaluated due to agitation, but per
   family was c/o hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is
   usually unilateral, usually resolves in <72 hours. Etiology usually
   uncertain; postulated etiologies include viral cochleitis (associated
   with HSV-I, parainfluenza, influenza virus, HIV, MMR, bacterial
   meningitis, M. pneumonia, Lyme, MTb, syphilis), microvascular events,
   vertebrobasilar CVA / TIA; cerebellar infarction, inner ear hemorrhage,
   autoimmune disorders/vasculitides, ototoxic drugs, neoplasm, head
   injury, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, Paget's, MS, sarcoid,
   hypothyroidism. Typical treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss
   includes 10 days of high dose prednisone (60-80 mg qd), with
   valacyclovir 1 g tid X 7-10 days (though trials supporting these
   treatments are lacking). We will continue acyclovir empirically until
   further evaluation of the pt's hearing is possible, but will not use
   steroids given possibility of infection.
   - Continue acyclovir (day 1 = [**4-17**]) for presumed course 7-10 days unless
   CSF PCR negative for HSV1
   - Audiometric eval when possible, if symptoms persist when patient able
   to be examined
   - TSH low; will start thyroxine.
   - Follow-up MRI
   .
   # Elevated coags/LFTs. Unclear etiology, will recheck tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypertension. Hold home meds for now (lasix, diltiazem, isosorbide
   mononitrate)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. High dose statin as above.
   .
   # GERD. Continue home PPI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of confusion, headache, and inability to hear.

The patient has undergone several significant events in the past 24 hours, including:

1. Invasive ventilation was stopped, and the patient was transitioned to non-invasive ventilation.
2. The patient's stroke team was consulted, and recommendations included an MRA (or CTA) of the head and neck, as well as further laboratory tests, including HbA1c and lipid panels.
3. The patient's endocrine team was consulted, and they suspected primary adrenal insufficiency based on the patient's hypotension and hyperkalemia.
4. The patient's antimicrobials were stopped, and he was started on acyclovir for possible HSV-1 encephalitis.
5. The patient's respiratory support was adjusted, and he was placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a FiO2 of 50%.
6. The patient's mental status continued to deteriorate, with ongoing agitation, confusion, and altered mental status.
7. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, which were attributed to an acute infection rather than new acute ischemia.
8. The patient's creatinine level was elevated, and he was found to have acute kidney injury (AKI).
9. The patient's potassium level was elevated, and he was treated with insulin, dextrose, bicarbonate, calcium, and kayexalate.
10. The patient's sudden hearing loss was noted, and he was started on acyclovir empirically until further evaluation was possible.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Progression of acute kidney injury (AKI) and potential need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection.
4. Worsening of mental status and potential need for sedation or intubation.
5. Continued elevation of troponin levels and potential need for further cardiac workup.
6. Development of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to underlying cardiac disease.
7. Continued hyperkalemia and potential need for further treatment.
8. Development of electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypophosphatemia.
9. Continued elevation of creatinine levels and potential need for further nephrology consultation.
10. Development of other complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing medical issues, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."

 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection (most likely), acute intracranial process (found to
   have multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, adrenal
   insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not show a pattern
   typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may be more
   consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious etiology
   including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis could also cause acute
   hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test suspect
   panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt received
   high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis treatment, his
   decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that rather than a
   pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test is
   somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   received from EW at 1421
   - MR head final read: Small acute infarcts in the left occipital and
   right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should be considered.
   - Stroke team consulted; recs: MRA (or CTA) of head/neck; check HbA1c
   and lipid panel; continue heparin gtt; F/U telemetry for signs of A-fib
   (if develops, will need anticoagulation); keep euglycemia/euthermic
   - EEG pending
   - Endocrine consulted; recs: Suspect that this is PRIMARY adrenal
   insufficiency (not secondary/panhypopit) given the hypotension and
   hyperkalemia which are not seen in secondary insufficiency. Therefore,
   no need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing. Add on cortisol to
   admission labs (pre-steroids). Consider CT of adrenals to check for
   atrophied glands. Continue hydrocort 50 IV q8h while in ICU, start to
   taper [**4-20**] if clinicall stable (go to 25 IV q8h).

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease who presented to the emergency department with confusion, headache, and inability to hear. He was intubated for agitation and tachypnea and admitted to the MICU.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Acute stroke with small infarcts in the left occipital and right posterior temporal lobes, likely due to embolic etiology.
2. Primary adrenal insufficiency, suspected based on low cortisol levels and hyperkalemia.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
4. Hypertension, which is being managed with medication hold.
5. Hyperlipidemia, which is being treated with high-dose statin.
6. GERD, which is being managed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
7. Respiratory distress, which has resolved with extubation.
8. Elevated coagulation studies and liver function tests (LFTs), which are pending further evaluation.
9. Sudden hearing loss, which has resolved.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including:

1. Hydrocortisone 50 IV q8h for adrenal insufficiency.
2. Heparin drip for embolic stroke prophylaxis.
3. Antibiotics and antiviral medications have been stopped due to lack of compelling evidence for infectious process.
4. IVF boluses as needed for AKI.
5. Renally dosed medications to avoid nephrotoxins.
6. Morphine for pain management.
7. PPI for GERD.

The patient's current condition is stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU. Further evaluation and management are needed to address his various medical complications."

   MRI head
 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (found to have
   multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from arrhythmia), electrolyte
   imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not
   show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may
   be more consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious
   etiology including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis/TIA could
   also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt
   received high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis
   treatment, his decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that
   rather than a pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim
   test is somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.
   - Endocrine following; appreciate recs.
   - Continue hydrocort 50 IV q8h while in ICU, start to taper [**4-20**] if
   clinicall stable (go to 25 IV q8h).
   - No need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing.
   - Consider CT of adrenals to check for atrophied glands
   - Neuro following for stroke; believes triggering event may have been
   paroxysmal arrhythmia that led to multiple emboli to brain. See below
   for recs.
   - Antibiotics/acyclovir stopped yesterday (HSV PCR negative in CSF)
   - Infectious work-up as below (see #FEVER)
   - EEG given UE shaking, read pending
   .
   # STROKE. MR head final read: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   - Neuro following; appreciate recs.
   - MRA (or CTA) of head/neck
   - HbA1c and lipid panel pending
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - F/U telemetry for signs of A-fib (if develops, will need
   anticoagulation)
   - Maintain euglycemia/euthermic
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: likely demand in the setting of an acute
   infection.  Had ST depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins
   elevated to 1.08, now normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness but normal LP and
   HSV PCR, possible LUL PNA given CXR findings, viral infection (URI),
   endocarditis but negative blood cultures and TTE, abdominal process (eg
   diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Urine cx negative.
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Levofloxacin stopped [**4-19**], acyclovir stopped [**4-19**] given lack of
   compelling evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine; creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency.
   - IV fluids as needed for UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to
   acute on chronic kidney disease.
   - Normalized now that pt is at baseline creatinine. Will follow results
   of daily labs.

   MRI head
 There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
   posterior left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
   consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high signal
   on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are at least [**6-25**]
   hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar infarct in the right pons.
   There are multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical,
   periventricular, and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres,
   likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles
   and sulci are normal in size and configuration for age. There is no
   evidence of intracranial blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly
   marginated, fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in
   the midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
   cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins. The
   major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland appears
   normal in size.   IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left
   occipital and right posterior temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should
   be considered.
   Micro: No growth in blood or CSF or urine cultures
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents from
   home today with confusion and complaints of inability to hear, in the
   ED found to be febrile to 100.8, was intubated for agitation and
   tachypnea, admitted to MICU.
   .
   # CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: Pt confused, with headache, complaining of
   inability to hear. DDx of change in mental status includes
   sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process (found to have
   multi-embolic stroke on MRI), seizure, infectious
   meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from arrhythmia), electrolyte
   imbalance, adrenal insufficiency, toxins.  LP performed in ED does not
   show a pattern typical for bacterial infection.  Acute hearing loss may
   be more consistent with viral infectious etiology. Non-infectious
   etiology including vasculitis or microvascular thrombosis/TIA could
   also cause acute hearing loss.  Given low TSH, abnormal [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   suspect panhypopituitarism related to ? central process; however as pt
   received high-dose dexamethasone in ED for empiric meningitis
   treatment, his decreased pituitary axis is likely related to that
   rather than a pre-existing proceess. His low response to the [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim
   test is somewhat surprising though and he may have underlying primary
   (adrenally mediated, not pituitary-mediated) adrenal insufficiency.
   - Endocrine following; appreciate recs.
   - Continue hydrocort 50 IV q8h while in ICU, start to taper [**4-20**] if
   clinicall stable (go to 25 IV q8h).
   - No need to pursue further pituitary fxn testing.
   - Consider CT of adrenals to check for atrophied glands
   - Neuro following for stroke; believes triggering event may have been
   paroxysmal arrhythmia that led to multiple emboli to brain. See below
   for recs.

   - MRA (or CTA) of head/neck
   - HbA1c and lipid panel pending
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - F/U telemetry for signs of A-fib (if develops, will need
   anticoagulation)
   - Maintain euglycemia/euthermic
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: likely demand in the setting of an acute
   infection.  Had ST depressions when agitated and moving. Troponins
   elevated to 1.08, now normalizing. Repeat EKG ~unchanged.
   - cycle enzymes
   - Continue daily EKGs while enzymes remain elevated
   - high dose statin/asa, consider starting low-dose beta blocker when
   pressure permits
   - on heparin gtt without bolus per cards recs
   - will need workup after acute issues improve with stress test
   - TTE shows EF 55-60%, possible inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis but
   otherwise normal
   .
   # FEVER/POSSIBLE PNA. Pt with rectal temp to 100.8 on DOA, spiked to
   100.7 o/n on [**4-17**]-5, b/l UE shaking. Unclear source: ddx includes
   meningitis given confusion and headache and deafness but normal LP and
   HSV PCR, possible LUL PNA given CXR findings, viral infection (URI),
   endocarditis but negative blood cultures and TTE, abdominal process (eg
   diverticulitis). UTI unlikely with negative UA.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Urine cx negative.
   - Follow blood cx, CSF cx
   - sputum cx contaminated
   - Levofloxacin stopped [**4-19**], acyclovir stopped [**4-19**] given lack of
   compelling evidence for infectious process
   .
   # ARF. Acute on chronic, with mildly elevated Cr to 1.3 one year prior
   that normalized to baseline of 1.1. For acute elevation, suspect
   component of prerenal, ?ATN in setting of possible sepsis though not
   objectively hypotensive on admission; urine lytes with FeNa 4% and FeUN
   51%. Neg urine eos, Na 98. Urine sediment benign.
   - Now at baseline creatinine; creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-gault
   is 41.
   - IVF (bolus to maintain UOP > 50 cc/hr)
   - Renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins

   # HYPONATREMIA: likely secondary to appropriate ADH response to
   dehydration, improving; ?adrenal insufficiency.
   - IV fluids as needed for UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Follow-up ACTH/renin
   - trend electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA. Elevated to 6.7 with EKG changes; pt received
   insulin/dextrose, bicarb, calcium, kayexalate X2. Likely secondary to

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with confusion, inability to hear, and tachypnea. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently on invasive ventilation. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and chronic kidney disease.

Recent events:

* Invasive ventilation was stopped at 11:17 AM on [**2196-4-19**].
* The patient was found to have small acute infarcts in the left occipital and right posterior temporal lobes on MRI, with an embolic etiology suspected.
* The patient was started on heparin drip for embolic stroke prophylaxis.
* The patient's TSH level was low, and a low response to the TSH stimulation test was noted, suggesting possible primary adrenal insufficiency.
* The patient's cortisol level was 15.7 (admission lab), and he was started on hydrocortisone 50 IV q8h.
* The patient's blood cultures and CSF cultures are pending.
* The patient's urine legionella and urine cx are negative.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis/infection: The patient's fever and confusion could be indicative of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Stroke: The patient's recent embolic stroke could lead to further neurological deficits or even death.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low TSH level and low response to the TSH stimulation test suggest possible primary adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to adrenal crisis if not treated promptly.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury could progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's recent extubation could lead to respiratory failure if not monitored closely.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension could indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest or other cardiovascular complications.

Recommendations:

* Continue heparin drip for embolic stroke prophylaxis.
* Monitor the patient's blood cultures and CSF cultures for any signs of infection.
* Repeat the TSH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency.
* Monitor the patient's cortisol level and adjust the dosage of hydrocortisone as needed.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the dosage of medications accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the dosage of oxygen therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust the dosage of medications accordingly.
* Consider starting a stress test to evaluate the patient's cardiac function."
