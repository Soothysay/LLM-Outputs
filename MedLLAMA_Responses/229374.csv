You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history of Crohn's Disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for rate control with a diltiazem drip due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after jejunal resection for small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 97 beats per minute (bpm) with an irregular rhythm
* Blood pressure: 156/85 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98% on 3L nasal cannula

The patient is obese and in pain, with a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place. She has a colostomy and jejunal drains, and is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Sodium: 4.0 mEq/L
* Potassium: 32.4%
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Hematocrit: 32.4%

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Small bowel obstruction with jejunostomy tube placement
* Abdominal tenderness and guarding
* Dressings with serosanguinous fluid
* Pedal pulses 2+ and trace edema bilaterally

The patient's medical complications include:

* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Small bowel obstruction
* Hyperglycemia
* Potential for abdominal compartment syndrome
* Risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue diltiazem drip for rate control
* Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
* Monitor drain output and urine output
* Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg
* Continue IV fluids and antibiotics
* Monitor for signs of VTE
* Restart oral medications when able to tolerate
* Restart mesalamine when able to tolerate orally
* Tight glucose control to aid in healing

The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the surgical service for further management."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She is currently in the ICU due to small bowel obstruction (SBO) and jejunal resection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 156/85 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3L NC. Her temperature is 36.1°C (97°F), and her respiratory rate is 18 inspirations per minute.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is being treated with a diltiazem drip to control the heart rate.
2. Small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions, which is being managed with nasogastric suction and bowel rest.
3. Abdominal surgery, including jejunal resection and colostomy, which is being monitored for abdominal compartment syndrome.
4. Hyperglycemia, with a fasting blood sugar of 159 mg/dL, which is likely due to post-operative stress and pain.
5. Crohn's disease, which is being managed with bowel rest and holding of oral medications.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Diltiazem drip for rate control
2. Metoprolol 20 mg IV every 4 hours for heart rate control
3. Morphine PCA for pain control
4. Zofran 8mg IV every 8 hours for nausea and vomiting
5. Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole per surgery for antibiotic coverage

The patient's lab results show:

1. Hemoglobin 4.0 mEq/L
2. Hematocrit 32.4%
3. Magnesium level 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue diltiazem drip for rate control
2. Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
3. Appreciate surgery recommendations
4. Manage pain with morphine PCA
5. Monitor drain output and urine output
6. Maintain mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg
7. Continue IV fluids with LR 20cc/hr
8. Monitor for hyperglycemia and adjust insulin therapy as needed
9. Restart oral medications when able to tolerate them.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to be called out to surgery."

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who was recently readmitted to the ICU following surgical revision of jejunal stricture. She is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with IV diltiazem and metoprolol. The patient is also experiencing pain at the incision site, which is being managed with morphine PCA and the addition of toradol. Her blood sugars are in the 150s, and she is being monitored for impaired glucose tolerance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.7°F, heart rate of 114 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula. She has a history of allergies to tetracycline and dilaudid, and is currently receiving antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of cardiac complications, including stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but her atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent jejunal resection increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent surgical procedure increase her risk of infection, including sepsis and organ failure.
5. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery increase her risk of thromboembolic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's impaired glucose tolerance and history of Crohn's disease increase her risk of nutritional complications, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances."

Summary:

The patient, a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, has been readmitted to the ICU following a surgical revision of jejunal stricture. She is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR) and is complaining of pain at the incision site. The patient has a history of allergies to tetracycline and Dilaudid (Hydromorphone Hcl/Pf), which caused rash and confusion/delirium, respectively.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm (92-115 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/85 mmHg (96-166/102-113 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (10-25 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: AF (Atrial Fibrillation)

The patient has a PICC line, NG tube, and is receiving IV diltiazem, metoprolol, and morphine PCA for pain control. She is also receiving TPN with lipids and has a code status of full code.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications such as stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent jejunal resection may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's history of antibiotics and presence of a PICC line and NG tube may increase the risk of infection.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Renal complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may lead to nutritional complications such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalance.
7. Wound complications: The patient's incision site may be at risk for wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for rate control and management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) following jejunal resection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.8°C, HR: 110 bpm, BP: 105/54 mmHg, RR: 18 breaths/min, SpO2: 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR)
* Fluid balance: Total input: 2,929 mL, total output: 1,635 mL, with a positive balance of 1,294 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device: nasal cannula, SpO2: 95%
* Physical examination: obese female in pain, awake and oriented, with a rapid irregularly irregular heart rate
* Labs: WBC: 12.4, Hct: 32.4, Plt: 454, Cr: 0.5, Glucose: 112, other labs pending

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Abdominal compartment syndrome due to SBO and intestinal obstruction
* Hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss and inadequate resuscitation
* Respiratory failure due to increased respiratory rate and potential for respiratory acidosis
* Cardiac complications due to AFib and RVR, including atrial fibrillation-related stroke and cardiac arrhythmias
* Infection due to SBO and intestinal obstruction, including peritonitis and abscesses
* Malnutrition due to NPO status and potential for prolonged ICU stay
* Hyperglycemia due to stress and pain, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis
* Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue rate control with diltiazem drip and metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
* Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome and appreciate surgery recommendations
* Maintain IVF with LR 20cc/hr and monitor for signs of hypovolemic shock
* Monitor for respiratory failure and potential for respiratory acidosis
* Continue pain control with morphine PCA and Zofran 8mg IV q8h as needed
* Monitor for hyperglycemia and potential for diabetic ketoacidosis
* Restart oral medications, including Mesalamine, when able to tolerate PO
* Consider restarting anticoagulation therapy once the patient's condition stabilizes."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
    She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for rate control and management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) following jejunal resection.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 110 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 105/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: Given the patient's history of SBO and jejunal resection, there is a risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and the risk of developing pneumonia is high, especially given the presence of NG tube and JP drains.
3. Sepsis: The patient has multiple drains and tubes, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk of developing thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Wound complications: The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and is at risk of developing wound complications, including infection and dehiscence.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of pre-diabetes and is at risk of developing hyperglycemia, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.
7. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may be related to blood loss during surgery or underlying medical conditions.
8. Pain management: The patient is at risk of developing pain management complications, including opioid tolerance and withdrawal.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for:

* Abdominal distension and respiratory compromise
* Signs of pneumonia, including fever, cough, and dyspnea
* Sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and hypotension
* Thromboembolic events, including DVT and PE
* Wound complications, including infection and dehiscence
* Hyperglycemia, including blood glucose levels above 180 mg/dL
* Anemia, including signs of fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin
* Pain management, including opioid tolerance and withdrawal

The patient's care plan should include:

* Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Aggressive management of pain and discomfort
* Prophylactic antibiotics for SBO and wound infections
* Anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation
* Tight glucose control to prevent hyperglycemia
* Nutritional support, including TPN and lipids
* Prophylactic measures for DVT and PE, including pneumoboots and anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a history of atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient is currently in the ICU due to the SBO and is receiving IV diltiazem for rate control.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 454 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal

The patient is receiving various medications, including metoprolol, diltiazem, and morphine PCA for pain control. The patient is also receiving TPN with lipids for nutrition and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* SBO-related complications, such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, or bleeding
* Atrial fibrillation-related complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias
* Crohn's disease-related complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction
* Prolonged ICU stay and potential development of ICU-acquired complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to prolonged enteral nutrition or inadequate caloric intake
* Increased risk of bleeding or hemorrhage due to the patient's history of Crohn's disease and SBO
* Potential development of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's compromised immune system and presence of invasive lines and tubes."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, status post colonic resection, and atrial fibrillation (AF). She was admitted to the ICU due to small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with IV metoprolol and transitioning to oral diltiazem. She is also experiencing pain, which is being controlled with morphine PCA and toradol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient is at risk for intestinal ischemia, perforation, and sepsis.
3. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient's impaired glucose tolerance is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient is at risk for hyperglycemia, which can lead to ketoacidosis and other complications.
4. Crohn's Disease: The patient's Crohn's disease is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient is at risk for relapse, which can lead to complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, and sepsis.
5. Nutritional Complications: The patient's TPN with lipids is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient is at risk for malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and liver dysfunction.
6. Medication-Related Complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including IV metoprolol, oral diltiazem, and morphine PCA. The patient is at risk for medication-related complications such as hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly given her history of Crohn's disease and SBO. The patient requires close monitoring for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. The patient's care team should work together to ensure that the patient receives optimal care and management."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.
   -ISS
   .
   #. Crohn's Disease: Pt with multiple [**Doctor First Name 213**] and complications.  s/p abd
   surgery. Pt is no longer on Humira.  Holding po meds, thus unable to
   take Mesalamine. Will restart when able to tolerate po.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.

   Disposition: Called out to surgery<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She is currently in the ICU for rate control of atrial fibrillation and management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) with jejunal resection.

The patient has been experiencing acute pain, chronic pain, and tachycardia post-op. She is NPO, including medications, and has been placed back on IV diltiazem due to high residuals and inability to absorb PO diltiazem.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: Given the patient's history of SBO and jejunal resection, there is a risk of abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient's abdominal drains are draining serosanguinous fluid, which may indicate ongoing inflammation or bleeding.
2. Worsening anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped by 5 points, which may indicate ongoing bleeding or blood loss.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which may be contributing to her post-op stress and pain. Tight glucose control may be necessary to promote healing.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection due to her SBO and jejunal resection. The MRSA screen is pending, and the patient is receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole as part of her antibiotic regimen.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with an ABG of //25/. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, but her SpO2 is only 96%. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is ongoing, and she is at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's SBO and jejunal resection may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of her abdominal drains and output.
2. Regular assessment of her respiratory status and oxygen therapy.
3. Tight glucose control to promote healing.
4. Antibiotic therapy to prevent infection.
5. Pain management to reduce tachycardia and promote comfort.
6. Cardiovascular monitoring to prevent cardiac complications.
7. Gastrointestinal monitoring to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
8. Nutrition support to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake.
9. Regular communication with the patient and her husband to ensure that they are aware of her condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.
   -ISS
   .
   #. Crohn's Disease: Pt with multiple [**Doctor First Name 213**] and complications.  s/p abd
   surgery. Pt is no longer on Humira.  Holding po meds, thus unable to
   take Mesalamine. Will restart when able to tolerate po.

   Disposition: Called out to surgery<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip and is currently NPO, including medications.

The patient has undergone jejunal resection for small bowel obstruction and is currently on IV diltiazem, metoprolol, and morphine PCA for pain control. She has a colostomy and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL and a hematocrit of 27.6%. Her glucose level is elevated, at 120 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, which is being managed with diltiazem drip and metoprolol.
2. Small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions, which is being managed with nasogastric suction and IV fluids.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome, which is being monitored closely.
4. Anemia, which is being managed with blood transfusions as needed.
5. Hyperglycemia, which is being managed with tight glucose control.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension, which could be exacerbated by the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and small bowel obstruction.
2. Respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and small bowel obstruction.
3. Infection, which could be exacerbated by the patient's history of Crohn's disease and multiple prior surgeries.
4. Bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the patient's history of Crohn's disease and multiple prior surgeries.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue diltiazem drip and metoprolol for rate control and pain management.
2. Monitor the patient's abdominal compartment syndrome closely and manage accordingly.
3. Continue IV fluids and electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia closely and manage with blood transfusions as needed.
5. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with tight glucose control.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and manage accordingly.
7. Continue prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 CALLED OUT
   - surgery ok with pt taking PO drugs, restarted on PO dilt via NGT
   - given lopressor 10mg x 2 instead of lopressor 20mg x 2 overnight
   because of concerns of hypotension.  After lopressor given, SBP would
   go down to 80s-90s
   - lopressor held once for low BP
   - AM dose of lopressor held to 2.5 mg
   - patient complaining that it's difficult to sleep on PCA pump, have to
   wake up to push the button.  ICU team wanted to add basal dose of
   morphine via PCA pump for more constant pain control.  Surgery wanted
   to switch to fentanyl patch.
   - pt switched from PCA pump to fentanyl patch with IV morphine for
   breakthrough pain with adequate pain management.  Surgery wants to put
   patient back on PCA pump with max dose of 10mg/hr despite low BPs
   - called out to surgery, sign out given, awaiting transfer

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 CALLED OUT
   - surgery ok with pt taking PO drugs, restarted on PO dilt via NGT
   - given lopressor 10mg x 2 instead of lopressor 20mg x 2 overnight
   because of concerns of hypotension.  After lopressor given, SBP would
   go down to 80s-90s
   - lopressor held once for low BP
   - AM dose of lopressor held to 2.5 mg
   - patient complaining that it's difficult to sleep on PCA pump, have to
   wake up to push the button.  ICU team wanted to add basal dose of
   morphine via PCA pump for more constant pain control.  Surgery wanted
   to switch to fentanyl patch.
   - pt switched from PCA pump to fentanyl patch with IV morphine for
   breakthrough pain with adequate pain management.  Surgery wants to put
   patient back on PCA pump with max dose of 10mg/hr despite low BPs
   - called out to surgery, sign out given, awaiting transfer

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She is currently admitted to the ICU following jejunal resection for small bowel obstruction.

The patient's current conditions include:

* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR)
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO) with intussusception and adhesions
* Abdominal surgery with colostomy and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid
* Anemia with a 5-point hematocrit drop over the past two days
* Hyperglycemia with a fasting blood sugar (FBS) of 150s
* Crohn's disease with multiple complications and current treatment hold

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 89/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Metoprolol IV (held to lower doses overnight due to hypotension)
* Morphine sulfate IV (for pain control)
* Lorazepam IV (for sedation)
* Diltiazem PO (via NG tube)
* Vancomycin IV (per surgery recommendation)
* Levoquinolone IV (per surgery recommendation)
* Flagyl IV (per surgery recommendation)
* Zofran IV (for nausea)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.4
* Hematocrit (Hct): 27.6
* Platelet count (Plt): 324
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 17 mg/dL
* Glucose: 120 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anemia and platelet count
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to infected drains or other sources
* Worsening of small bowel obstruction and potential need for further surgery
* Development of abdominal compartment syndrome due to fluid accumulation
* Hyperglycemic crisis or diabetic ketoacidosis due to uncontrolled blood glucose levels
* Infection or sepsis due to inadequate wound care or other sources

Based on the patient's current conditions and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue PO diltiazem via NG tube
* Consider decreasing metoprolol to 5-10 mg IV q4hrs or decreasing frequency
* Monitor for signs of cardiac arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and anemia
* Monitor for signs of sepsis or septic shock
* Monitor for signs of worsening small bowel obstruction and abdominal compartment syndrome
* Monitor for signs of hyperglycemic crisis or diabetic ketoacidosis
* Continue to monitor and manage blood glucose levels
* Continue to monitor and manage electrolyte levels
* Continue to monitor and manage blood pressure
* Continue to monitor and manage oxygen saturation
* Continue to monitor and manage respiratory rate
* Continue to monitor and manage temperature
* Continue to monitor and manage pain levels
* Continue to monitor and manage nausea and vomiting levels
* Continue to monitor and manage bowel movements and abdominal distension
* Continue to monitor and manage wound healing and infection risk
* Continue to monitor and manage potential complications of Crohn's disease."
