   Assessment and Plan
   89 F w/ PMHx of hypothyroid, prior syncopal episodes of unknown
   etiology presents w/ syncope and high degree AV block, now s/p
   temporary pacer placement.
   #) Syncope:  Secondary to AV block versus seizures with increased vagal
   tone.  Patient
s telemetry demonstrates increased vagal tone during
   asystolic episode where P-P intervals also increased during the high
   degree block.  This may suggest seizures with increased vagal outflow
   as an etiology, which fits clinically with the episodes of
blank
   stares
 that patient
s son describes.
   - F/U EEG results, so far no seizure activity or capture of temporary
   pacer wires.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP following, temp wire in place, rate set at 50.  Plan to place PPM
   today or tomorrow.
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Pacer pads in place, temp pacer wire in place
   - neuro c/s appreciated, f/u recs
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   #) Restless Leg Syndrome: will decrease mirapex to 0.75 mg qhs, no
   evidence of arrhythmia effects of medication, prn low dose bzds as
   adjunct.
   #) Osteoporosis: continue fosamax, calcium, vitamin d
   #) Prophylaxis: taking PO, sc heparin, bowel regimen, aspirin for
   primary prevention

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism, who presented with syncope and high-degree AV block. She was admitted to the ICU and underwent temporary pacemaker placement. Her current condition is stable, with no recurrent bradycardia or syncope. She is being monitored on telemetry and is awaiting EEG results to determine if seizures are contributing to her symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent bradycardia or syncope: Given the patient's history of syncope and high-degree AV block, there is a risk of recurrent bradycardia or syncope, which could lead to further complications.
2. Seizures: If the EEG results show seizure activity, it could indicate that seizures are contributing to the patient's symptoms, which could lead to further complications.
3. Pacemaker-related complications: The patient is awaiting permanent pacemaker placement, which carries risks such as infection, bleeding, or cardiac tamponade.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could lead to further complications if not properly managed, such as myxedema coma or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis could lead to further complications such as fractures or osteoporotic compression fractures.
6. Restless Leg Syndrome: The patient's Restless Leg Syndrome could lead to further complications such as sleep disturbances, anxiety, or depression.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of indwelling lines and devices could increase the risk of infection.
8. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobility and prolonged hospitalization could increase the risk of venous thromboembolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and vital signs closely.
2. Await EEG results to determine if seizures are contributing to the patient's symptoms.
3. Plan for permanent pacemaker placement as soon as possible.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and restless leg syndrome.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider tube feeding if necessary.
6. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider psychotropic medications if necessary.
8. Consider involving a geriatrician or other specialists to help manage the patient's complex medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism, prior syncopal episodes of unknown etiology, and a recent episode of syncope with high-degree AV block. She has been admitted to the ICU with a temporary pacemaker in place.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 98.4°F (37.1°C)
* Heart rate: 68-84 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 128/55-163/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Alert and oriented x3 with no signs of distress
* Normal cranial nerves, motor strength, and sensory function
* No evidence of lymphadenopathy or skin lesions
* Normal abdominal examination with no masses or organomegaly

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.6-6.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 235-236 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 94-102 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and plan include:

* Syncope: further evaluation with EEG, telemetry monitoring, and electrophysiology (EP) study
* Hypothyroidism: continued treatment with levothyroxine
* Restless leg syndrome: decreased dosage of mirapex to 0.75 mg qhs
* Osteoporosis: continued treatment with fosamax, calcium, and vitamin D
* Prophylaxis: continued treatment with PO and sc heparin, bowel regimen, and aspirin for primary prevention
* FEN: regular diet with repletion of electrolytes as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Arrhythmias: given the patient's history of syncope and high-degree AV block, arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia may occur
* Seizures: the patient's history of syncopal episodes and the possibility of seizures as an etiology for the episodes of blank stares may lead to seizures
* Respiratory complications: the patient's age and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Gastrointestinal complications: the patient's age and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, diarrhea, or bleeding
* Infections: the patient's age and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of infections such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or sepsis
* Cardiac complications: the patient's history of syncope and high-degree AV block may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest."

   tone.  Patient
s telemetry demonstrates increased vagal tone during
   asystolic episode where P-P intervals also increased during the high
   degree block.  This may suggest seizures with increased vagal outflow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism, who presented with syncope and high-degree AV block. She has been admitted to the ICU for temporary pacemaker placement. She has been diagnosed with restless leg syndrome and is being treated with clonazepam. She has a history of osteoporosis and is being treated with fosamax, calcium, and vitamin D. She is also being treated with prophylactic heparin and aspirin for primary prevention.

Physical Examination:

The patient appears younger than her stated age, awake, and alert. Her lungs are clear, and her heart rhythm is normal. Her abdomen is soft, and her bowel sounds are normal. Her extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Her skin is without rashes or lesions. Her neurologic examination is normal, with intact cranial nerves, normal bulk, strength, and tone, and normal reflexes.

Lab Results:

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 34.1%
* Platelet count: 235 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.6 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 13 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Trop-T: <0.01
* Glucose: 102 mg/dL
* Calcium: 9.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
* Potassium: 29 mEq/L
* Sodium: 133 mEq/L
* Chloride: 98 mEq/L

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient's history of syncope and high-degree AV block, combined with the possibility of seizures with increased vagal tone, may suggest a risk of seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's age and underlying medical conditions.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of high-degree AV block and the possibility of seizures with increased vagal tone may suggest a risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and osteoporosis may increase the risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of osteoporosis and the use of anticoagulant medications may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's history of osteoporosis and the use of anticoagulant medications may increase the risk of thrombosis.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of osteoporosis may increase the risk of fractures and osteoporotic-related complications.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may increase the risk of hypothyroidism-related complications, such as myxedema coma."
