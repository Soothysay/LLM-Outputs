You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe epistaxis requiring balloon packing. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on warfarin, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. His current medications include cefazolin, diltiazem, metoprolol, and labetalol. He has been experiencing difficulty controlling his blood pressure and has been given hydralazine and labetalol to manage it. He has also been experiencing withdrawal symptoms from Ativan and Valium.

Physical examination reveals:

* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse, left radial pulse, right DP pulse, and left DP pulse not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, and tone not assessed

Lab results show:

* WBC: 9.1-11.2
* Hct: 37.5-40.6
* Plt: 349-365
* Cr: 0.7-0.8
* Glucose: 104-125
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.0/23.0/1.2, ALT/AST: 22/22, Alk Phos/T Bili: 79/0.7, Differential-Neuts: 82.1%, Lymph: 10.9%, Mono: 6.4%, Eos: 0.3%, Albumin: 3.9 g/dL, LDH: 171 IU/L, Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

Assessment and plan:

* Epistaxis: Hemostasis achieved with intranasal balloon. ENT to evaluate in the morning.
* HTN: Patient is non-compliant with home regimen. Start PO lisinopril 5mg and up titrate as tolerated. Give PO hydralazine prn for SBP>180.
* H/o DVT: Last documented in [**11-6**] with plan for warfarin therapy. Patient is non-compliant with INR checks. Resume anticoagulation with lovenox to warfarin bridge once epistaxis resolved.
* H/o EOTH Abuse: Monitor closely for signs of withdrawal. CIWA scale with prn Valium. Check LFTs, recommend outpatient follow-up.
* FEN: NPO pending ENT eval in the morning.
* Access: PIV x2.
* PPx: DVT ppx with pneumoboots, bowel regimen colace/senna prn, pain management with morphine IV prn.
* Code: Full code.
* Dispo: Pending above hemodynamic stability, ICU for now.

Potential medical complications:

* Continued bleeding from epistaxis
* Hypertensive crisis
* Withdrawal symptoms from Ativan and Valium
* Thrombocytopenia
* Coagulopathy
* Infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection)
* Liver damage from chronic alcohol abuse
* Kidney damage from hypotension and/or medications
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular complications (e.g., arrhythmias, heart failure)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on warfarin, poorly controlled hypertension, and epistaxis. The patient has been experiencing bleeding, which appears to have stopped, and is awaiting embolization via neuro interventional radiology.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 96 bpm (normal range: 86-118 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 161/89 mmHg (normal range: 126/72 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-29 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.1-11.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 349-365 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-125 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include:

    * PT/PTT/INR: 14.0/23.0/1.2
    * ALT/AST: 22/22 IU/L
    * Alkaline phosphatase/T bilirubin: 79/0.7 IU/L
    * Differential-Neuts: 82.1%
    * Lymph: 10.9%
    * Mono: 6.4%
    * Eos: 0.3%
    * Albumin: 3.9 g/dL
    * LDH: 171 IU/L
    * Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL
    * Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
    * PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuation of cefazolin 1gm Q8H while packing in place
* Trending of hemoglobin and coagulation studies
* Control of blood pressure with goal systolic blood pressure <150 mmHg
* Hold on further anticoagulation for now
* Uptitration of hydralazine and lisinopril
* IV labetalol prn for systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg
* Resume anticoagulation with lovenox to warfarin bridge once epistaxis resolved
* CIWA scale with prn valium
* Check LFTs and recommend outpatient follow-up
* Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis
* Bowel regimen with colace/senna prn
* Pain management with morphine IV prn

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding complications due to continued bleeding or bleeding from the embolization procedure
* Hypertensive crisis due to uncontrolled blood pressure
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to lack of anticoagulation
* Withdrawal symptoms due to benzodiazepine taper
* Respiratory complications due to pneumonia or aspiration
* Cardiovascular complications due to hypertension, bleeding, or anticoagulation therapy
* Gastrointestinal complications due to bowel regimen or bleeding
* Neurological complications due to bleeding or embolization procedure"

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with epistaxis (nosebleed) and significant bleeding. He has been receiving treatment with Valium and Ativan for withdrawal, Afrin for recurrent bleeding, and antibiotics (Cefazolin) for infection. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/91 mmHg. He is receiving respiratory support and has a SpO2 of 94%. His physical examination is notable for diminished breath sounds and soft, non-tender abdomen. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving coagulation factors and platelets, and his bleeding has improved with packing and Afrin. However, the bleeding is still recurrent, and consideration is being given to interventional radiology (IR) intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding is still recurrent, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications, including hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly pneumonia, due to his respiratory support and underlying condition.
3. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or injury, which could lead to further complications, including liver failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and underlying condition may put him at risk of nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, and there is a risk of neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulation factor deficiencies may put him at risk of coagulopathy, which could lead to further bleeding complications."

   64 yo M with h/o DVT on warfarin(INR 1.5 ) poorly controlled HTN p/w
   epistaxis
   #. Epistaxis HCt has remained stable, slowly trending downward,
   bleeding appears to have stopped. Per ENT next step will be to embolize
   via neuro IR.
   - appreciate ENT recommendations, if pt bleeds significantly again will
   need to embolize by IR
   - continue pressure dressing with balloon
   - continue cefazolin 1gm Q8H while packing in place
   -can use afrin generously to right nostril if bleeds
 would discuss
   with ENT if plan to use after [**2127-5-16**] given risk for later rebound
   - trend HCt Q12H
   - hold on further anticoagulation, no plan to restart anticoagulatio
   after discharge
   .
   # Supraventricular tachycardia: unable to capture on EKG given pt has
   short bursts into the 150s.  Pt asymptomatic during these episodes.
   Unlikely related to EtoH withdrawal as pt does not show other signs of
   withdrawal.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. HTN, uncontrolled, unlikely to represent etoh withdrawl as is
   longstanding.  Had some hypotension this AM after receiving 2 BP meds
   -d/c hydralazine
   -BP control with lisinopril and labetolol
   .
   #. H/o DVT - Last documented in [**11-6**] with plan for warfarin therapy.
   Patient is non-compliant with INR checks.
   - no plan to resume anticoagulation after d/c, pt
s nose bleed was in
   setting of sub therapeutic INR
   .
   #. H/o EOTH Abuse
 tachycardia earlier in hospitalization had not
   responded to valium and not agitated so doubt that this represents
   withdrawl.
   - CIWA scale with prn valium
   - check LFTs, recommend outpt f/u

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of nose bleed. He has a history of DVT and was on warfarin therapy, but has been non-compliant with INR checks. He also has a history of hypertension, which is poorly controlled. He was given valium and labetalol for hypertension and tachycardia, and his Hct remained stable. He had bursts of supraventricular tachycardia overnight, but was asymptomatic. He was also given cefazolin for antibiotic prophylaxis.

Assessment:

The patient's nose bleed has stopped, and his Hct has remained stable. However, he has a history of DVT and is at risk for further bleeding. He also has poorly controlled hypertension, which may be contributing to his tachycardia. His supraventricular tachycardia is likely unrelated to ethanol withdrawal, as he does not show other signs of withdrawal.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's history of DVT and non-compliance with INR checks puts him at risk for further bleeding.
2. Hypertension: The patient's poorly controlled hypertension may lead to further complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient's supraventricular tachycardia may lead to further complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
4. Ethanol withdrawal: Although the patient does not show other signs of withdrawal, he may still be at risk for ethanol withdrawal syndrome.
5. Infection: The patient's history of DVT and antibiotic prophylaxis may put him at risk for infection.

Plan:

1. Continue pressure dressing with balloon to control bleeding.
2. Continue cefazolin for antibiotic prophylaxis.
3. Monitor Hct and INR regularly to ensure stability.
4. Control hypertension with labetalol and lisinopril.
5. Monitor supraventricular tachycardia and consider further treatment if necessary.
6. Consider further evaluation for ethanol withdrawal syndrome.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and treat promptly if necessary.
8. Plan for discharge after hemodynamic stability is achieved."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Physical Examination
   64 yo M with h/o DVT on warfarin(INR 1.5 ) poorly controlled HTN p/w
   epistaxis
   #. Epistaxis HCt has remained stable, slowly trending downward,
   bleeding appears to have stopped. Per ENT next step will be to embolize
   via neuro IR.
   - appreciate ENT recommendations
   - continue pressure dressing with balloon
   - continue cefazolin 1gm Q8H while packing in place
   - trend HCt Q12H and coags
   - control BP, goal SBP<150
   - hold on further anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. HTN, uncontrolled, unlikely to represent withdrawl as is
   longstanding
   - uptitrate hydralazine and lisinopril
   - give IV labetalol prn for SBP>180
   .
   #. H/o DVT - Last documented in [**11-6**] with plan for warfarin therapy.
   Patient is non-compliant with INR checks.
   - resume anticoagulation with lovenox to warfarin bridge once epistaxis
   resolved
   .
   #. H/o EOTH Abuse
 tachycardia has not responded to valium and not
   agitated so doubt that this represents withdrawl.
   - CIWA scale with prn valium
   - check LFTs, recommend outpt f/u

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of nose bleed. He has a history of DVT on warfarin with an INR of 1.5, poorly controlled hypertension, and a history of epistaxis. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has remained stable, but his bleeding appears to have stopped. The plan is to continue pressure dressing with a balloon and to embolize via neuro IR if the bleeding recurs.

The patient's hypertension is uncontrolled, and he is being treated with hydralazine and lisinopril. His tachycardia has not responded to valium and is not thought to be withdrawal-related. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is being monitored for withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, but otherwise, his laboratory values are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding has stopped, but there is a risk of recurrence if the embolization procedure is not successful.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is uncontrolled, and there is a risk of further complications if it is not adequately managed.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is not thought to be withdrawal-related, but it may be a sign of an underlying condition that needs to be investigated.
4. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT, and there is a risk of recurrence if he is not adequately anticoagulated.
5. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is at risk of withdrawal symptoms if he is not adequately managed.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the setting of a compromised immune system and the use of indwelling catheters.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, and there is a risk of bleeding if it falls further.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, and there is a risk of further complications if they are not adequately managed."
