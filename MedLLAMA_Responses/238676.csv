   Chief Complaint: AV endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   - Throughout the day yesterday, patient began to have increased work of
   breathing and his anemia was worsening
   -Given 2 units blood and put out lots of urine (2L+) with 40mg IV Lasix
   and then 20mg IV Lasix
   -Patient had repeat TTE that showed markedly worsening aortic valve.
   He was transferred back to the CCU.
   -A TEE  was done that showed the abscess was larger, but valve not
   acutely falling apart
   -CT surgery, ID, and CCU team jointly decided that the best course
   would be surgery in the morning morning ([**9-9**]).
   -FU Hct 27.5 after blood (up from 22.9).
   -Started gentamicin 90 mg IV Q8H because infection still growing
   -Patient had MRA of brain and per prelim read, no mycotic aneurysm.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   who presented with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage.  He appeared to
   stabilized after admission, but the became anemia again and developed
   worsening symptoms of heart failure yesterday.
   .
   # Endocarditis: He has had embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, cerebral hemispheres, and left cerebellum. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.   He is currently
   hemodynamically stable but worsening overall.  He will go for CT
   surgery today for AVR and possible CABG.  Have stopped Ceftriaxone and
   started Gentamicin, as this is the proven treatment for enterococcal
   endocarditis.
   - CT surgery today for AVR and ?CABG
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Continue Ampicllin (Day 4 at [**Hospital1 54**]) and Gentamicin (Day 2 at [**Hospital1 54**])
   per ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable but with worsening disease and advancement of
   infection on TTE/TEE.
   - CT Surgery today
   - Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce sheer
   force
   - Have stopped coumadin (INR today=1.4), now on heparin drip which will
   be continued until surgery
   - Holding carvedilol due to low BP
   - CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as
   currently coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**]. CT aorta ruled out aortoenteric fistula but
   some concern for GI bleed in guaiac positive patient that is throwing
   emboli.  Anemia also likely secondary to marrow suppression from an
   active inflammatory state.
   - Hct stable at 26.4 today.  Have type and crossed 5 units in
   preparation for surgery.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Recommend transfusion for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable and actually with decreased
   pain.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Interventional Cards following and appreciate recs
 will monitor at
   this point, no intervention at this time
   - Follow pulses daily
   # Coronaries: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did
   have a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall
   motion abnormality on TTE at admission concerning for emboli in the
   coronaries..
   - [**Month (only) 60**] get CABG at same time of AVR today
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   - Have been tapering suboxone in preparation for surgery
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] of addiction service is following with management of
   subxone and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   - Recommend aggressive pain management in the post-op period, as
   patient had major issues with pain at his last surgery
   - Hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # Pump: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows worsening
   EF due to AV disease.  Diuresed well with total 60mg IV lasix yesterday
   (40mg IV + 20mg IV)
   - Continue to diurese as necessary
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient currently in NSR with HR in the 70
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block that might
   represent worsening infection
    # Acute Renal Failure:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   1.2. Likely due to pre-renal etiology with continued diuresis and
   hypotensive state in OSH.
   - Continue to follow
   # Anxiety: Patient with anxiety pre-op.  Have been using Ativan 1mg po
   q4h prn for anxiety which works well.
   - Continue Ativan prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   who presented with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage.  He appeared to
   stabilized after admission, but the became anemia again and developed
   worsening symptoms of heart failure yesterday.
   .
   # Endocarditis: He has had embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, cerebral hemispheres, and left cerebellum. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.   He is currently
   hemodynamically stable but worsening overall.  He will go for CT
   surgery today for AVR and possible CABG.  Have stopped Ceftriaxone and
   started Gentamicin, as this is the proven treatment for enterococcal
   endocarditis.
   - CT surgery today for AVR and ?CABG
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Continue Ampicllin (Day 4 at [**Hospital1 54**]) and Gentamicin (Day 2 at [**Hospital1 54**])
   per ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable but with worsening disease and advancement of
   infection on TTE/TEE.
   - CT Surgery today
   - Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce sheer
   force
   - Have stopped coumadin (INR today=1.4), now on heparin drip which will
   be continued until surgery
   - Holding carvedilol due to low BP
   - CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as
   currently coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**]. CT aorta ruled out aortoenteric fistula but
   some concern for GI bleed in guaiac positive patient that is throwing
   emboli.  Anemia also likely secondary to marrow suppression from an
   active inflammatory state.
   - Hct stable at 26.4 today.  Have type and crossed 5 units in
   preparation for surgery.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Recommend transfusion for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable and actually with decreased
   pain.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Interventional Cards following and appreciate recs
 will monitor at
   this point, no intervention at this time
   - Follow pulses daily
   # Coronaries: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did
   have a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall
   motion abnormality on TTE at admission concerning for emboli in the
   coronaries..
   - [**Month (only) 60**] get CABG at same time of AVR today
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   - Have been tapering suboxone in preparation for surgery
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] of addiction service is following with management of
   subxone and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   - Recommend aggressive pain management in the post-op period, as
   patient had major issues with pain at his last surgery
   - Hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # Pump: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows worsening
   EF due to AV disease.  Diuresed well with total 60mg IV lasix yesterday
   (40mg IV + 20mg IV)
   - Continue to diurese as necessary
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient currently in NSR with HR in the 70
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block that might
   represent worsening infection
    # Acute Renal Failure:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   1.2. Likely due to pre-renal etiology with continued diuresis and
   hypotensive state in OSH.
   - Continue to follow
   # Anxiety: Patient with anxiety pre-op.  Have been using Ativan 1mg po
   q4h prn for anxiety which works well.
   - Continue Ativan prn

* Pulses: Right DP 2+, PT 2+, left DP non-palpable (biphasic on Doppler), PT 1+

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

* Endocarditis: The patient has had embolic phenomena to multiple sites, and the infection is likely to progress if not treated aggressively.
* Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient's aortic valve is dehiscent, and the infection is likely to worsen if not treated promptly.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory state and may worsen if not treated aggressively.
* L foot embolic disease: The patient has severe left tibial disease, and the foot appears warm and well-perfused currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on the left.
* Coronaries: The patient has new wall motion abnormality on TTE at admission concerning for emboli in the coronaries.
* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and the patient is likely to develop acute renal failure if not treated promptly.
* Anxiety: The patient is anxious pre-op and has been using Ativan 1mg po q4h prn for anxiety.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* CT surgery today for AVR and possible CABG
* ID consulting and appreciation of recommendations
* Continue Ampicillin and Gentamicin per ID recommendations
* BCx pending
