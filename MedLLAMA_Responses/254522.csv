   1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
   2. Multifocal consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobe,
   likely
   infection, although underlying malignancy can not be excluded. Given
   history
   of lung cancer, recommend followup imaging to resolution to exclude
   underlying
   lesion.
   3. Increased number of anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, not enlarged
   by size
   criteria, but increased in number.
   4. Likely small amount of sludge layering in the gallbladder without
   acute
   cholecystitis.
   CT Head prelim read:
   No definite abnormality. Left cerebellar tubular density likely vessel.
   Note
   that MRI is more sensitive for metastases and is recommended if
   symptoms
   persist.
   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have developed
   aspiration pneumonia in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying
   lung function not entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and
   that she is s/p lobectomy.  Also consistent with influenze given
   weakness, n/v, and cough.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days
   - FU urine legionella
   - Continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send sputum culture
   # Hypotension:  Close to baseline, but likely worse [**2-16**] dehydration +/-
   sepsis.  She is currently dehydrated on exam and labs are c/w
   hemoconcentration.
   - volume resuscitation using HR, Uop to titrate fluids
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), increased intracranial pressure (especially given
   possible cerebellar findings on exam and h/o lung cancer), or
   pancreatitis.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea, although
   EKG is reassuring.  Could also be influenza as above.
   - FU head CT read
   - if head CT is negative, MRI with contrast as outpatient
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - follow serial cardiac biomarkers, will get one more set this
   afternoon
   - Add stool studies
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   near baseline with IVF overnight, likely was secondary to dehydration
   and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   now with significant hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional.
   Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Check pm Hct
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy:
   - will contact oncology providers to make them aware of admission

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, cough, and weakness. She underwent a lobectomy and has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She also has a history of emphysema and has been prescribed tamiflu for influenza. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. Her laboratory results show anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperlipidemia. She is also experiencing anxiety and has a history of anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and weakness are consistent with pneumonia. The CT scan shows multifocal consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobes, which is likely due to infection.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of nasuea and vomiting, as well as her recent lobectomy, increase her risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Dehydration: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output suggest dehydration.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count suggest sepsis.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's decreased hemoglobin level and hematocrit suggest anemia.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's elevated cholesterol level and triglyceride level suggest hyperlipidemia.
8. Anxiety: The patient's symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia and hyperventilation, suggest anxiety.
9. Lung Cancer Recurrence: The patient's history of NSCLC and recent lobectomy increase her risk of developing lung cancer recurrence.
10. Underlying Malignancy: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and weakness, as well as her history of lung cancer, suggest the possibility of an underlying malignancy.

Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and provide aggressive treatment for her pneumonia, dehydration, and sepsis. Additionally, it is important to consider the possibility of lung cancer recurrence and underlying malignancy."

   1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
   2. Multifocal consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobe,
   likely
   infection, although underlying malignancy can not be excluded. Given
   history
   of lung cancer, recommend followup imaging to resolution to exclude
   underlying
   lesion.
   3. Increased number of anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, not enlarged

   criteria, but increased in number.
   4. Likely small amount of sludge layering in the gallbladder without
   acute
   cholecystitis.
   CT Head prelim read:

   Note
   that MRI is more sensitive for metastases and is recommended if
   symptoms
   persist.
   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have developed
   aspiration pneumonia in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying
   lung function not entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and
   that she is s/p lobectomy.  Also consistent with influenze given
   weakness, n/v, and cough.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days
   - FU urine legionella
   - Continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have emailed oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Hypotension:  Close to baseline, but likely worse [**2-16**] dehydration.
   She is somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.
   Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus) or possibly influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion.  Increased intracranial pressure less likely
   given normal CT.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea,
   although EKG is reassuring and cardiac biomarkers negative.
   Pancreatitis not likely due to normal amylase and lipase.
   - FU final head CT read
   - if head CT is negative, may need MRI with contrast as outpatient,
   will defer to oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - Add stool studies if develops diarrhea
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   near baseline with IVF overnight, likely was secondary to dehydration
   and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   - Check pm lytes today as needed significant repletion last night
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   now with significant hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 116 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 123/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* NSCLC with recent lobectomy
* Emphysema on lung biopsy
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Osteoporosis
* Anxiety

The patient's current medications include:

* Ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 7-10 days
* Tamiflu pending influenza swab
* Atrovent and albuterol nebs as needed
* Zofran for nausea

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia
* Aspiration pneumonia
* Influenza
* Viral gastroenteritis
* Food poisoning/toxin ingestion
* Acute renal failure
* Anemia
* Hyperlipidemia
* Osteoporosis
* Anxiety

Based on the provided information, the patient's condition is stable, and she is receiving appropriate treatment for her pneumonia and other medical issues. However, she is at risk for developing complications such as pneumonia, acute renal failure, and anemia, and will require close monitoring and management to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days  (today is
   day 3 of 7)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.  Now BP
   increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion.  Increased intracranial pressure less likely
   given normal CT.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea,
   although EKG is reassuring and cardiac biomarkers negative.
   Pancreatitis not likely due to normal amylase and lipase.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - Add stool studies if develops diarrhea
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now near baseline
   and stable.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy:
   - have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make them aware of admission,
   are following
   - not currently receiving active treatment

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and cough. She has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and had a recent lobectomy. The patient's condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, which is likely due to her recent surgery and underlying lung function. She also has hypotension, which has been stabilized with volume resuscitation. The patient is experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be related to viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning. She has acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to dehydration and hypotension. The patient's anemia is likely due to hemoconcentration and dilutional anemia. She has a history of lung cancer, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia is a significant risk factor for respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disorders.
3. Dehydration: The patient's dehydration is a risk factor for hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and death.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular complications, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Lung Cancer: The patient's lung cancer is a risk factor for metastases, recurrence, and death.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis is a risk factor for fractures, osteoporotic compression fractures, and spinal cord compression.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is a risk factor for cardiovascular complications, insomnia, and decreased quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Provide supportive care for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, including anti-emetics and electrolyte replacement.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue anemia management and monitor for signs of bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's lung function and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Continue osteoporosis management and monitor for signs of fractures.
8. Provide psychological support for anxiety and monitor for signs of depression.
9. Consider MRI with contrast to evaluate for metastases and recurrence."

   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days  (today is day
   3 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel that she may be
   volume depleted causing atrial flutter, although labs not consistent
   with this picture.
   - Will give 1L NS now and then reassess
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need rate control with beta blockers, can try 5mg IV metoprolol
   if needed
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.  Now BP
   increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - FU C diff for diarrhea
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now near baseline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, cough, and fever. She underwent a lobectomy and developed aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has been improving, but she still experiences dyspnea, chest pain, and diarrhea. She has been treated with antibiotics, and her pneumonia is being managed with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators. The patient's atrial flutter has been stabilized with fluid resuscitation and beta blockers. Her hypotension has improved, and her renal function has returned to baseline. The patient's nausea and vomiting have been managed with antiemetics, and her diarrhea has been treated with antidiarrheal agents.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia is a significant concern, and there is a risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may require rate control with beta blockers, and there is a risk of developing atrial fibrillation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to dehydration, and there is a risk of developing hypovolemic shock.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may be secondary to dehydration and hypotension, and there is a risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to hemoconcentration and dilution, and there is a risk of developing chronic anemia.
6. Lung Cancer: The patient's lung cancer may be recurrent, and there is a risk of developing metastases.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea may be secondary to viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning, and there is a risk of developing complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and oxygen therapy to manage the patient's pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial flutter and adjust treatment as necessary to control the heart rate.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with
   likely aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days  (today is day
   4 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appropriate
   follow-up
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel likely related to new
   lung pathology.  Given 5mg IV metoprolol x2 over last 24 hours with
   good effect.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg po TID
   - Will repeat IV dosing as needed for rate control
   - Can consider cardioversion in this patient when rate controlled
   - Need to address issue of anticoagulation: CHADS2 score is 0, but
   likely should be taking aspirin daily
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam on admission but has been volume
   resuscitated.  Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Encourage PO intake
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - FU C diff for diarrhea
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now stable
   between 27 and 30.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy: Have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make
   them aware of admission, are following and she has outpatient follow-up
   already scheduled
   - not currently receiving active treatment

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recently underwent a lobectomy. She is currently experiencing aspiration pneumonia, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, and hypotension. She is also experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be related to viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Her creatinine levels are elevated, likely due to dehydration and hypotension, and she has anemia, which is likely dilutional. She is receiving various medications, including beta blockers, antivirals, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response may require cardioversion, and she may be at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and possible secondary bacterial infections may lead to sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may be at risk for further renal damage or failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
6. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms make her susceptible to various infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen her respiratory and cardiac status, and she may require transfusions.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to dehydration, sepsis, or cardiac dysfunction, and she may require vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase her risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.
10. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may increase her risk for fractures, particularly in the setting of immobility and malnutrition.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and medication administration to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with
   likely aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy
   - Continue ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days
   (today is day 4 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions, ruled out flu
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, oncology is aware and will follow-up scans
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel likely related to new
   lung pathology.  Given 5mg IV metoprolol x2 over last 24 hours with
   good effect.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg po TID, appears well rate-controlled with HR
   in the 90
   - Will repeat IV dosing as needed for rate control
   - Can consider cardioversion in this patient when rate controlled
   - Need to address issue of anticoagulation: CHADS2 score is 0, but
   likely should be taking aspirin daily
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam on admission but has been volume
   resuscitated.  Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Encourage PO intake
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - FU C diff for diarrhea, will be sent this am
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now stable
   between 27 and 30.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy: Have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make
   them aware of admission, are following and she has outpatient follow-up

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of likely aspiration pneumonia following a recent lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She has a history of atrial fibrillation, but it has not been a significant issue in the past. She has been experiencing shortness of breath, cough, and nausea, and has been treated with antibiotics and bronchodilators.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 90s and a blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. She has been experiencing frequent wet cough and has had one episode of diarrhea this morning.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, a decreased hemoglobin level, and an elevated creatinine level. Her troponin level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and her cardiac biomarkers are negative.

The patient's medical history is significant for NSCLC, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. She has a history of emphysema on lung biopsy and has undergone a lobectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her current atrial flutter may require further management with beta blockers or cardioversion.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of likely aspiration pneumonia, which may require further treatment with antibiotics and respiratory support.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may be secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreased, which may be secondary to blood loss or hemolysis.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which may require further management with statins.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which may require further management with bisphosphonates.
7. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety, which may require further management with benzodiazepines.
8. Lung Cancer: The patient has a history of lung cancer, which may require further management with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and bronchodilators as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial flutter and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust fluid management as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and adjust transfusions as necessary.
5. Continue statins and bisphosphonates as prescribed.
6. Continue benzodiazepines as prescribed.
7. Monitor the patient's lung function and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Consider cardioversion for the patient's atrial flutter."
