   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue and found to
   have hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for
   sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with tachypnea,
   hypotension, and elevated lactate. Most likely source is the HD
   catheter which, on exam was red and tender. This AM blood cultures
   taken  in ED grew out GPC in clusters. Urine culture is pending. CXR
   was unimpressive but will repeat for assessment.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 8-12, if needed start levophed to
   maintain MAP>65
   -will contact IR to pull HD tunnel line and replace on Mon/Tues
   - HD today
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   - f/u renal recs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          f/u renal for recommendations
   -          heparin Ab labs
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled.
   -          holding beta blocker until after HD then reassess
   -          hold anticoagulation
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Will hold both until
   hypotension is under control and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - as above
   .
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary (however will hold while he is getting HD).
   -optimize electrolytes
   - strict I/O
   -reassess I/O goals post HD as may continue to be hypotensive
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following. Will contact
   IR to remove tunnel line and replace given likely infection nidus.

   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn

   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, and CAD. He presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, concerning for sepsis. The most likely source of infection is the HD catheter, which was red and tender on exam. Blood cultures grew out GPC in clusters, and urine culture is pending. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin, and will have his HD catheter removed and replaced.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further deterioration and septic shock due to the ongoing infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a possible diagnosis.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further complications.
4. CAD: The patient's CAD is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further complications.
5. CHF: The patient's CHF is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further complications.
6. Stage V Kidney Failure: The patient's kidney function is severely impaired, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
7. COPD: The patient's COPD is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further complications.
8. CVA: The patient has a history of CVA, and he is at risk for further complications.
9. FEN: The patient is NPO, and he is at risk for malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
10. PPX: The patient is taking PPI, and he is at risk for gastrointestinal complications.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is recommended that he be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration, and that his treatment plan be adjusted as necessary to address any complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue and found to
   have hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for
   sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with tachypnea,
   hypotension, and elevated lactate. Most likely source is the HD
   catheter which, on exam was red and tender. This AM blood cultures
   taken  in ED grew out GPC in clusters. Urine culture is pending. CXR
   was unimpressive but will repeat for assessment.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 8-12, if needed start levophed to
   maintain MAP>65
   -will contact IR to pull HD tunnel line and replace on Mon/Tues
   - HD today
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   - f/u renal recs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          f/u renal for recommendations
   -          heparin Ab labs
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled.
   -          holding beta blocker until after HD then reassess
   -          hold anticoagulation
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Will hold both until
   hypotension is under control and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - as above
   .
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary (however will hold while he is getting HD).
   -optimize electrolytes
   - strict I/O
   -reassess I/O goals post HD as may continue to be hypotensive
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following. Will contact
   IR to remove tunnel line and replace given likely infection nidus.
   -          HD this am
   -          -f/u electrolytes
   .
   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn
   - sleep consult
   .
   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up
   -monitor BP

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, concerning for sepsis. He was found to have a red and tender HD catheter, which grew out GPC in clusters on blood cultures. He is currently being treated for sepsis, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and stage V kidney failure on HD.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's condition is critical, and the source of sepsis is likely the HD catheter. He requires continued IV fluids, and if needed, levophed to maintain MAP>65. Repeat CXR and sputum culture are necessary to assess the infection.
2. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a possible cause. Further workup, including heparin Ab labs, is necessary to determine the cause.
3. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient is not anti-coagulated and is rate-controlled. Holding beta blockers until after HD and reassessing anticoagulation is necessary.
4. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has a history of CAD, MI, and CHF. Monitoring I/O closely, optimizing electrolytes, and strict I/O management are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
5. **Kidney Failure:** The patient is on HD and requires close monitoring of electrolytes and I/O.
6. **COPD:** The patient has restrictive physiology on PFTs and is asymptomatic. However, he may require further management, including sleep consult and continued bronchodilators.
7. **CVA:** The patient has a history of CVA with R-sided weakness and is at risk for further complications. Monitoring BP and holding ASA until thrombocytopenia is fully worked up are necessary.
8. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient is NPO and requires electrolyte monitoring and repletion as needed.
9. **Infection:** The patient has a high risk of developing further infections due to his underlying conditions and the presence of a central line.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue IV fluids and levophed as needed to maintain MAP>65.
2. Repeat CXR and sputum culture to assess the infection.
3. Further workup, including heparin Ab labs, is necessary to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.
4. Monitor I/O closely, optimize electrolytes, and strict I/O management are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
5. Close monitoring of electrolytes and I/O is necessary to prevent further kidney complications.
6. Further management, including sleep consult and continued bronchodilators, is necessary for COPD.
7. Monitoring BP and holding ASA until thrombocytopenia is fully worked up are necessary to prevent further CVA complications.
8. Electrolyte monitoring and repletion as needed are necessary to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
9. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue and found to
   have hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for
   sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with tachypnea,
   hypotension, and elevated lactate. Most likely source is the HD
   catheter which, on exam was red and tender. This AM blood cultures
   taken  in ED grew out GPC in clusters. Urine culture is pending. CXR
   was unimpressive but will repeat for assessment.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 8-12, if needed start levophed to
   maintain MAP>65
   -will contact IR to pull HD tunnel line and replace on Mon/Tues
   - HD today
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   - f/u renal recs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          f/u renal for recommendations
   -          heparin Ab labs
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled.
   -          holding beta blocker until after HD then reassess
   -          hold anticoagulation
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Will hold both until
   hypotension is under control and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - as above
   .
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary (however will hold while he is getting HD).
   -optimize electrolytes
   - strict I/O
   -reassess I/O goals post HD as may continue to be hypotensive
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following. Will contact
   IR to remove tunnel line and replace given likely infection nidus.
   -          HD this am
   -          -f/u electrolytes
   .
   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn
   - sleep consult

   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

* Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria on admission, and blood cultures grew out GPC in clusters. The likely source of sepsis is the HD catheter, which is red and tender.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 55 K/uL, which is a significant decrease from his baseline of 92 K/uL. The cause of thrombocytopenia is likely heparin-induced, although other possibilities include HD itself, viral infection, or other drug-induced reactions.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not anti-coagulated. He is currently rate-controlled.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is taking aspirin and a beta blocker at home. These medications will be held until his thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
* CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 60%. His BNP is elevated, and he will be monitored closely for fluid overload.
* Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: The patient is on HD and will continue to receive treatment.
* COPD: The patient has a history of COPD and is asymptomatic at present. He will continue to receive bronchodilators and a sleep consult will be arranged.
* History of CVA: The patient has a history of CVA with R-sided weakness and will continue to be monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The HD catheter is a potential source of infection, and the patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, particularly if he undergoes invasive procedures or receives anticoagulant therapy.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of stroke or other cardiovascular complications.
4. CHF: The patient's CHF may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of fluid overload and cardiovascular complications.
5. Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: The patient's kidney function is likely to continue to decline if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
6. COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of respiratory complications.
7. History of CVA: The patient's history of CVA may increase his risk of recurrent stroke or other neurological complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a fever of 101.1°F, atrial flutter, and hypotension. They have been receiving infusions of pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete, and their skin, neurologic, and respiratory examinations are not assessed. Laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and has a presep catheter and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an infection, which could progress to sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may lead to atrial fibrillation, which could increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, dehydration, or other underlying conditions, which could worsen if not addressed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
5. Liver Enzyme Elevation: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which could lead to further complications if not treated.
6. DVT: The patient's prophylactic heparin sodium infusion may not be sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
7. VAP: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which could worsen their respiratory status.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness may increase their risk of developing stress ulcers, which could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic
   renal cell carcinoma, AFib who presents with fatigue found to have
   hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachypnea, hypotension, and
   elevated lactate. Likely source is pulmonary vs. HD catheter-associated
   line infection vs. urosepsis. PE findings of erythema at HD catheter
   site and tenderness extremely concerning. UA with WBCs but neg
   LE/nitrates. CXR unimpressive.
   - Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc QHD, given history of ESBL,
   will cover with meropenem awaiting cultures
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, sent cultures off both HD catheter
   line ports
   - obtain sputum if possible
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - repeat CXR in am
   - discuss with renal removal of HD line
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:Slightly off baseline at 92 on admission with INR at
   baseline of 1.3.
   - check DIC labs
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled.
   - hold standing BB in setting of hypotension, will treat if becomes
   tachycardic overnight
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.
   - hold aspirin pending improvement in platelets
   - hold beta blocker until hypotension resolved
   .
   # CHF: Known diastolic dysfunction. EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**] on admission.
   Mild evidence of CHF on exam.  No acute indication for HD
   - will monitor with volume resuscitation, will try IV lasix overnight

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and AFib who presents with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, concerning for sepsis. He has a pre-existing condition of CAD, CHF, and stage V kidney failure on HD. He is currently on T/T/S schedule and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly off baseline, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. AFib: The patient's AFib is not anti-coagulated, which can increase the risk of stroke and embolism.
4. CAD: The patient's CAD is not being treated with aspirin, which can increase the risk of MI and stroke.
5. CHF: The patient's CHF is not being aggressively managed, which can lead to worsening heart failure and increased risk of mortality.
6. Stage V Kidney Failure: The patient's kidney failure is not being adequately managed, which can lead to worsening kidney function and increased risk of mortality.
7. COPD: The patient's COPD is not being adequately managed, which can lead to worsening respiratory function and increased risk of mortality.
8. CVA: The patient's history of CVA increases the risk of recurrent stroke and cognitive decline.
9. Infections: The patient's infections, including the HD catheter-associated line infection, can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
10. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of bleeding complications increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
3. Consider anticoagulation therapy for AFib.
4. Restart aspirin and beta blocker therapy for CAD.
5. Aggressively manage CHF with IV lasix and diuretics as needed.
6. Monitor kidney function and adjust HD schedule as necessary.
7. Continue COPD therapy and consider non-invasive ventilation.
8. Monitor for signs of recurrent stroke and cognitive decline.
9. Monitor for signs of infection and bleeding complications.
10. Consider consultation with a nephrologist and pulmonologist to optimize management of kidney failure and COPD."

   Microbiology: -GPC seen in blood cultures overnight
   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with h/o A-fib and ESRD now on HD via catheter and admit
   with malaise and fatigue with febrile illness all concerning for
   catheter related infection.  He has required fluid bolus and with that
   has improved MAP and pressors have not been required.
   1)Sepsis-Concerning for catheter related blood stream infection which
   is well supported by blood culture results to date.  He has had
   improved hemodynamics with IVF bolus but has remained febrile within
   the last 24 hours.
   -Vanco/Levofloxacin
   -F/U blood culture
   -Would favor line change given sepsis and positive blood cultures but
   will have to be considered with Renal Team
   -IVF bolus as needed
   2)Hypoxemia--He does have sepsis as described above and is certainly at
   risk for non-cardigenic edema and acute lung injury.  In addition to
   this he does have clear witnessed aspiration event overnight as
   possible additional insult contributing to hypoxemia.
   2.5)Thrombocytopenia
Patient 200 at previous admission and now at 50.
   Will need clarification of heparin exposure to consider possible
   sources.
   -Check smear for possible clumping
   -Check of DIC labs
   -Will need to consider HIT if heparin exposure documented
no evidence
   of thombosis
   3)End Stage Renal Disease--
   -Will continue with dialysis as hemodynamics stabilized
   -Nephrocaps
   -Will need to discuss line change with renal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with h/o A-fib and ESRD now on HD via catheter and admit
   with malaise and fatigue with febrile illness all concerning for
   catheter related infection.  He has required fluid bolus and with that
   has improved MAP and pressors have not been required.
   1)Sepsis-Concerning for catheter related blood stream infection which
   is well supported by blood culture results to date.  He has had
   improved hemodynamics with IVF bolus but has remained febrile within
   the last 24 hours.
   -Vanco/Levofloxacin
   -F/U blood culture
   -Would favor line change given sepsis and positive blood cultures but
   will have to be considered with Renal Team
   -IVF bolus as needed
   2)Hypoxemia--He does have sepsis as described above and is certainly at
   risk for non-cardigenic edema and acute lung injury.  In addition to
   this he does have clear witnessed aspiration event overnight as
   possible additional insult contributing to hypoxemia.
   2.5)Thrombocytopenia
Patient 200 at previous admission and now at 50.
   Will need clarification of heparin exposure to consider possible
   sources.
   -Check smear for possible clumping
   -Check of DIC labs
   -Will need to consider HIT if heparin exposure documented
no evidence
   of thombosis
   3)End Stage Renal Disease--
   -Will continue with dialysis as hemodynamics stabilized
   -Nephrocaps
   -Will need to discuss line change with renal

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, suspected catheter-related blood stream infection, and end-stage renal disease. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on hemodialysis via catheter. The patient has been febrile, with a temperature of 101.1°F, and has required fluid boluses to improve hemodynamics. He has also experienced a witnessed aspiration event overnight and has developed hypoxemia. Laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 50, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Catheter-related blood stream infection: The patient's blood cultures are positive for GPC, and he has developed sepsis. A line change may be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to sepsis and possible aspiration. He may require further respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation, to improve oxygenation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Further evaluation, including a smear for possible clumping and DIC labs, is necessary to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient's kidney function is severely impaired, and he requires hemodialysis. His hemodynamics have stabilized, but he may require further management to prevent further complications.
5. Aspiration: The patient has experienced a witnessed aspiration event, which may increase the risk of pneumonia. A speech and swallow evaluation is necessary to determine the patient's risk of aspiration and to develop a plan to prevent further events.
6. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may cause organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, overweight/obese individual who was admitted to the ICU with a fever and chills. The patient had a dialysis catheter inserted on 09/06, but it was removed on 09/07 due to rigors and shivering, resulting in dropped blood pressures. The patient was treated with meropenem for proteus infection, which is resistant to antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.3°F (38.5°C)
* Heart rate: 94 bpm (86-135 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/61 mmHg (68-126/95 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (18-30 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 85%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.7 K/uL (4.7 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL (28.0 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 55 (65)
* Creatinine: 4.2 mg/dL (2.9 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 99 mg/dL (106 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, overweight/obese, anxious
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse and blood pressure
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, and clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and chills suggest a possible septic response, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Bacterial resistance: The patient's proteus infection is resistant to antibiotics, which can make treatment more challenging and increase the risk of treatment failure.
3. Dialysis catheter complications: The removal of the dialysis catheter may have caused bleeding or other complications, which need to be monitored and managed closely.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of cardiovascular instability.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's distended abdomen and altered bowel habits may indicate malnutrition or malabsorption, which can lead to further complications if not addressed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for sepsis. He had rigors and chills after his dialysis line was pulled yesterday, and is currently on vancomycin and levofloxacin for suspected sepsis. He is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and has a history of CAD, CHF, and CVA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of rigors and chills, as well as the growing GPC in clusters in his blood and proteus in his urine, suggest a high risk of sepsis. Continued monitoring of his vital signs, lab results, and antibiotic therapy will be necessary to manage this condition.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a likely cause. Further investigation and treatment will be necessary to address this condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled, but his anticoagulation status is unclear. Further evaluation and treatment will be necessary to manage this condition.
4. CHF: The patient's history of CHF and current symptoms of fatigue and hypotension suggest that his condition may be worsening. Close monitoring of his I/O status and electrolytes will be necessary to manage this condition.
5. CAD: The patient's history of CAD and current symptoms of fatigue and hypotension suggest that his condition may be worsening. Close monitoring of his cardiac status and electrolytes will be necessary to manage this condition.
6. CVA: The patient's history of CVA and current symptoms of weakness and fatigue suggest that his condition may be worsening. Close monitoring of his neurological status and electrolytes will be necessary to manage this condition.
7. Infection: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and rigors suggest that he may have an underlying infection. Further evaluation and treatment will be necessary to manage this condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 12, and start levophed to maintain MAP>65 if necessary.
2. Contact IR to pull HD tunnel line and replace on Mon/Tues.
3. Continue vancomycin and levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures return.
4. Trend WBC count, fever curve, and lactate.
5. Repeat CXR and sputum cx if possible.
6. Follow up with renal service for recommendations.
7. Perform heparin Ab labs.
8. Hold beta blocker and anticoagulation until after HD and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, and previous MI. He was admitted with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, concerning for sepsis. He had rigors and chills after his dialysis line was pulled, and his platelet count has decreased. He is currently on vancomycin and levofloxacin for suspected GPC and proteus infections. His CVP is 12, and his HCT is stable. He has a history of CAD, CHF, and CVA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, chills, and elevated lactate levels suggest sepsis. He is already on antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled, and sepsis can lead to organ failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a possible cause. This may lead to bleeding complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and he is not receiving anticoagulation. This may increase his risk of stroke or embolism.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's previous MI and CHF may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's COPD and potential OSA may increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
6. Infection: The patient's suspected GPC and proteus infections may not be fully controlled, and he may develop secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Bleeding Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications require close monitoring and management to prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, who
   presented with fatigue and found to have hypotension, elevated lactate,
   and tachypnea concerning for sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 Patient had rigors and chills after line was pulled
   yesterday. Did not respond to tylenol or ibuprofen. Mild improvement
   with fentanyl. Growing GPC in clusters in blood and proteus in urine.
   Currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin q48 hours. CVP
   of 12, HCT stable. Patient seems stable now, but was in septic [**Last Name (un) 5486**]
   last night. His response was very fast and with small ammount of fluid.
   However, fluids may be problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] on him since there is no HD access
   for now. The most likely source for indection was the HD line, and the
   fact that patient rigored after it was pulled strengthens the evidence.
   There is question of PNA on CXR, but it is not impressive.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 12-16, if still hypotensive can give
   RBCs and check central SVO2; and if needed start levophed to maintain
   MAP>65
   - If patient unstable, we will broaden coverage to include pseudomonas
   and posibly ESBL bacteria given patient E coli, proteus and multiple
   antibiotics treatments in the past
   - will contact IR to put HD tunnel line and replace on Mon or temporal
   line depending on cultures
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return and sensitivities to proteus
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   - f/u renal recs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          f/u renal for recommendations
   -          heparin Ab labs
   -          Transfuse plts if <20,000

   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled. CHADS2 2+
   -          holding beta blocker until after HD then reassess
   -          hold anticoagulation
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Will hold both until
   hypotension is under control and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - as above
   .
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary, but not likely due to septic physiology now.
   -optimize electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation, and a recent history of fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea. The patient presented with rigors and chills after the HD line was pulled, which suggests a possible source of infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.3°F (38.5°C), Heart rate 94 beats per minute (bpm), Blood pressure 94/61 mmHg, Respiratory rate 21 inspirations per minute (ipm), Oxygen saturation 85%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 6.7 K/uL, Hematocrit 29.7%, Platelet count 55 K/uL, Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL, Blood urea nitrogen 23 mg/dL, Glucose 99 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-nourished, with no acute distress, and has a CVP of 20 mmHg.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, and hypotension, are consistent with sepsis. The most likely source of infection is the HD line, and the patient is currently receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 55 K/uL, which is below the normal range. The possible causes of thrombocytopenia include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, HD itself, viral infection, or other drug-induced reactions.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and the patient is not receiving anticoagulation therapy.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is taking aspirin and beta blockers at home.
5. Chronic heart failure: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated.
6. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has Stage V kidney failure and is on HD.
7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient has a history of COPD and is taking tiotropium and albuterol.
8. History of cerebrovascular accident: The patient has a history of CVA with right-sided weakness.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

* Continuing IV fluids with a goal CVP of 12-16 mmHg, and considering RBC transfusions if the patient remains hypotensive.
* Broadening antibiotic coverage to include Pseudomonas and ESBL bacteria if the patient's condition worsens.
* Contacting IR to put a HD tunnel line and replace the current line.
* Continuing vancomycin and levofloxacin until the patient's blood and urine cultures return and sensitivities to proteus are known.
* Trending WBC count, fever curve, and lactate levels.
* Following up with repeat CXR and sputum CX if possible.
* Following up with renal recommendations and heparin Ab labs.
* Transfusing platelets if the patient's platelet count falls below 20,000 K/uL.
* Holding beta blockers and anticoagulation therapy until the patient's thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
* Optimizing electrolytes, monitoring I/O closely, and reassessing I/O goals post-HD.
* Continuing tiotropium and albuterol therapy, and considering a sleep consult.
* Holding ASA at this time until the patient's thrombocytopenia is fully worked up.
* Monitoring BP and electrolytes closely.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management to address the potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, who
   presented with fatigue and found to have hypotension, elevated lactate,
   and tachypnea with likely HD line sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 Patient with gram + cocci in clusters growing from HD line
   as well as from the blood in multiple cultures which is not yet
   speciated.  second culture grew through vancomycin. Patient had rigors
   and chills after line was pulled, which did not respond to tylenol or
   ibuprofen. Mild improvement with fentanyl. Also with proteus in urine.
   Currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin q48 hours. HCT
   stable, BP stable. There is question of PNA on CXR, but it is not
   impressive.
   - hold on additional IV fluids for now, goal CVP 12-16
   - If patient unstable, we will broaden coverage to include pseudomonas
   and posibly ESBL bacteria given patient E coli, proteus and multiple
   antibiotics treatments in the past
   - will contact IR to put temporal line for monday given that cultures
   are still positive and cannot have new tunnel line
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return and sensitivities to proteus
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          heparin Ab labs still pending
   - hold subQ heparin, use pneumoboots instead
   -          Transfuse plts if <10 or if < 50, 000 with signs of active
   bleeding
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled. CHADS2 2+
   -          restarted home better blocker yesterday afternoon
   -          would consider that this patient may benefit from
   anticoagulation for afib long term
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Holding aspirin
   until thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - hold ASA
   - restarted b-blocker [**9-8**]
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary, but not likely due to septic physiology now.
   -optimize electrolytes
   - goal while off HD to keep electrolytes even
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following.
   -      HD Monday, follow electrolytes
   -          -f/u electrolytes
   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - patient continues to refuse CPAP in house, will d/c order for it now
   - patient refuses nebs
   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up
   -monitor BP
   .
   # FEN: regular diet, check electrolytes post-HD, replete as needed

   Proteus grown out of urine which is resistant to ciprofloxacin so

   to most of the cephalosporins so changed patient to ceftriaxone and
   kept vanco for HD line.  Spoke with renal, plan for dialysis tomorrow
   morning. Would like to transfer him to the west side as now stable for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Proteus grown out of urine which is resistant to ciprofloxacin so
   suspect that also resistant to levofloxacin. Appears to be pansensitive
   to most of the cephalosporins so changed patient to ceftriaxone and
   kept vanco for HD line.  Spoke with renal, plan for dialysis tomorrow

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, and CAD who presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, likely due to HD line sepsis. He has gram-positive cocci in clusters growing from the HD line and blood cultures, which are not yet speciated. He has developed thrombocytopenia, likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and is being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin. He also has a history of CVA with R-sided weakness and is on aspirin, beta blocker, and warfarin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is worsening, with gram-positive cocci in clusters growing from the HD line and blood cultures, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which can lead to bleeding complications.
3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which can lead to bleeding complications and thrombotic events.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to heart failure and stroke.
5. CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen, leading to myocardial infarction and heart failure.
6. CHF: The patient's CHF may worsen, leading to pulmonary edema and heart failure.
7. COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and respiratory arrest.
8. CVA: The patient's CVA may worsen, leading to increased weakness and disability.
9. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vancomycin and levofloxacin to treat the HD line sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if it falls below 10,000.
3. Hold heparin and aspirin until the thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
4. Consider anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation long-term.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and consider optimizing them.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardioversion if necessary.
8. Consider transferring the patient to the floor once stable.
9. Monitor the patient's infection and consider adding antibiotics if necessary."

   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, who
   presented with fatigue and found to have hypotension, elevated lactate,

   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 Patient with gram + cocci in clusters growing from HD line
   as well as from the blood in multiple cultures which is not yet
   speciated.  second culture grew through vancomycin. Patient had rigors
   and chills after line was pulled, which did not respond to tylenol or
   ibuprofen. Mild improvement with fentanyl. Also with proteus in urine.
   Currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin q48 hours. HCT
   stable, BP stable. There is question of PNA on CXR, but it is not
   impressive.
   - hold on additional IV fluids for now, goal CVP 12-16
   - If patient unstable, we will broaden coverage to include pseudomonas
   and posibly ESBL bacteria given patient E coli, proteus and multiple
   antibiotics treatments in the past
   - will contact IR to put temporal line for monday given that cultures
   are still positive and cannot have new tunnel line
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return and sensitivities to proteus
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          heparin Ab labs still pending
   - hold subQ heparin, use pneumoboots instead
   -          Transfuse plts if <10 or if < 50, 000 with signs of active
   bleeding
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled. CHADS2 2+
   -          restarted home better blocker yesterday afternoon
   -          would consider that this patient may benefit from
   anticoagulation for afib long term
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Holding aspirin
   until thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - hold ASA
   - restarted b-blocker [**9-8**]
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, and CAD, who presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, likely due to HD line sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a blood pressure of 114/75 mmHg, with a CVP of 13 mmHg.
* Respiratory support includes oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 88%.
* Laboratory results show:
	+ White blood cell count: 6.7 K/uL
	+ Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 55 K/uL
	+ Creatinine: 4.2 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
	+ Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
	+ Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
	+ LDH: 276 IU/L
	+ Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
	+ Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
	+ Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
* The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, with a baseline platelet count of 92 K/uL on admission.
* The patient has atrial fibrillation, with a CHADS2 score of 2+, and is not currently anti-coagulated.
* The patient has CAD, with a history of MI, and is taking aspirin and a beta blocker at home.
* The patient has stage V kidney failure on HD, and is scheduled for HD on Monday.
* The patient has COPD, with a question of restrictive physiology on PFTs, and is asymptomatic.
* The patient has a history of CVA in 2017, with R-sided weakness.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's HD line sepsis is not yet fully treated, and there is a risk of further infection and septic shock.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of bleeding or further thrombocytopenia.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not currently anti-coagulated, and there is a risk of stroke or thromboembolism.
* CAD: The patient's CAD is a risk factor for further cardiac events, such as MI or stroke.
* Stage V kidney failure: The patient's kidney failure is a risk factor for further kidney damage or failure.
* COPD: The patient's COPD is a risk factor for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
* CVA: The patient's history of CVA is a risk factor for further cerebrovascular events.

The plan of care includes:

* Holding additional IV fluids for now, with a goal CVP of 12-16.
* Broadening coverage to include pseudomonas and possibly ESBL bacteria if the patient becomes unstable.
* Contacting IR to put a temporal line for Monday given that cultures are still positive and cannot have a new tunnel line.
* Continuing vancomycin and levofloxacin until the remainder of blood and urine cultures return and sensitivities to proteus are known.
* Trending WBC count, fever curve, and lactate.
* Following up with repeat CXR and sputum CX if possible.
* Holding subQ heparin and using pneumoboots instead.
* Transfusing plts if <10 or if <50,000 with signs of active bleeding.
* Restarting home beta blocker and considering anticoagulation for AFib long-term.
* Optimizing electrolytes and monitoring I/O closely, with HD and lasix as needed.
* Following up with renal service and electrolytes.
* Continuing to hold ASA until thrombocytopenia is fully worked up.
* Monitoring BP and holding ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully worked up."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD who presented with
   fatigue found to be hypotensive with MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis
   and proteus UTI initially improved by now with AMS and desat.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Desat - 7L+ LOS in patient with underlying diastolic dysfunction on
   HD. Much of this hypoxia is likely [**1-20**] refractory pulmonary edema/fluid
   overload in setting of removal of HD line as well as fluid
   recessutation for hypotension. Other possibilites include PE,
   aspiration pneumonitis vs pna. Currently, sats are in high 90s on
   non-rebreather.
   - aggressive diuresis diuril 500mg IV and lasix 100mg IV
   - maintain sats >90%
   - renal to touch base with IR re: HD line placement for HD today
   .
   #. AMS - Per chart review, the patient's baseline mental status is
   somewhat poor although his current state seems somewhat worse than his
   baseline.  This could likely be acute delirium superimposed on chronic
   dementia [**1-20**] hypoxia along with both his line infection and UTI. Other
   reasons for his AMS include: meds (ativan, abx), metabolic
   abnormalities, new or untreated infection, inctracranial pathology
   including hemorrhage. Would like to avoid head CT and/or LP as this
   patient has several conditions that explain his AMS and CT and LP would
   require sedation likely to the point of intubation, thereby exposing
   the patient to increased risks assoc with his care with likely low
   yield.
   - haldol 0.5-2 prn agitation
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid benzos due to concern for paradoxical agitation
   - consider head CT and/or LP if exam changes or mental status fails to
   improve over the next 24 hours
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Dysfunction
   - diuril and lasix as above
   - rate control with metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA line infection with bacteremia - HD catheter-associated line
   infection given positive tip culture [**9-7**] with MRSA and positive blood
   culture from [**9-8**]. 2 week treatment course began [**9-6**]. Recent
   surveillence cultures neg.
   - Central venous line in place, unable to get PIV
   - Continue vanc for 14 day course
   - continue to follow cultures
   - TTE to r/o endocarditis/valvular seeding
   .
   #. Proteus UTI - Complicated UTI in male requires 7 day treatment
   course. Initially treated with levofloxacin beginning on [**9-6**].
   - d/c Ctx 1 g q24 in favor of renally dosed ceftazadime
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline is mid-100s. Patient was at 92 on
   admission with INR at baseline of 1.3. DIC labs negative. Plts are
   currently 98 and stable. Heparin has been held due to concern for HIT.
   - f/u P4-Ab
   - continue to hold heparin and PPI/H-2 blockers/meds notorious for
   inducing thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Widened mediastinum on CXR
   - plan for CT to r/o aortic aneurysm
   .
   # AFib/FLUT: Not anti-coagulated. Currently in AFLUT. Held BB initially
   in settling of sepsis, resumed [**9-8**]. Rate is currently in the 120s in
   the setting of agitation and recent hypoxia.
   - metoprolol 5mg IV *3 for rate control with conversion to PO regimen
   upon improvement in his mental status
   - control agitation as above
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.
   - holding aspirin pending improvement in platelets
   .
   # Anemia: Likely chronic from renal disease
   - will monitor hct
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: On T/T/S schedule. HD tunnelled line
   removed on [**9-8**] in setting of MRSA line infection. Recently placed L AV
   fistula.
   - HD line placement this am followed by HD.
   - follow renal recommendations
   .
   # COPD: Most recent PFTs from [**2117**] showing restrictive dz, no clear
   COPD but low DLCO at that time. No wheezing on exam. Also h/o OSA but
   refuses CPAP. Does desat overnight in association w/ apnea.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn
   - ordered for CPAP overnight but refuses
   - likely to benefit from PFTs as outpt, pulm outpt f/u

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD who presented with fatigue, hypotension, MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis, and proteus UTI. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for his conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 104/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a high-flow neb. He is receiving oxygen therapy and is being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications.

The patient's physical examination is notable for his anxiety, diaphoresis, and absent radial pulses. His neurologic examination is normal, and his labs are within normal limits except for his white blood cell count, which is elevated.

The patient's conditions are:

1. MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis: The patient has a positive tip culture and blood culture, and is being treated with a 14-day course of vancomycin.
2. Proteus UTI: The patient has a complicated UTI and is being treated with a 7-day course of ceftazadime.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is being monitored for bleeding.
4. Acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction: The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and is being treated with diuretics and rate control medications.
5. AMS: The patient has altered mental status and is being treated with haloperidol and frequent reorientation.
6. Widened mediastinum on CXR: The patient has a widened mediastinum on his chest X-ray and is being evaluated for aortic aneurysm.

The patient's plan is to:

1. Continue antibiotics and diuretics for his sepsis and UTI.
2. Monitor his platelet count and bleeding risk.
3. Continue rate control medications for his diastolic dysfunction.
4. Continue haloperidol and frequent reorientation for his altered mental status.
5. Evaluate the patient's mediastinum further with a CT scan.
6. Place a new HD catheter and initiate HD therapy.
7. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust his medications as needed.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress put him at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of CAD and diastolic dysfunction put him at risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis and UTI put him at risk for further complications and organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy put him at risk for bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of ESRD and current treatment with HD put him at risk for further renal failure.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of CAD and diastolic dysfunction put him at risk for pulmonary embolism.
7. Stroke: The patient's history of CVA put him at risk for further stroke.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. He requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications and optimize his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD who presented with
   fatigue found to be hypotensive with MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis
   and proteus UTI initially improved by now with AMS and hypoxia.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypoxia - 7L+ LOS in patient with underlying diastolic dysfunction
   on HD. Much of this hypoxia is likely [**1-20**] refractory pulmonary
   edema/fluid overload in setting of removal of HD line as well as fluid
   recessutation for hypotension. Other possibilites include PE,
   aspiration pneumonitis vs pna. Currently, sats are in high 90s on
   non-rebreather.
   - aggressive diuresis diuril 500mg IV and lasix 100mg IV
   - maintain sats >90% (Will likely be able to achieve this without the
   need for emergent line placement and overnight HD as the risks to such
   procedures outweigh their benfits in this patient at the current time.)
   - will monitor for need for more emergent line placement and HD but
   otherwise will plan for am HD line placement and HD with goal - several
   liters
   .
   #. AMS - Per chart review, the patient's baseline mental status is
   somewhat poor although his current state seems somewhat worse than his
   baseline.  This could likely be acute delirium superimposed on chronic
   dementia [**1-20**] hypoxia along with both his line infection and UTI. Other
   reasons for his AMS include: meds (ativan, abx), metabolic
   abnormalities, new or untreated infection, inctracranial pathology
   including hemorrhage. Would like to avoid head CT and/or LP as this
   patient has several conditions that explain his AMS and CT and LP would
   require sedation likely to the point of intubation, thereby exposing
   the patient to increased risks assoc with his care with likely low
   yield.
   - haldol 0.5-2 prn agitation
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid benzos due to concern for paradoxical agitation
   - consider head CT and/or LP if exam changes or mental status fails to
   improve over the next 24 hours

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with fatigue, hypotension, and sepsis due to a MRSA HD catheter-associated infection and a Proteus UTI. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and diuretics, and is currently on a 7-day course of levofloxacin for the UTI.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has refractory pulmonary edema/fluid overload, which is likely contributing to his hypoxia. He is on non-rebreather oxygen therapy and is being treated with diuretics to manage his fluid overload.
* Neurological: The patient has acute mental status changes (AMS) and is at risk for further deterioration due to hypoxia, sepsis, and potential infections. He is being treated with haloperidol to manage agitation and is being monitored for signs of delirium.
* Cardiac: The patient has a history of acute diastolic dysfunction and is being treated with diuretics and metoprolol to manage his cardiac condition.
* Hematology: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is being monitored, and is at risk for further bleeding due to his platelet count.
* Infection: The patient has a MRSA line infection and a Proteus UTI, which are being treated with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's refractory pulmonary edema/fluid overload can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Sepsis: The patient's MRSA line infection and Proteus UTI can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's acute diastolic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia can increase his risk of cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he experiences further bleeding complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and potential acute kidney injury from the UTI can lead to renal failure if not managed properly.

In summary, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications due to his current condition, including respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac arrest, bleeding, and renal failure. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and manage his condition effectively to prevent these complications from occurring."
