   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo woman being transferred to MICU service for ongoing
   management of hypertension.  She is s/p coiling of R MCA aneurysm
   earlier this admission and has remained in the ICU on a labetolol gtt
   to maintain SBPs < 160.  Significant data include a persistent
   respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 in 50.  Torso CT yesterday with mod
   b/l pulmonary effusions and some evidence of volume overload.

Hypertension:
   -labetolol gtt in addition to ACE-I, ca channel blocker, and HCTZ
   -start transition to PO so can transition to the floor
   -clarify what target BP should be (no bleed prior to coiling)
Respiratory Acidosis:
   -looks like is chronic in nature
   -? underlying COPD
Cognition
   -AAOx3, clear
   Remainder of issues per ICU team.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for ongoing management of hypertension. She underwent coiling of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm earlier in her admission and has been receiving labetalol infusion to maintain systolic blood pressures below 160 mmHg. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 157/65 mmHg. She is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has a persistent respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 of 50 mmHg. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. She has been experiencing chronic respiratory acidosis, and there is a possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still above the target range, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis may progress to respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Sepsis: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes may indicate a risk of sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's volume overload and pulmonary effusions may increase her risk of pulmonary edema, which could worsen her respiratory status.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and hypertension may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's respiratory acidosis and volume overload may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's hypertension and aneurysm coiling may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo woman being transferred to MICU service for ongoing
   management of hypertension.  She is s/p coiling of R MCA aneurysm
   earlier this admission and has remained in the ICU on a labetolol gtt
   to maintain SBPs < 160.  Significant data include a persistent
   respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 in 50.  Torso CT yesterday with mod
   b/l pulmonary effusions and some evidence of volume overload.

Hypertension:
   -labetolol gtt in addition to ACE-I, ca channel blocker, and HCTZ
   -start transition to PO so can transition to the floor
   -clarify what target BP should be (no bleed prior to coiling)
Respiratory Acidosis:
   -looks like is chronic in nature
   -? underlying COPD
Cognition
   -AAOx3, clear
   Remainder of issues per ICU team.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for ongoing management of hypertension. She underwent coiling of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm earlier in the admission and has been receiving labetalol infusion to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 160 mmHg.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 157/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: labetalol infusion at 2 mg/min

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed
* Respiratory/chest: Crackles in breath sounds, diminished
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 208 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* Calcium: 9.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypertension: Continue labetalol infusion, transition to oral medications, and clarify target blood pressure.
* Respiratory acidosis: Chronic in nature, possibly related to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Cognition: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.
* ICU care: Nutrition, glycemic control, and line management are being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypertensive crisis: Systolic blood pressure remains above 160 mmHg, which may lead to cardiac complications.
* Respiratory failure: Chronic respiratory acidosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL, which may indicate an infection.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding prior to coiling, and the labetalol infusion may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and labetalol infusion may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient's coiling procedure and hypertension may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures."

   overload.

Hypertension:
   -labetolol gtt in addition to ACE-I, ca channel blocker, and HCTZ
   -start transition to PO so can transition to the floor
   -clarify what target BP should be (no bleed prior to coiling)
Respiratory Acidosis:
   -looks like is chronic in nature
   -? underlying COPD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the MICU for ongoing management of hypertension. She underwent coiling of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm earlier in the admission and has been receiving labetalol infusions to maintain systolic blood pressures (SBPs) below 160 mmHg.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 157/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Lab results:

* Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 208 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 38 mmol/L
* Electrolytes: Sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 97 mmol/L, bicarbonate 25.1 mmol/L
* Blood glucose: 102 mg/dL

Assessment and plan:

* Hypertension: The patient is being treated with labetalol infusions to maintain SBPs below 160 mmHg. The plan is to start transitioning to oral medications and eventually transition to the floor.
* Respiratory acidosis: The patient has a persistent respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 of 50. The underlying cause is suspected to be chronic in nature, possibly related to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Cognition: The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time (AAOx3).
* ICU care: The patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications:

* Hypertension: If not adequately controlled, hypertension can lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
* Respiratory acidosis: If not addressed, respiratory acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and increased risk of mortality.
* COPD: The patient's underlying COPD may exacerbate respiratory acidosis and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Volume overload: The patient's mod b/l pulmonary effusions and evidence of volume overload may increase the risk of cardiac complications, respiratory failure, and decreased renal function.
* DVT and VAP: The patient's prophylaxis for DVT and VAP is essential to prevent these complications, which can lead to serious health consequences, including pulmonary embolism and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a right internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that was coiled on [**2121-2-4**]. She was transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for blood pressure management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 166/64 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her neurological exam is stable, with no focal deficits, and she is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Right ICA aneurysm: She had a coiling procedure on [**2121-2-4**] and has a repeat head CT scan that shows no bleeding.
2. Hypertension: She has a prior history of hypertension and is currently on multiple medications, including labetalol, lisinopril, metoprolol, felodipine, and chlorthalidone.
3. Right parietal infarct: She has a new infarct that is likely secondary to the coiling procedure. She has a prior history of stroke with residual left-sided weakness.
4. Hypercarbia: She has respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, which may be related to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
5. Anemia: She has a slow trend of decreasing hemoglobin levels, which may be related to hematuria.
6. Thyroid disorder: She has low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and borderline thyroid hormone levels, which are consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome.
7. Urinary tract infection: Her urine culture is negative.
8. Hypercholesterolemia: She is not on outpatient statin therapy.
9. Depression: She is not on outpatient treatment.
10. Pain: She is receiving morphine IV prn.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 221 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Head CT scan: No bleeding or hemorrhage.
* Chest X-ray: Pending.

The patient's plan is to:

1. Wean off labetalol drip and assess blood pressure on oral medications.
2. Increase lisinopril to 40 mg qd.
3. Change metoprolol to labetalol 100mg QID.
4. Continue felodipine 10 mg qd.
5. Change HCTZ to chlorthalidone 50mg daily.
6. Continue ASA and plavix.
7. Monitor for hypercarbia and consider placing on BiPap as needed.
8. Perform outpatient pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
9. Discontinue levothyroxine.
10. Discontinue Ciprofloxacin.
11. Monitor and re-send if febrile or WBC elevated.
12. Consider outpatient statin therapy.
13. Continue morphine IV prn.
14. Replete electrolytes and provide regular diet.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still poorly controlled, and increasing the dose of antihypertensive medications may cause a hypertensive crisis.
2. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke and a new infarct, and the coiling procedure may have caused further damage to the brain.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, and the hypercarbia may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Infection: The patient's urine culture is negative, but she may still have an underlying infection that needs to be treated.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia may worsen if not properly managed, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen if not properly managed, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
8. Pain: The patient's pain may worsen if not properly managed, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female who was transferred from the SICU to the MICU for blood pressure management after undergoing coiling of a right ICA aneurysm. The patient has a history of hypertension, right pontine/caudate stroke with residual left-sided weakness, and is at risk for hypertensive complications.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (66-85 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 166/64 mmHg (98-127/80 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 25.1%
* Platelet count: 221 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* Calcium: 9.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient has a right parietal infarct, which is likely secondary to the coiling procedure. She has a history of respiratory acidosis and is at risk for further complications.

The patient's medications include:

* Labetalol drip
* Lisinopril 20 mg qd
* Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg TID
* Felodipine 10 mg qd
* HCTZ 25 mg qd
* ASA
* Plavix
* Morphine IV prn
* Famotidine
* Subcutaneous heparin

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning Labetolol drip and transferring to the floor once blood pressure control is achieved
* Increasing lisinopril to 40 mg qd
* Continuing Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg TID and uptitrating further if needed
* Continuing Felodipine 10 mg qd
* Continuing HCTZ 25 mg qd
* Discontinuing Metoprolol IV prn
* Monitoring blood pressure and adjusting medications as needed
* Consulting neurology to confirm blood pressure control and discuss acute infarct management
* Continuing to monitor acid-base status and considering outpatient PFTs
* Discontinuing leovthyroxine
* Monitoring and re-sending urine culture if febrile or WBC elevated
* Continuing morphine IV prn for pain management

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hypertensive crisis or encephalopathy
* Acute infarct expansion or hemorrhage
* Respiratory failure or acidosis
* Anemia or bleeding complications
* Thyroid storm or hypothyroidism
* Urinary tract infection or sepsis
* Hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis
* Depression or anxiety
* Pain management issues

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure, electrolyte levels, and acid-base status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female who was transferred to the MICU for ongoing management of hypertension. She has a significant medical history, including a recent coil procedure for a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 157/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 99%
* Weight: 76 kg (admission weight: 71.8 kg)

Lab results:

* Hemoglobin: 7.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 221 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 12.0/25.1/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 134/6/<0.01, Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.4 g/dL, Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

Assessment and plan:

* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with labetolol, and the plan is to transition her to oral medications to prepare her for discharge to the floor.
* Respiratory acidosis: The patient has a persistent respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 of 50, which may be chronic in nature and potentially related to underlying COPD.
* Cognition: The patient's cognitive function is impaired, with deficits in arousal, attention, and knowledge.
* Other issues: The patient has impaired balance, gait, and ventilation, and is experiencing chest pain, headache, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Hypertensive crisis or emergency: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of developing a hypertensive crisis or emergency.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis may progress to respiratory failure if not addressed.
* Infection: The patient's impaired immune function and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing an infection.
* Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and impaired circulation increase the risk of developing thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's impaired coagulation function and prolonged use of anticoagulant medications increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for management of hypertension after coiling of a right middle cerebral artery (R MCA) aneurysm. The patient has a history of hypertension and was previously taking medications to control his blood pressure. He was also taking antibiotics for an infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 157/62 mmHg, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% and his temperature is 36.3°C (97.4°F). The patient is receiving labetalol, an antihypertensive medication, through an infusion pump. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.4, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 221 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, despite treatment with labetalol. This may lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
2. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's chronic respiratory acidosis may worsen if not properly managed. This could lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient's history of infection and ongoing antibiotic treatment increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other complications.
4. Cerebral Edema: The patient's recent aneurysm coiling may have caused cerebral edema, which could lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's aneurysm coiling and hypertension may have caused neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, which could worsen his condition.
6. DVT: The patient's risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is increased due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions. This could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's risk of developing a stress ulcer is increased due to his critical illness and medication use. This could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his medication as needed to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory acidosis with oxygen therapy and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust his antibiotic treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely for signs of worsening cerebral edema or neurological complications.
5. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely for signs of stress ulceration and bleeding."
