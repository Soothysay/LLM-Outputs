   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .
   Access: Rt PICC placed [**1-1**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter UTI. He was transferred to the ICU for melanotic stools with a HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight. He has been resuscitated with 3 units of packed red blood cells and his HCT is now stable at 32.2. He is being empirically treated for c. diff with oral vancomycin and for CMV with ganciclovir IV. He has a known colitis with mucosal ulcerations and is being treated with pantoprazole 40 mg IV q12h.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient has had two episodes of melanotic stooling, and his HCT has dropped significantly. He may continue to bleed, and his HCT may drop further, leading to hypovolemic shock.
2. C. diff Colitis: The patient is being treated empirically for c. diff, but he may not respond to treatment, leading to worsening colitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, and he may develop recurrent endocarditis, which could be life-threatening.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may lead to stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular complications if not properly managed.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may lead to myxedema coma if not properly managed.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, which may lead to fractures if not properly managed.
8. Celiac Disease: The patient has severe, refractory celiac disease, which may lead to malnutrition and other complications if not properly managed.
9. Abdominal Pain: The patient has abdominal pain, which may be related to his colitis or other underlying conditions, and may lead to worsening colitis or other complications if not properly managed.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's HCT and blood pressure to ensure that he is not bleeding further.
2. Continue to treat the patient empirically for c. diff and CMV.
3. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and monitor his blood pressure.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with synthroid.
6. Continue to manage the patient's osteoporosis with home D2 and citracal.
7. Continue to manage the patient's celiac disease with gluten-free diet and TPN.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pain and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall individual with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, and atrial fibrillation. They were admitted to the ICU with a hematocrit of 21.3% and were started on ganciclovir, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. The patient had a PICC line inserted and underwent a nuclear medicine scan, which was negative for bleeding. The patient's hematocrit increased to 30.6% after receiving three units of blood and one liter of normal saline. The patient's heart rate remained persistently high, ranging from 100-130 beats per minute, and was treated with diltiazem for rate control.

The patient's physical examination revealed a thin and anxious individual with normal vital signs, except for a diminished radial pulse in both arms and diminished pedal pulses. The patient's abdomen was distended with hypoactive bowel sounds, and they had no rebound or guarding. The patient's skin was warm, and their neurologic examination was normal, except for muscle wasting.

Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 16.7, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 414 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes were within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. The patient's liver enzymes were mildly elevated, and their blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue, and further bleeding may occur. The patient's hematocrit is still low, and they may require further transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. The patient's antibiotic regimen may need to be adjusted to cover a possible infection.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as stroke or heart failure. The patient's heart rate remains persistently high, and further rate control measures may be necessary.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to their underlying medical conditions. The patient's oxygen saturation remains within normal limits, but further monitoring is necessary.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but further monitoring is necessary to detect any potential renal complications.
6. Neurologic Complications: The patient's muscle wasting may indicate a potential neurologic complication, such as muscular dystrophy. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to detect any potential neurologic complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt
   [**Name (NI) **] noted to have evolution of guaiac positive stools through day
   yesterday with stable PM HCT of 31.1 and subsequent melena overnight
   with passage of clots this morning and AM HCT of 21.4. Has known
   colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated empirically
   with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated for c. diff
   with oral vancomycin. Though he known causes for a lower GI bleed, the
   presence of melena is more suggestive.
   - Attempt to place additional IV access to assist in resuscitation
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse two units PRBC
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Bleeding scan to help localize location of bleeding
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt
   [**Name (NI) **] noted to have evolution of guaiac positive stools through day
   yesterday with stable PM HCT of 31.1 and subsequent melena overnight
   with passage of clots this morning and AM HCT of 21.4. Has known
   colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated empirically
   with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated for c. diff
   with oral vancomycin. Though he known causes for a lower GI bleed, the
   presence of melena is more suggestive.
   - Attempt to place additional IV access to assist in resuscitation
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse two units PRBC
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Bleeding scan to help localize location of bleeding
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple comorbidities. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for melanotic stools with a drop in HCT from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight.

The patient has experienced a GI bleed, which is being treated with pantoprazole, vitamin K, and transfusions. The patient has also been empirically treated for C. diff with oral vancomycin and for CMV with ganciclovir. The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea are being managed with ongoing GI consultation input.

The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin, and a past history of endocarditis, which increases the risk for recurrent endocarditis. The patient is scheduled for a TEE today.

The patient has also experienced RUE swelling, likely due to a right cephalic vein clot, and has been advised to eventually switch the PICC line to the left arm.

The patient's current medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to the GI bleed and the presence of melena. The patient's HCT is still low, and the patient may require further transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and is at risk for further infections, particularly in the setting of the GI bleed and the presence of indwelling lines.
3. Endocarditis: The patient has a past history of endocarditis and is at risk for recurrent endocarditis, particularly in the setting of the current bacteremia.
4. RUE swelling: The patient's RUE swelling is likely due to a right cephalic vein clot, and the patient may require further treatment to prevent further complications.
5. Abdominal pain and diarrhea: The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea may persist or worsen, particularly if the patient's underlying colitis is not adequately managed.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require further management, particularly if the patient's symptoms worsen.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may require further management, particularly if the patient's symptoms worsen or if the patient is at risk for further fractures.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, will consider flex sig
   if bleeds again.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h?
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple comorbidities, including MRSA bacteremia, colitis, and enterobacter UTI. He was recently transferred to the ICU for melanotic stools with a significant drop in hemoglobin (HCT) from 31.1 to 21.4. He was resuscitated with 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable with an HCT of 32.2.

The patient has ongoing GI bleed, which is being managed with empirical treatment for C. diff and colitis. He is also being treated for MRSA bacteremia and enterobacter UTI. He has a history of endocarditis, which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis, and an ID consult is recommending a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to monitor for any valvular vegetations.

The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with rate control medication. He has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis, and is being managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued GI bleed: The patient's ongoing GI bleed is a significant concern, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including MRSA bacteremia, enterobacter UTI, and possible C. diff colitis, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's history of endocarditis increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis, which could lead to valve damage, heart failure, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to stroke, heart failure, and increased risk of mortality if not managed properly.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could lead to decreased metabolism, increased risk of infection, and increased risk of mortality if not managed properly.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis could lead to fractures, decreased mobility, and increased risk of mortality if not managed properly.
7. Celiac disease: The patient's severe, refractory celiac disease could lead to malnutrition, decreased immune function, and increased risk of infection and mortality if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleed and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's infections with antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Schedule a TEE to monitor for any valvular vegetations and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medication and monitor for signs of stroke or heart failure.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement and monitor for signs of decreased metabolism or increased risk of infection.
6. Continue to manage the patient's osteoporosis with calcium and vitamin D supplements and monitor for signs of fractures or decreased mobility.
7. Continue to manage the patient's celiac disease with a gluten-free diet and monitor for signs of malnutrition or decreased immune function."

   85 yo male with history of celiac disease and now with recent findings

   transfer to ICU for further care.  We did pursue obtaining adequate IV
   access and then tagged RBC scan which failed to show source of bleeding
   and this in the setting of stabilization of HCT does suggest that acute
   and brisk bleeding has stopped but given production of maroon stool
   this morning ongoing bleeding is of concern.  This is, of course,
   clinical improvement in stability but does make identification of
   source of bleeding more challenging at this time.  With GI, IR and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of celiac disease who presented with a GI bleed and was transferred to the ICU for further care. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a stabilized HCT with 3 units of PRBC transfused.
* The patient has a history of allergies to gluten, augmentin, and unknown allergens.
* The patient is receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and vancomycin.
* The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 38°C, Tcurrent 38°C, HR 101 bpm, BP 128/64 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 99%.
* The patient has a heart rhythm of AF, and his physical examination is notable for a thin build, diminished breath sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen.
* Laboratory results show the following:
	+ Hct 21.3%
	+ WBC 16.7
	+ Plt 358
	+ Cr 0.9
	+ Glucose 109
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 13.0/26.0/1.1, ALT/AST 22/20, Alk Phos/T Bili 123/0.9, Differential-Neuts 85.2%, Lymph 8.4%, Mono 6.0%, Eos 0.3%, Ca++ 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.7 mg/dL, PO4 3.6 mg/dL
* Imaging studies, including a bleeding scan and CXR, have been negative for signs of bleeding or pulmonary infiltrates.
* The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia, UTI-enterobacter, and celiac disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Ongoing bleeding: Despite the patient's HCT stabilizing, the production of maroon stool suggests that bleeding may not have stopped, which could lead to further complications.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and UTI-enterobacter, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly treated.
3. Malnutrition: The patient has celiac disease and is receiving TPN, which could lead to malnutrition and related complications if not properly managed.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rhythm is AF, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and instability if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's diminished breath sounds and history of celiac disease could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

The patient's plan of care includes watchful waiting with continuation of current treatment, endoscopy, and ongoing monitoring of HCT. The patient will also continue to receive antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and UTI-enterobacter."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32 this AM.  Cdiff negative.  Pt
   has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. GI following.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct Q12H
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - d/c PO Vanc
   #. Urinary tract infection: Urinalysis and culture was drawn on
   [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising
   leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision
   hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on
   [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**], now on day 4)
   #. MRSA bacteremia: PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood
   cultures since admission have been without growth. PICC tip was sent
   for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth. TTE on
   [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not
   rule out small vegetations. Patient has a past history of endocarditis
   in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID
   consult recommending TEE.
   - TEE likely today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**] , now on
   day 16/indeterminant course)
   #. RUE swelling: Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
    #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with
   ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has returned negative for CMV, viral
   culture no growth to date. CMV viral load negative. Despite this will
   continue to treat for CMV with ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the
   ICU, patient had received a few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic
   dilation as a hearld for worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative
   for concerning changes. C. diff has been negative for 6 separate
   measures (last on [**2164-1-2**]).
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue IV ganciclovir, d/c PO Vanc. Ideally will switch to PO
   ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:  Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking
   gluten free medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - consider restarting metoprolol
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - consider restart Metoprolol with holding parameters, hold femlodipine
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple complications. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of melanotic stools and a recent drop in hemoglobin level from 31.1 to 21.4. He has been treated with 3 units of packed red blood cells and has a stable hemoglobin level of 32%.
2. Fever, unknown origin: The patient has had a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) for the past 24 hours, with no clear source of infection.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a history of enterobacter UTI, and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin IV.
4. MRSA bacteremia: The patient had a recent episode of MRSA bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin IV. Surveillance blood cultures have been negative for growth since admission.
5. RUE swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, likely due to a right cephalic vein clot.
6. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and colitis: The patient has a history of colitis, and recent flexible sigmoidoscopy has revealed ulcerations and colitis. He is currently being treated with ganciclovir IV.
7. Celiac disease: The patient has severe, refractory celiac disease, and is currently on TPN.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently being managed with rate control medications.
9. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with medication.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is currently being managed with synthroid.
11. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which is currently being managed with home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs and citracal + D.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to melanotic stools, Hct drop, and ongoing colitis of unknown etiology. He has been treated empirically with ganciclovir and oral vancomycin for suspected C. diff infection. The patient has also been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia, enterobacter UTI, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient has experienced a significant GI bleed, which may lead to further bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly C. diff, enterobacter, and MRSA, which may lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased mortality.
3. Colitis: The patient's colitis may worsen, leading to further bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
4. Endocarditis: The patient's history of endocarditis increases his risk of recurrent endocarditis, which may lead to further complications and increased mortality.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and increased mortality.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, leading to further symptoms and complications.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may worsen, leading to further fractures and complications.
8. Celiac disease: The patient's celiac disease may worsen, leading to further malnutrition, anemia, and complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleed and colitis closely, and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Consider performing a flexible sigmoidoscopy to evaluate the extent of the colitis and rule out other causes of bleeding.
3. Continue treatment for MRSA bacteremia and enterobacter UTI, and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Consider performing a TEE to evaluate for endocarditis and determine the length of treatment.
5. Continue treatment for atrial fibrillation, and monitor for signs of stroke, heart failure, and increased mortality.
6. Monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient's osteoporosis and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Continue treatment for celiac disease, and monitor for signs of malnutrition, anemia, and complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32 this AM.  Had brown stool
   today.  Cdiff negative.  Pt has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations
   which is being treated empirically with ganciclovir. GI following.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole at home dose, PO
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct Q12H
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - d/c PO Vanc
   #. Urinary tract infection: Urinalysis and culture was drawn on
   [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising
   leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision
   hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on
   [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**], now on day 4)
   #. MRSA bacteremia: PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood
   cultures since admission have been without growth. PICC tip was sent
   for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth. TTE on
   [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not
   rule out small vegetations. Patient has a past history of endocarditis
   in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID
   consult recommending TEE.
   - TEE likely today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**] , now on
   day 16/indeterminant course), hold tomorrow mornings dose and check a
   level given elevated level this AM
   #. RUE swelling: Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
    #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with
   ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has returned negative for CMV, viral
   culture no growth to date. CMV viral load negative. Despite this will
   continue to treat for CMV with ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the
   ICU, patient had received a few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic
   dilation as a hearld for worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative
   for concerning changes. C. diff has been negative for 6 separate
   measures (last on [**2164-1-2**]).
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue IV ganciclovir, d/c PO Vanc. Ideally will switch to PO
   ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:  Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking
   gluten free medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - restart metoprolol and d/c diltiazem (on home metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - restart Metoprolol with holding parameters, hold femlodipine
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of melanotic GI bleed and has been treated with ganciclovir empirically. The patient's Hct has dropped, and they have been resuscitated with 3 U PRBCs. The patient's stool has been brown today, and C. diff has been ruled out. The patient has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations, which is being treated empirically. Active type and screen are recommended.
2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Enterobacter, which was treated with ciprofloxacin IV. The patient's urine culture is pending, and ciprofloxacin will be continued for 7 days total.
3. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin IV. The patient's PICC line was removed, and surveillance blood cultures have been negative. The patient has a past history of endocarditis, which increases their risk for recurrent endocarditis.
4. RUE Swelling: The patient has RUE swelling likely due to a right cephalic vein clot. No anticoagulation is indicated at this time for a superficial vein clot.
5. Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea/Colitis: The patient has abdominal pain, diarrhea, and colitis caused by unknown etiology. The patient has undergone flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with significant celiac disease and ulcerating lesions noted
   in the colon we have patient admitted with GI bleed concerning for
   lower source.  Importantly bleeding appears to have slowed
   substantially and we have seen an increasing difficulty in capacity to
   identify source.  We have coordinated plan with GI and surgery and IR
   and will currently continue to monitor HCT and consider flexible
   sigmoidostomy vs. bleeding scan for any recurrent evidence of bleeing.
   We will have to consider treatment for CMV as reasonable across time
   given concern for contribution to ulcerating lesions.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with a GI bleed, concerning for a lower source. The bleeding has slowed substantially, but the source is still unclear. The patient has a history of celiac disease, ulcerating lesions in the colon, and is at risk for CMV infection. Current medications include Augmentin, Gancyclovir, Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Pantoprazole, and Protonix. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a PICC line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleed has slowed, but it is still unclear what the source is. Further monitoring and evaluation are needed to identify the cause and prevent further bleeding.
2. CMV infection: The patient is at risk for CMV infection, which could contribute to the ulcerating lesions in the colon. Monitoring for signs of CMV infection and considering treatment if necessary is important.
3. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which needs to be treated with Ciprofloxacin.
4. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has MRSA bacteremia, which needs to be treated with Vancomycin. Further evaluation with a TEE is needed to assess for vegetations.
5. Celiac disease: The patient has celiac disease, which needs to be managed with a gluten-free diet. The patient is currently receiving TPN, which needs to be continued.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration, which needs to be managed with PPI therapy.
7. DVT prophylaxis: The patient needs DVT prophylaxis with boots.
8. Glycemic control: The patient needs close monitoring of his glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
9. VAP prophylaxis: The patient needs VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleed and source, and consider flexible sigmoidoscopy or bleeding scan if necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with Ciprofloxacin.
3. Continue to treat the patient's MRSA bacteremia with Vancomycin.
4. Continue to manage the patient's celiac disease with a gluten-free diet and TPN.
5. Continue to manage the patient's stress ulcer with PPI therapy.
6. Continue to provide DVT prophylaxis with boots.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to provide VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."
