   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TTE this AM
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-myocardial infarction with aortic valve replacement (AVR), and thrombocytopenia. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Encephalopathic state: The patient has been encephalopathic all night, with complaints of thirst and had multiple bowel movements. He has poor attention span and cannot always finish a train of thought when speaking in sentences.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, with a history of easy bleeding and bruising.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he has required pressor support.
4. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his current ECG shows atrial flutter.
5. Elevated troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, likely due to hypotension secondary to infection.
6. Elevated CK: The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, likely due to hypotension and metabolic demands.
7. Infection: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, and there is concern for endovascular source of infection given his history of AVR.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high-grade bacteremia and labile blood pressure put him at risk for sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia and history of AVR increase his risk for endocarditis.
3. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of easy bleeding and bruising increase his risk for thrombotic complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and fluid overload put him at risk for renal failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and fluid overload put him at risk for respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's encephalopathic state and elevated troponin levels increase his risk for neurological complications.

The plan of care for the patient includes:

1. Treatment of bacteremia with antibiotics.
2. Management of hypotension with vasopressors and diuretics.
3. Monitoring of troponin and CK levels.
4. Echocardiogram to evaluate left ventricular function and valvular dysfunction.
5. Repeat head computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for septic emboli.
6. Consideration of repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for endocarditis.
7. Monitoring of platelet count and consideration of platelet transfusions.
8. Monitoring of renal and respiratory function.
9. Consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TTE this AM
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TTE this AM
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic thrombocytopenia, who was transferred to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He has a high-grade bacteremia, and there is concern for endovascular source of infection, possibly endocarditis. He is volume overloaded, with elevated jugular venous pressure and central venous pressure. He has a mixed picture of sepsis and heart failure, and his pressor requirements have decreased since starting diuresis. He has pulled out his pulmonary artery catheter and central line.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis. He is already showing signs of sepsis, including encephalopathy, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has a bioprosthetic aortic valve, and there is concern for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to evaluate for vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic systolic heart failure, which is exacerbated by his bacteremia and volume overload.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, which may be related to his infection or underlying medical conditions.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient has encephalopathic symptoms, which may be related to his infection, metabolic derangements, or sedative use.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his heart failure, bacteremia, and potential for sepsis.

Plan:

1. Continue to treat the patient's bacteremia with antibiotics, including switching to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA.
2. Continue diuresis with Lasix to manage the patient's volume overload.
3. Taper dopamine and wean the patient off pressors.
4. Perform a TEE to evaluate for endocarditis and assess the patient's valvular function.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider further evaluation for thrombocytopenia.
6. Hold sedating medications and consider repeat Head CT or MRI to evaluate for septic emboli.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. By Duke Criteria - he has major
   criteria of high gradebacteremia with typical organism, by minor
   criteria he has fever, predisposing heart condition, he also has skin
   findings of petechiae however difficult to interpret in the setting of
   significant thrombocytopenia.
   - Will continue Vancoymcin dosed 1 gm Q 12
   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] OSH micro lab - SA is likely MSSA but sensitivities are not
   finalized, will fax results in am - if so, plan to transition to
   nafcillin
   - TEE given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - ID consult in am given high grade Staph aureus bacteremia
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   - Consider hematology consult in am
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter however this is in the setting of
   pressors
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

The patient's 24-hour events are notable for encephalopathic symptoms all night, complaints of thirst, and frequent bowel movements. The patient received lasix boluses and a lasix drip, but urinary output did not change. Dopamine was turned off at 3 am but restarted due to MAPs in the mid-50s. The patient pulled out their Swan-Ganz catheter and central line this morning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 19 inspirations per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 60-66%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 43. The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.20 ng/mL, and their creatinine level is 2.0 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's diagnosis is complicated by the presence of bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient is at high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis, and may require further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and hypotension put them at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia and atrial fibrillation increase their risk for developing endocarditis.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure may worsen, leading to cardiac failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further cognitive decline.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient's volume overload and elevated PCWP increase their risk for developing pulmonary edema.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output increase their risk for developing renal failure.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing vancomycin and lasix, obtaining surveillance blood cultures, and considering further evaluation and treatment for endocarditis. The patient will also require close monitoring for signs of sepsis, cardiac failure, and thrombocytopenia."

   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed

   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows

   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV

   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - heme consult
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent CABG with aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was transferred to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.7°C, Tcurrent 37.1°C, HR 97 bpm, BP 97/54 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: PCWP 32, CVP 14-24, JVP elevated.
* Fluid balance: Total in 2,208 mL, total out 3,780 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,572 mL.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device none, SpO2 100%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 7.7, Hct 34.6, Plt 43.
	+ Electrolytes: Na 130 mg/dL, K 2.2 mg/dL, Cl 26 mEq/L, PO4 4.1 mg/dL.
	+ Blood cultures: 4/4 bottles growing Staphylococcus aureus.
	+ Troponin-T 0.20, TCO2 21, Glucose 156 mg/dL.
	+ Other labs: PT 16.3, PTT 33.5, INR 1.4, CK 277, CKMB 6, ALT 59, AST 92, Alk Phos 39, T Bili 1.7, LDH 415 IU/L, Ca++ 7.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.6 mg/dL, Albumin 2.4 g/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated PCWP and CVP suggest a high risk of sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's bioprosthetic aortic valve and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus suggest a high risk of endocarditis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, endocarditis, or a combination of both.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology may be exacerbated by his current condition.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state may be due to toxic or metabolic causes related to his infection.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest a high risk of renal failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated PCWP and CVP suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, combined with his current condition, may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of easy bleeding and bruising, combined with his thrombocytopenia, may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's plan of care should include:

1. Aggressive treatment of his bacteremia and endocarditis with antibiotics and antifungal agents.
2. Close monitoring of his hemodynamic status, including PCWP and CVP.
3. Tapering of dopamine and lasix to prevent hypotension.
4. Treatment of his thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and further evaluation of its etiology.
5. Management of his encephalopathic state with sedation and antibiotics.
6. Monitoring of his renal function and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
7. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and consideration of non-invasive ventilation.
8. Cardiac monitoring and consideration of anti-arrhythmic medications.
9. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors and consideration of anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - heme consult
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and prosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2164**]. He was transferred to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's condition has been complicated by the following:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, and the possibility of endocarditis is high, given the presence of a bioprosthetic aortic valve.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, which could be due to sepsis, worsening aortic valvular function, or volume overload.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, which is not related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
4. Encephalopathy: The patient is encephalopathic, likely due to toxic or metabolic causes related to infection.
5. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has evidence of volume overload, which is being managed with diuretics.
6. Elevated CK/Troponin: The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) and troponin levels, which are likely due to hypotension and demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
7. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, which is being managed with medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening endocarditis: The patient's condition could deteriorate if the infection is not adequately treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure could worsen if not adequately managed.
4. Thrombotic events: The patient's thrombocytopenia could increase the risk of thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Neurological sequelae: The patient's encephalopathy could lead to long-term neurological damage or disability.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue treatment for endocarditis with nafcillin, and consider adding gentamicin and rifampin if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular function closely, and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Continue diuretic therapy to manage volume overload.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment for thrombocytopenia as needed.
5. Consider repeating Head CT and MRI to evaluate for septic emboli.
6. Hold sedating medications and consider stress dose steroids for the patient's encephalopathy.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider adding beta blockers and ACE inhibitors once the patient's blood pressure allows.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve his condition."

   Chief Complaint: Endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   - PA catheter self-DCed by pt this AM , so dopamine and lasix gtt had
   been off and patient's BPs in 80s systolic, restarted once IV placed
   another peripheral ; lasix gtt restarted 12:30pm (~-1200cc since
   midnight by that time)
   - TTE: suboptimal image quality, TEE for further eval recommended,
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Thickened aortic valve bioprosthesis
   with high-than-normal transvalvular gradients but no significant
   regurgitation. Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - ID recs - MRI head, agree likely endocarditis, will treat for
   endocarditis. Nafcillin for now. If TEE positive will likely add gent
   for 2 weeks and rifampin for 6 weeks and nafcillin for 6 weeks.
   - call OSH and add rifampin to sensitivities - done

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   been off and patient's BPs in 80s systolic, restarted once IV placed
   another peripheral ; lasix gtt restarted 12:30pm (~-1200cc since
   midnight by that time)
   - TTE: suboptimal image quality, TEE for further eval recommended,
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Thickened aortic valve bioprosthesis
   with high-than-normal transvalvular gradients but no significant
   regurgitation. Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - ID recs - MRI head, agree likely endocarditis, will treat for
   endocarditis. Nafcillin for now. If TEE positive will likely add gent
   for 2 weeks and rifampin for 6 weeks and nafcillin for 6 weeks.
   - call OSH and add rifampin to sensitivities - done

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TTE this AM
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a bioprosthetic valve. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.7°C (99.8°F), Heart rate 97 beats per minute (bpm), Blood pressure 97/54 mmHg, Respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 100%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a systolic ejection murmur radiating to the carotid, and his peripheral vascular examination is normal except for diminished radial and dorsalis pedis pulses.
* Respiratory: The patient has crackles in his lungs and bronchial breath sounds laterally.
* Abdominal: The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.
* Neurologic: The patient is responding to verbal stimuli, but his movement, tone, and orientation are not assessed.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 29,000 cells per microliter (K/uL), platelet count is 43,000 cells per microliter, and creatinine level is 2.0 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and high-grade fever put him at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's bioprosthetic aortic valve and history of CAD make him susceptible to developing endocarditis.
3. Heart failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing his risk of bleeding.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state may worsen, leading to increased risk of septic emboli.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory examination suggests that he may be at risk for developing respiratory failure.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and potential sepsis may lead to kidney injury.

The patient's plan of care should include:

1. Antibiotic therapy: The patient should continue to receive antibiotic therapy for his bacteremia and potential endocarditis.
2. Cardiovascular support: The patient should receive cardiovascular support, including diuretics and vasopressors, to manage his heart failure and potential sepsis.
3. Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's hemodynamic status should be closely monitored to detect any changes in his condition.
4. Laboratory monitoring: The patient's laboratory results should be closely monitored to detect any changes in his kidney function, liver function, or platelet count.
5. Neurologic monitoring: The patient's neurologic status should be closely monitored to detect any changes in his encephalopathic state.
6. Respiratory support: The patient should receive respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation, to manage his respiratory failure.
7. Kidney protection: The patient should receive kidney protection measures, including hydration and diuretics, to prevent kidney injury."

   24 Hour Events:
   TEE performed today, showed small vegetation on aortic valve.
   - ortho consulted concerning red right elbow, they stated unlikely to
   be septic joint, would not tap.
   - consulted renal - for hematuria, low complement, [**Last Name (un) **]; unclear
   etiology at this time, recommended sending ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **], getting renal
   ultrasound with doplers.
   - consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] - no surgical intervention indicated at this time,
   (nurse practitioner).
   - consulted heme/onc - unclear etiology for leukopenia,
   thrombocytopenia - consider SLE, MDS, marrow suppression in setting of
   sepsis.  Most likely is sepsis.  Can start G-CSF if leukopenia becomes
   <500. Recommend ultrasound of liver/spleen for septic emboli.
   -CT head - Small hyperdensity at the left frontal lobe which may
   reflect an occult vascular malformation. A focus of infarction is
   unlikely.
   -given 500cc NS - patient has been hypotensive and elevation of

   cholecystitis, although acalculous cholecystitis possible in setting of
   critical illness.  Also look for obstructing mass.
   - fractionate bilis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - appreciate heme recs.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint: Endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   TEE performed today, showed small vegetation on aortic valve.
   - ortho consulted concerning red right elbow, they stated unlikely to
   be septic joint, would not tap.
   - consulted renal - for hematuria, low complement, [**Last Name (un) **]; unclear
   etiology at this time, recommended sending ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **], getting renal
   ultrasound with doplers.
   - consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] - no surgical intervention indicated at this time,
   (nurse practitioner).
   - consulted heme/onc - unclear etiology for leukopenia,
   thrombocytopenia - consider SLE, MDS, marrow suppression in setting of
   sepsis.  Most likely is sepsis.  Can start G-CSF if leukopenia becomes
   <500. Recommend ultrasound of liver/spleen for septic emboli.
   -CT head - Small hyperdensity at the left frontal lobe which may
   reflect an occult vascular malformation. A focus of infarction is
   unlikely.
   -given 500cc NS - patient has been hypotensive and elevation of
   creatinine, likely over-diuresed.

   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Continue nafcillin given aortic vegetation
   - confer with ID concerning gent/rifampin dosing.
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs

   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) in 2014. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of endocarditis, bacteremia, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient has a small vegetation on his aortic valve, as seen on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). He has been treated with nafcillin, and the antibiotic regimen is being adjusted based on the patient's response.

The patient has several comorbidities, including thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and acute kidney injury. He has a mixed picture of hypotension, with a PCWP of 32 and a CVP of 14-24, which may be due to sepsis or worsening aortic valvular function.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukopenia with a WBC count of 7.7
* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 43
* Hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 36.5%
* Elevated creatinine with a value of 2.7 mg/dL
* Elevated lactate with a value of 1.8 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A small hyperdensity on the left frontal lobe on CT head, which may reflect an occult vascular malformation
* A small mobile echodensity on the aortic bioprosthetic valve on TEE, consistent with a small vegetation

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening aortic valvular function and heart failure
* Development of septic emboli, particularly to the liver and spleen
* Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis
* Encephalopathy and potential for septic emboli to the brain

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotic therapy for endocarditis
* Monitoring for evidence of valvular aortic insufficiency or hemodynamic compensation
* Adjusting the antibiotic regimen based on the patient's response
* Treating hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis
* Managing thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Monitoring for signs of septic emboli and encephalopathy
* Considering MRI to better characterize the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Continue nafcillin given aortic vegetation
   - confer with ID concerning gent/rifampin dosing.
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - neo as needed.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   # Acute Kidney injury
 may be pre-renal currently due to poor forward
   flow, although urine WBCs suggest potentially AIN.  No red cell casts
   that would be consistent with glomerulonephritis.
   -          trend creatinine
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Follow up anca/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 will acquire RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for
   cholecystitis, although acalculous cholecystitis possible in setting of
   critical illness.  Also look for obstructing mass.
   - fractionate bilis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - appreciate heme recs.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a small vegetation on the aortic valve, which is a complication of endocarditis. This increases the risk of further complications, such as valve damage, embolization, and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis. The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest that sepsis is already present.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient has a mixed picture of AKI, which may be pre-renal due to poor forward flow or potentially due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.
5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be due to cholecystitis, acalculous cholecystitis, or obstructing mass.
6. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in atrial flutter, which increases the risk of stroke and embolization.
7. Elevated CK/Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin levels may be due to hypotension secondary to infection, which increases the risk of cardiac damage.
8. Encephalopathy: The patient has a toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, which may be due to infection, sedatives, or other metabolic factors.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support requires close monitoring, as they may develop respiratory failure or other complications.
10. Hematological Complications: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia and elevated LFTs/LDH levels increase the risk of bleeding, bruising, and other hematological complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these complications, including antibiotics, diuresis, pressor support, and other interventions to address the underlying infections and organ dysfunction."

   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing

   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine

   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry

   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows

   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   TEE performed today, showed small vegetation on aortic valve.
   - ortho consulted concerning red right elbow, they stated unlikely to
   be septic joint, would not tap.
   - consulted renal - for hematuria, low complement, [**Last Name (un) **]; unclear
   etiology at this time, recommended sending ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **], getting renal
   ultrasound with doplers.
   - consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] - no surgical intervention indicated at this time,
   (nurse practitioner).
   - consulted heme/onc - unclear etiology for leukopenia,
   thrombocytopenia - consider SLE, MDS, marrow suppression in setting of
   sepsis.  Most likely is sepsis.  Can start G-CSF if leukopenia becomes
   <500. Recommend ultrasound of liver/spleen for septic emboli.
   -CT head - Small hyperdensity at the left frontal lobe which may
   reflect an occult vascular malformation. A focus of infarction is
   unlikely.
   -given 500cc NS - patient has been hypotensive and elevation of
   creatinine, likely over-diuresed.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2164**]. He was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by endocarditis, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (PLT)
* Elevated troponin-T and creatine kinase (CK) levels
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels
* Abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, and chloride

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A small mobile echodensity on the aortic bioprosthetic valve consistent with a small vegetation on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
* A small hyperdensity at the left frontal lobe on computed tomography (CT) head, which may reflect an occult vascular malformation

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Endocarditis
* Sepsis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter
* Elevated CK/Troponin
* Encephalopathy

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Endocarditis-related complications, such as valve dysfunction or abscess formation
* Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding or hemorrhage
* Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure-related complications, such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter-related complications, such as stroke or systemic embolism
* Elevated CK/Troponin-related complications, such as cardiac ischemia or infarction
* Encephalopathy-related complications, such as septic emboli or cerebral edema

Plan:

* Continue antibiotics for endocarditis and sepsis
* Monitor for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Monitor for signs of endocarditis-related complications
* Monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia-related bleeding or hemorrhage
* Continue diuresis for acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Continue nafcillin given aortic vegetation
   - confer with ID concerning gent/rifampin dosing.
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - neo as needed.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   # Acute Kidney injury
 may be pre-renal currently due to poor forward
   flow, although urine WBCs suggest potentially AIN.  No red cell casts
   that would be consistent with glomerulonephritis.
   -          trend creatinine
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Follow up anca/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 will acquire RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for
   cholecystitis, although acalculous cholecystitis possible in setting of
   critical illness.  Also look for obstructing mass.
   - fractionate bilis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - appreciate heme recs.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 will acquire RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for
   cholecystitis, although acalculous cholecystitis possible in setting of
   critical illness.  Also look for obstructing mass.
   - fractionate bilis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - appreciate heme recs.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p coronary artery bypass grafting with aortic valve replacement, and thrombocytopenia.
* He was transferred to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
* The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, which is concerning for endovascular source of infection, possibly endocarditis.
* He has a mixed picture of hypotension, with a PCWP of 32 and CVP of 14-24, which may be due to sepsis, worsening aortic valvular function, or distributive shock.
* The patient has acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal or due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).
* He has hyperbilirubinemia, which may be due to cholecystitis or acalculous cholecystitis.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is chronic and of unclear etiology, and may be due to infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency, or drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
* He has atrial fibrillation/flutter, which is rate-controlled.
* The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) and troponin levels, which are likely due to hypotension and demand ischemia.
* He has encephalopathy, which is likely due to toxic/metabolic causes and may be related to sedative medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Endocarditis
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Cholecystitis or acalculous cholecystitis
* Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter-related complications
* Encephalopathy-related complications
* Worsening of underlying chronic systolic heart failure
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

The patient's management plan includes:

* Continued treatment of bacteremia with nafcillin and consideration of gentamicin and rifampin
* Monitoring of blood cultures and surveillance for sepsis
* Management of hypotension with fluid challenge and vasopressors as needed
* Treatment of acute kidney injury with diuresis and consideration of renal replacement therapy
* Monitoring of liver function tests and consideration of cholecystectomy if cholecystitis is confirmed
* Management of thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and consideration of HIV testing and B12/folate supplementation
* Monitoring of atrial fibrillation/flutter and consideration of anticoagulation therapy
* Management of encephalopathy with sedation reduction and consideration of Head CT and MRI scans
* Monitoring of glycemic control and nutrition
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Monitoring of VAP and consideration of respiratory therapy as needed."

   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of
   infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the
   patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given
   his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of
   [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation but may need to switch to Vanc
   in setting of possible AIN
   - has not started Gent due to worsening renal function
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension -  appears to be in Distributive shock.  Neo weaned off
   with fluid challenge last night but restarted early this AM.  AM
   cortisol yesterday normal.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.  Holding diuresis
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - will fluid challenge very slowly and gently today
   - consider Swan tomorrow to help w fluid management if not improving
   - continue phenylephrine and attempting to wean
   # Acute Kidney injury
 Multifactorial, may be pre-renal currently due
   to poor forward flow, in addition to AIN as suggested by urine WBCs.
   Possibly also contribution of immune-mediated complexes.
   - may need to switch Nafcillin to Vancomycin in setting of AIN
   -          trend creatinine
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Follow up anca/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP
   - Rheumatology consult to consider restarting steroids
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now
   or mildly positive with fluid challenges.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was

   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-cardiac bypass surgery, and thrombocytopenia. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Bacteremia/Endocarditis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, and a vegetation on his bioprosthetic aortic valve. He is at high risk for complicated bacteremia and endocarditis.
2. Hypotension: The patient is in distributive shock, and his blood pressure is difficult to control. He has been weaned off the pressors, but restarted due to worsening hypotension.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has multifactorial acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal, due to poor forward flow, and possibly also due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).
4. Rash: The patient has a diffuse petechial rash on his back, which is of unknown etiology. It may be related to vasculitis or chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
5. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of volume overload, and his blood pressure is difficult to control. He is at risk for further cardiac complications.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has increased direct bilirubin, which may be related to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, and his platelet count is low. He has a history of easy bleeding and bruising.
8. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but no documented history of this. He is currently in atrial flutter, and his heart rate is controlled.
9. Encephalopathy: The patient has a toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, which is likely related to his infection. He is currently receiving olanzapine for agitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
2. Endocarditis-related complications, such as valve destruction or embolization
3. Acute kidney injury progression to chronic kidney disease
4. Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding complications
5. Atrial fibrillation-related complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest
6. Encephalopathy-related complications, such as seizures or coma
7. Hypotension-related complications, such as organ dysfunction or failure
8. Hyperbilirubinemia-related complications, such as jaundice or liver dysfunction
9. Rash-related complications, such as vasculitis or skin necrosis

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical complications closely, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the
   patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given
   his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of
   [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation but may need to switch to Vanc
   in setting of possible AIN
   - has not started Gent due to worsening renal function
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs

   # Hypotension -  appears to be in Distributive shock.  Neo weaned off
   with fluid challenge last night but restarted early this AM.  AM
   cortisol yesterday normal.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.  Holding diuresis
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - will fluid challenge very slowly and gently today
   - consider Swan tomorrow to help w fluid management if not improving
   - continue phenylephrine and attempting to wean
   # Acute Kidney injury
 Multifactorial, may be pre-renal currently due
   to poor forward flow, in addition to AIN as suggested by urine WBCs.
   Possibly also contribution of immune-mediated complexes.
   - may need to switch Nafcillin to Vancomycin in setting of AIN

   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-myocardial infarction, and aortic valve replacement. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He has a high-grade bacteremia, and there is concern for endocarditis. The patient has a petechial rash on his back, which is unknown in etiology. He has acute kidney injury, possibly multifactorial, and is at risk for complicated bacteremia. He is also experiencing hypotension, which is thought to be distributive in nature, and has a history of thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, and there is concern for endocarditis, which could lead to further complications, such as septic emboli, heart failure, and death.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, which could progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis, and increasing the risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure, and increase the risk of sepsis and death.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of endocarditis, and may require platelet transfusions.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy could progress to coma, and increase the risk of long-term cognitive impairment and disability.
6. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia could lead to sepsis, which could increase the risk of organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and hepatic failure, and death.
7. End-organ damage: The patient's bacteremia could lead to end-organ damage, such as kidney, liver, and heart damage, which could increase the risk of long-term complications and disability.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for endocarditis and bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's hypotension with fluid challenges and vasopressors, as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
5. Consider MRI to evaluate for septic emboli.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider sedation and analgesia as necessary.
7. Consider rheumatology consult to evaluate the patient's petechial rash and consider restarting steroids.
8. Consider cardiology consult to evaluate the patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure and consider beta-blocker and ACE-I therapy."

 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of MSSA bacteremia
   and acute on chronic systolic CHF c/b hypotension
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus at OSH. Concern for endovascular source
   of infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as
   the patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms.
   Given his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms
   of [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve as witness on
   TEE.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no
   new murmur, pulse pressure widening, EKG QRS prolongation)
   - appreciate CSurg recs
   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   - TTE
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine lytes
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above. Required lasix last night for likely pulmonary
   edema.
   - consider PA catheter
   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was

   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # other

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a past medical history of CAD, s/p CABG with AVR, and thrombocytopenia. He was transferred to the ICU for management of MSSA bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 36.6°C, HR 109 bpm, BP 91/53 mmHg, RR 23 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Cardiovascular: Patient has a mixed picture of distributive and cardiac shock, with a widened pulse pressure and a murmur suggestive of aortic insufficiency.
* Respiratory: Patient has bilateral pulmonary edema and is on oxygen therapy.
* Renal: Patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to AIN, with a BUN/Cr ratio of 20:1.
* Hematological: Patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to chronic ITP, with a platelet count of 43,000/μL.
* Infectious: Patient has MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis, with a vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve.
* Neurological: Patient has encephalopathy, likely due to infection or toxic/metabolic causes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and endocarditis can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve can lead to endocarditis, which can cause further cardiac complications.
3. Aortic insufficiency: The patient's widened pulse pressure and murmur suggestive of aortic insufficiency can lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae and bruising.
6. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy can lead to further neurological complications, such as seizures and coma.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure, which can require mechanical ventilation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis.
2. Vasopressors to manage hypotension.
3. Diuretics to manage volume overload.
4. Cardiac medications, such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, to manage cardiac complications.
5. Blood transfusions to manage thrombocytopenia.
6. Sedation and analgesia to manage encephalopathy.
7. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to detect any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of MSSA bacteremia
   and acute on chronic systolic CHF c/b hypotension
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus at OSH. Concern for endovascular source
   of infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as
   the patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms.
   Given his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms
   of [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve as witness on
   TEE.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no
   new murmur, pulse pressure widening, EKG QRS prolongation)
   - appreciate CSurg recs
   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   - TTE
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine lytes
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above. Required lasix last night for likely pulmonary
   edema.
   - consider PA catheter
   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and thrombocytopenia who was transferred to the ICU for management of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He has a mixed picture of hypotension, with components of distributive and cardiac shock. He also has acute kidney injury, which is likely due to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN) and/or immune-mediated complexes. The patient has a history of easy bleeding and bruising, and his thrombocytopenia is of unclear etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia and a vegetation on his bioprosthetic aortic valve, which increases the risk of endocarditis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his current ECG shows atrial flutter, which may increase his risk of stroke and arrhythmia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's AKI is likely due to AIN and/or immune-mediated complexes, and he may require further hemodynamic monitoring and treatment.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is of unclear etiology, and he may require further evaluation and treatment to determine the underlying cause.
5. Rash: The patient has a petechial rash on his back, which may be due to vasculitis, chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), or heat rash.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has increased direct bilirubin, which may indicate liver dysfunction or sepsis.
7. Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of encephalopathy, which may be due to infection, metabolic disorders, or toxic reactions.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to distributive, cardiac, or vasodilatory shock, and he may require further evaluation and treatment to determine the underlying cause.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to treat the patient's MSSA bacteremia with nafcillin and consider switching to vancomycin if there is no response.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and consider placing a pulmonary artery catheter to further evaluate his cardiac function.
3. Treat the patient's AKI with aggressive fluid management and consider using diuretics to reduce fluid overload.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and consider further evaluation and treatment to determine the underlying cause.
5. Monitor the patient's rash and consider further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperbilirubinemia and consider further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's encephalopathy and consider further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
8. Monitor the patient's hypotension closely and consider further evaluation and treatment to determine the underlying cause."

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of MSSA bacteremia
   and acute on chronic systolic CHF c/b hypotension
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus at OSH. Concern for endovascular source
   of infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as
   the patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms.
   Given his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms
   of [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve as witness on
   TEE.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no
   new murmur, pulse pressure widening, EKG QRS prolongation)
   - appreciate CSurg recs
   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   - TTE
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine lytes
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above. Required lasix last night for likely pulmonary
   edema.
   - consider PA catheter
   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # other
   - ionized calcium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and thrombocytopenia who was transferred to the hospital for management of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a mixed picture of hypotension, which appears to be a combination of distributive and cardiac shock.

The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, and there is concern for endocarditis given the presence of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. The patient's presentation with community-acquired bacteremia with symptoms of 12-23 days' duration prior to presentation puts him at high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis.

The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, and the differential diagnosis includes immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), myelodysplastic syndrome, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), nutritional deficiency (B12/Folate), and ethanol toxicity. The patient has a history of easy bleeding and bruising.

The patient has a wide pulse pressure, which is concerning for aortic insufficiency (AI). The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response, which is being rate-controlled.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely caused by aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN) and immune-mediated complexes. The patient has acute on chronic systolic CHF and is volume overloaded.

The patient has a rash, which appears to be petechiae, and the etiology is unknown. The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, which is likely due to sepsis-induced cholestasis.

The patient has encephalopathy, which is likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of infection. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but no documented history of this, and is not on anticoagulation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 7.7-10.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.3-12.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 29-43 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.0-3.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.20-0.47 ng/mL
* C-reactive protein (CRP): 59-127 mg/L
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 3.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): bilateral pulmonary edema
* Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE): vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve
* RUQ ultrasound: no evidence of septic emboli

The patient's medications include:

* Nafcillin
* Phenylephrine
* Morphine sulfate
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Olanzapine

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue treatment for MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis
* Monitor for signs of aortic insufficiency (AI)
* Consider further imaging to evaluate for AI
* Wean pressor as tolerated
* TEE
* Monitor for signs of acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
* Continue to treat infection
* Monitor for signs of encephalopathy
* Consider MRI in the future to evaluate for septic emboli
* Continue to monitor for signs of hyperbilirubinemia
* Continue to monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia
* Consider further evaluation for the etiology of thrombocytopenia
* Consider further evaluation for the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of MSSA bacteremia
   and acute on chronic systolic CHF c/b hypotension
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus at OSH. Concern for endovascular source
   of infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as
   the patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms.
   Given his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms
   of [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve as witness on
   TEE.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no
   new murmur, pulse pressure widening, EKG QRS prolongation)
   - appreciate CSurg recs
   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine lytes
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above. Required lasix last night for likely pulmonary
   edema.
   - consider PA catheter
   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and thrombocytopenia, admitted to the ICU for management of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 91/53 mmHg. He is receiving phenylephrine for hypotension and has a wide pulse pressure. His respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on a medium concentration mask.

The patient has a mixed picture of hypotension, with a component of distributive and cardiac shock. He has been treated with phenylephrine, which was weaned off after a successful fluid challenge, but overnight became hypotensive again.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and troponin-T, indicating an active infection. His creatinine level is elevated, consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI). His liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are also elevated.

The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology and is currently experiencing easy bleeding and bruising. His peripheral smear shows no schistocytes, making disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) less likely.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently experiencing AF with a rapid ventricular response. He is not on anticoagulation, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.7.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and a vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve increases his risk of endocarditis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated inflammatory markers increase his risk of sepsis.
3. AKI: The patient's elevated creatinine level and LFTs indicate AKI, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia and current bleeding and bruising increase his risk of bleeding complications.
5. Cardiac failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic CHF increases his risk of cardiac failure.
6. Encephalopathy: The patient's toxic/metabolic encephalopathy increases his risk of further neurologic decline.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and central venous catheters increase his risk of DVT.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should receive:

1. Antimicrobial therapy for endocarditis and bacteremia.
2. Close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.
3. Aggressive management of AKI, including fluid management and dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitoring of his bleeding and bruising, with consideration of platelet transfusions if necessary.
5. Cardiac monitoring and management of his CHF, including diuretics and vasopressors as necessary.
6. Close monitoring of his neurologic status, with consideration of further imaging studies if necessary.
7. Prophylaxis for DVT, including compression stockings and anticoagulation if necessary."
