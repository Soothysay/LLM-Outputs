Summary:

The patient, an 81-year-old woman, was admitted to the ICU after undergoing rigid bronchoscopy for biopsy of a right lower lobe mass and left atrial disease. She developed hypoxemia post-procedure, requiring non-rebreather oxygen therapy in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to her oxygen needs. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and emphysema.

The patient's current condition is characterized by mild respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/39 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on a venti mask with 80% oxygen.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild respiratory distress, coughing, and bronchial breath sounds on the right base. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her neck is supple with no signs of edema.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening opacification of the right lower lobe on a chest X-ray, and she is receiving empiric antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and oxygen therapy may indicate respiratory failure, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening opacification on chest X-ray and her history of COPD and emphysema make pneumonia a possible complication.
3. Lung cancer progression: The patient's widespread lung cancer and potential metastases may lead to further respiratory compromise and decreased quality of life.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD, CHF, and HTN increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory therapy may increase her risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged ICU stay may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function.
7. Psychosocial complications: The patient's critical illness and potential for prolonged ICU stay may lead to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue supportive care and wean oxygen therapy as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation if necessary.
3. Consider palliative treatments for lung cancer once biopsy results are available.
4. Address the patient's goals of care and involve her in the decision-making process.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and consider cardiology consultation if necessary.
6. Implement infection prevention measures, including proper hand hygiene, gloves, and masks.
7. Consider enteral nutrition support to prevent malnutrition."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman who underwent rigid bronchoscopy for biopsy and developed hypoxemia post-procedure, requiring NRB in the PACU. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to her oxygen needs. The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, emphysema, and lung mass, and is currently on empiric antibiotics and morphine sulfate.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 37.8Â°C (100Â°F)
* Heart rate: 90 bpm (90-96 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 93/39 mmHg (53-70 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (19-28 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild respiratory distress, coughing, and bronchial breath sounds at the right base. The patient is awake, alert, and somewhat unintelligible.

The patient's lab results and radiology images show worsening opacification of the right lower lobe on chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxemia post-bronchoscopy, which may be due to volume loss, aspiration, or hemorrhage
* Empiric antibiotics and supportive care
* Weaning of oxygen as tolerated
* Await biopsy results to determine the extent of lung cancer
* Consideration of palliative treatments once outpatient
* Addressing goals of care

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia or aspiration
* Respiratory failure
* Hemorrhage or bleeding
* Lung cancer progression or metastasis
* Infection or sepsis
* Cardiovascular complications due to underlying CAD and CHF
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to NPO status

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address her critical illness and underlying conditions."

Summary:

The patient, an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, emphysema, and lung mass, underwent rigid bronchoscopy and biopsy today. The procedure was complicated by hypoxemia, which required the patient to be transferred to the ICU for oxygen support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/39 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via a venti mask and has a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessable, and his skin, neurologic, and respiratory exams are not documented.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is hypoxemic post-bronchoscopy and has emphysema and a lung mass. Possible explanations for the hypoxemia include volume loss, aspiration, or hemorrhage. The patient will continue to receive supportive care and oxygen therapy as tolerated. The patient is likely to have widespread lung cancer, and biopsy results are pending. Palliative treatments may be considered once the patient is discharged from the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and emphysema increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration risk is increased due to his emphysema, which may lead to pneumonia.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's lung mass and biopsy procedure increase the risk of hemorrhage.
4. Sepsis: The patient's hypoxemia and lung mass increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, CHF, and HTN increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and limited oral intake may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of DVT.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and supportive care as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
3. Consider palliative treatments for the patient's lung cancer once biopsy results are available.
4. Provide nutritional support to prevent deficiencies.
5. Implement measures to prevent pressure ulcers, such as frequent turning and repositioning.
6. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of DVT."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Had four episodes of sustained VT that resolved with amiodarone. Was
   loaded with 150mg x 2 and then started on amiodarone drip.  Had
   respiratory distress at this time that required intubation by
   Anesthesia.  Antibiotics broadened to Vancomycin/cefepime. A-line
   placed after intubation, CVL placed as well. Patient was started on
   Phenylephrine for hypotension into the 80s systolic.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of CAD, MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and a necrotizing lung mass with pathology consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. She was admitted with respiratory distress and had four episodes of sustained VT, which resolved with amiodarone. She was intubated and required antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, as well as heparin and statin therapy. Her troponin levels were elevated, but her CK and CK-MB levels remained low. She was also found to have hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to her underlying lung cancer and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's VT episodes may recur, especially if her hypoxia and respiratory distress are not adequately managed.
3. Troponin Leak: The patient's troponin leak may indicate demand ischemia, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may worsen her respiratory distress and cardiac function.
5. Infection: The patient's broad-spectrum antibiotics may not fully cover her underlying infection, leading to antibiotic resistance and worsening of her condition.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and hypercalcemia may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's underlying CAD and MI may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia and respiratory distress may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, altered mental status, and decreased level of consciousness.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics for 14 days.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider extubation if her RSBI is <100.
3. Continue amiodarone therapy for 18 hours, then monitor off amiodarone and hold oral amiodarone therapy.
4. Trend the patient's EKG and monitor her cardiac function closely.
5. Perform a hypercalcemia work-up to determine the cause of her hypercalcemia.
6. Continue aspirin and statin therapy for her CAD.
7. Diurese the patient as necessary to manage her chronic kidney disease.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and replete as necessary.
9. Consider codeine for her cough and low-dose morphine for pain control.
10. Hold benzodiazepines at this time and restart as needed.
11. Continue protonix daily for her GERD.
12. Monitor the patient's anxiety and consider restarting benzodiazepines if necessary.
13. Continue prophylactic measures, including pneumoboots and DVT prophylaxis.
14. Monitor the patient's access lines and replace as necessary.
15. Consider a multidisciplinary approach to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, chronic pain, chronic kidney disease, and GERD. He presented with respiratory distress, VT, and troponin leak. The patient was intubated and received amiodarone for VT, broad-spectrum antibiotics for PNA, and heparin for anticoagulation. He was also started on phenylephrine for hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is on a spontaneous breathing trial with a RSBI of 65.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, but no significant increase in CK or CK-MB. His WBC count is elevated, and his platelet count is normal. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level.

The patient's plan includes continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation with heparin, and close monitoring of his respiratory status. He is also being considered for extubation today or tomorrow, pending a spontaneous breathing trial."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Had four episodes of sustained VT that resolved with amiodarone. Was
   loaded with 150mg x 2 and then started on amiodarone drip.  Had
   respiratory distress at this time that required intubation by
   Anesthesia.  Antibiotics broadened to Vancomycin/cefepime. A-line
   placed after intubation, CVL placed as well. Patient was started on
   Phenylephrine for hypotension into the 80s systolic.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that resolved with amiodarone. The patient has a history of respiratory distress, which required intubation, and has been placed on a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen consisting of vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak value of 0.25 ng/mL, and a low creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 19.8 K/uL, with a differential of 91.2% neutrophils, 6.0% lymphocytes, and 2.2% monocytes.

The patient has been started on heparin and statin therapy, and has been loaded with 150mg of amiodarone. The patient's amiodarone drip has been titrated to 1mg/min, and the patient's phenylephrine infusion has been adjusted to 0.9 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of sustained VT and the presence of amiodarone in their regimen increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and the presence of a prolonged partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) suggest that the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen and the presence of elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest that the patient may be at risk for sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated troponin levels and low creatinine level suggest that the patient may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
5. Bleeding: The patient's requirement for heparin and statin therapy increases the risk of bleeding.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of sustained VT and the presence of amiodarone in their regimen increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and the presence of a prolonged partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) suggest that the patient may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or brain injury.
8. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen and the presence of elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest that the patient may be at risk for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old woman with hx of CAD, MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia and a
   necrotizing lung mass with path consistent with non-small cell
   carcinoma with hospital course complicated by sustained VT with
   respiratory decompensation requiring intubation
   # Respiratory Failure. Volume overload vs. post-obstructive PNA.
   Increased work of breathing yesterday associated with VT. Patient was
   intubated by anaesthesia and did well on ventilator overnight. ABx were
   broadened (from levo), A-line and CVL were placed. Bedside bronch done,
   BAL negative for PMNs or organisms.  Patient extubated [**2151-3-25**] but with
   respiratory decompensation requiring re-intubation
   - Continue vanco/cefepime (day 1 = [**3-23**]) for duration of 14 days
   - Monitor on spontaneous breathing trial (RSBI < 100 this morning) and
   move towards extubation today
   #Hypercalcemia:
   - check parathyroid hormone related protein (cannot add on)
   # VT. Possibly triggered by hypoxia/respiratory distress. 4 episodes
   over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone (150 x 2 and then 0.5
   mg/min drip) and respiratory support.  Was intubated and started on
   amiodarone drip with no more episodes. Completed amiodarone drip,
   monitored off PO with no more episodes.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Troponin leak. Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachyarrhythmia,
   hypoxia. No significant increase in CK, CK-MB. Troponins now
   down-trending.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of CAD, MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and a necrotizing lung mass with a path consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. She was intubated due to respiratory decompensation and sustained VT. She was extubated briefly but required re-intubation due to increased work of breathing and diaphoresis. The patient has a positive bronchial brushing for malignant cells, and hypercalcemia work-up has been initiated. She has a history of chronic pain, chronic kidney disease, and GERD, and is taking various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains compromised, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory and cardiac complications.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent episodes of VT increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which could worsen her respiratory status.
4. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory decompensation and positive bronchial brushing for malignant cells increase her risk of developing sepsis.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory decompensation and recent intubation increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances and further complications.
7. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's GERD may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory status.
2. Initiate hypercalcemia work-up and management to prevent further complications.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Implement sepsis protocols if the patient develops sepsis.
5. Consider antibiotics if the patient develops pneumonia.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely to prevent further complications.
7. Manage the patient's GERD symptoms to prevent respiratory complications.
8. Consider discontinuing benzo and restarting as needed to manage anxiety.
9. Monitor the patient's pain levels and manage as needed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and was initially intubated. The patient was extubated for a brief period, but due to difficulty tolerating oxygen and increased work of breathing, was re-intubated. The patient has a history of non-small cell carcinoma and is being treated for hypercalcemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2Â°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to his underlying condition and the need for invasive ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's bronchial brushings returned positive for malignant cells, which increases the risk of pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's increased white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels suggest a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypercalcemia could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying condition and the use of anticoagulant medications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and his need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) increases his risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Wound complications: The patient's need for invasive lines and tubes increases his risk of wound complications such as infection or bleeding.
8. Psychological complications: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and his need for invasive ventilation could lead to psychological complications such as anxiety, depression, or delirium."

   - ONC: start zometa (gave pamidronate, which is formulary equivalent;
   per pharmacy this can be given qweek max)
   - CT/CTA chest: no PE, large asymmetric R sided effusion suspicious for
   malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis and masses in R lung
   - Rad Onc: No emergent XRT unless there is proximal airway compression.
   Will need repeat Chest CT (completed).  Could consider thoracentesis to
   help with extubation.
   - Echo: EF 34%, worrisome for new LAD infarct.  Cards c/s called,
   thinking about cath maybe Monday.  Recommended transfuse to Hct > 30%.
   No BB if we think she has acute heart failure right now.  Consider amio
   gtt if she goes back into VT.
   - transfused 2u pRBC
   - tried to gently diurese this PM with IV lasix 20 mg IV x 2 but
   patient became hypotensive with SBP dropping to high 70s and 80s.  Gave
   500 cc NS bolus and pressures improved.  Patient also appears to be
   having runs of Afib and NSVT on telemetry.
   - EKG obtained this AM, shows Q waves inferiorly and poor R wave
   progression consistent with new anterior infarct

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D4/8
   - pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart failure; less likely to be
   malignant or parapneumonic in nature
   - diuresis as tolerated; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L; use lasix drip to
   avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix
   - restart amio
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt with no further dosing.
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   - pull [**Month/Day (2) 864**] back to reduce ectopy
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate yesterday.
   - Follow up parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC yesterday.
   - continue to trend Hct
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - family might not know; attempt to wean sedation to have goals of
   care, clear up who should know about prognosis/make decisions on her
   behalf
   - Follow up Rad Onc, Heme Onc recs
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC, who presented with respiratory failure and was found to have a large asymmetric right-sided pleural effusion suspicious for malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis, and masses in the right lung. The patient's condition has worsened, and she is now experiencing cardiac complications, including a new anterior wall motion abnormality consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD, and has developed runs of atrial fibrillation and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to the large pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, which may lead to hypoxia and respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormality and runs of atrial fibrillation and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure.
3. Malignancy-related hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely related to the malignancy, and may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged stay on the ventilator increases the risk of developing VAP.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and prolonged stay in the ICU increase the risk of developing DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of corticosteroids increase the risk of developing stress ulcer.

The patient's treatment plan includes diuresis as tolerated, goal diuresis of -500 cc, and the use of lasix drip to avoid venodilatory effect of boluses. The patient will also receive empiric treatment with antibiotics, and will be followed up with Rad Onc and Heme Onc recommendations. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ONC: start zometa (gave pamidronate, which is formulary equivalent;
   per pharmacy this can be given qweek max)
   - CT/CTA chest: no PE, large asymmetric R sided effusion suspicious for
   malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis and masses in R lung
   - Rad Onc: No emergent XRT unless there is proximal airway compression.
   Will need repeat Chest CT (completed).  Could consider thoracentesis to
   help with extubation.
   - Echo: EF 34%, worrisome for new LAD infarct.  Cards c/s called,
   thinking about cath maybe Monday.  Recommended transfuse to Hct > 30%.
   No BB if we think she has acute heart failure right now.  Consider amio
   gtt if she goes back into VT.
   - transfused 2u pRBC
   - tried to gently diurese this PM with IV lasix 20 mg IV x 2 but
   patient became hypotensive with SBP dropping to high 70s and 80s.  Gave
   500 cc NS bolus and pressures improved.  Patient also appears to be
   having runs of Afib and NSVT on telemetry.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D4/8
   - pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart failure; less likely to be
   malignant or parapneumonic in nature
   - diuresis as tolerated; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L; use lasix drip to
   avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix
   - restart amio
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt with no further dosing.
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   - pull [**Month/Day (2) 864**] back to reduce ectopy
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate yesterday.
   - Follow up parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC yesterday.
   - continue to trend Hct
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - family might not know; attempt to wean sedation to have goals of
   care, clear up who should know about prognosis/make decisions on her
   behalf
   - Follow up Rad Onc, Heme Onc recs
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and a large asymmetric right-sided effusion suspicious for malignant effusion.

The patient has been receiving treatment for her conditions, including empiric antibiotics, diuresis as tolerated, and aspirin to reduce venodilation. She has also been restarted on amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 19.3
* Hct: 28.0
* Plt: 502
* Cr: 1.0
* TropT: 0.19
* TCO2: 31
* Glucose: 110
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/27.1/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 12/3/0.15, ALT/AST: 4-6, Alk Phos/T Bili: 72/0.2, Differential-Neuts: 91.2%, Lymph: 6.0%, Mono: 2.2%, Eos: 0.5%, Fibrinogen: 719 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.2 g/dL, LDH: 189 IU/L, Ca++: 10.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* GEN: intubated, sedated
* CV: RRR
* RESP: rhonchorous
* ABD: S, discomfort to palp, ND

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Acute heart failure
* Ventricular tachycardia
* Hypercalcemia
* Anemia
* Non-small cell lung cancer
* Hyperlipidemia

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued empiric treatment with antibiotics
* Diuresis as tolerated
* Aspirin to reduce venodilation
* Restarted amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia
* Follow-up with Rad Onc and Heme Onc
* Consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be difficult to wean off vent
* Monitor for hypercalcemia and anemia
* Continue to trend Hct
* Follow-up with family to discuss goals of care and prognosis
* Consider tube feeds after Rad Onc recs"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ONC: start zometa (gave pamidronate, which is formulary equivalent;
   per pharmacy this can be given qweek max)
   - CT/CTA chest: no PE, large asymmetric R sided effusion suspicious for
   malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis and masses in R lung
   - Rad Onc: No emergent XRT unless there is proximal airway compression.
   Will need repeat Chest CT (completed).  Could consider thoracentesis to
   help with extubation.
   - Echo: EF 34%, worrisome for new LAD infarct.  Cards c/s called,
   thinking about cath maybe Monday.  Recommended transfuse to Hct > 30%.
   No BB if we think she has acute heart failure right now.  Consider amio
   gtt if she goes back into VT.
   - transfused 2u pRBC
   - tried to gently diurese this PM with IV lasix 20 mg IV x 2 but
   patient became hypotensive with SBP dropping to high 70s and 80s.  Gave
   500 cc NS bolus and pressures improved.  Patient also appears to be
   having runs of Afib and NSVT on telemetry.
   - EKG obtained this AM, shows Q waves inferiorly and poor R wave
   progression consistent with new anterior infarct

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation
   - pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart failure; less likely to be
   malignant or parapneumonic in nature
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D4/8
   - diuresis as tolerated; goal diuresis -500 cc
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt with no further dosing.
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate yesterday.
   - Follow up parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC yesterday.
   - continue to trend Hct
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ONC: start zometa (gave pamidronate, which is formulary equivalent;
   per pharmacy this can be given qweek max)
   - CT/CTA chest: no PE, large asymmetric R sided effusion suspicious for
   malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis and masses in R lung
   - Rad Onc: No emergent XRT unless there is proximal airway compression.
   Will need repeat Chest CT (completed).  Could consider thoracentesis to
   help with extubation.
   - Echo: EF 34%, worrisome for new LAD infarct.  Cards c/s called,
   thinking about cath maybe Monday.  Recommended transfuse to Hct > 30%.
   No BB if we think she has acute heart failure right now.  Consider amio
   gtt if she goes back into VT.
   - transfused 2u pRBC
   - tried to gently diurese this PM with IV lasix 20 mg IV x 2 but
   patient became hypotensive with SBP dropping to high 70s and 80s.  Gave
   500 cc NS bolus and pressures improved.  Patient also appears to be
   having runs of Afib and NSVT on telemetry.
   - EKG obtained this AM, shows Q waves inferiorly and poor R wave
   progression consistent with new anterior infarct

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU for elective bronchoscopy and developed respiratory failure, likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by a large pleural effusion. The patient also has new systolic heart dysfunction, worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuresis, and furosemide, and has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC). She has been experiencing runs of atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on telemetry.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 96%, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicative of myocardial infarction, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, which may be related to the patient's malignancy. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion, with empiric treatment with antibiotics and diuresis as tolerated.
* Acute heart failure: likely due to new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD, with cardiac enzymes showing flat CKs and downtrending troponins.
* Ventricular tachycardia: likely triggered by recent ischemic event, with continued monitoring and potential treatment with amiodarone.
* Hypercalcemia: likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors, with dosing with pamidronate and follow-up parathyroid-related peptide levels.
* Anemia: s/p transfusion of 2 units of pRBC, with continued trending of hemoglobin levels.
* Non-small cell lung cancer: biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis, with follow-up recommendations from Rad Onc and Heme Onc.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of lung function, development of respiratory acidosis, or need for mechanical ventilation.
* Acute heart failure: worsening of cardiac function, development of cardiogenic shock, or need for inotropes.
* Ventricular tachycardia: development of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which may require cardioversion or defibrillation.
* Hypercalcemia: worsening of hypercalcemia, development of cardiac arrhythmias or conduction disturbances, or need for further treatment with bisphosphonates.
* Anemia: worsening of anemia, development of fatigue or shortness of breath, or need for further transfusions.
* Non-small cell lung cancer: progression of disease, development of metastases, or need for further treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy."

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation. Patient made DNR/DNI
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D5/8
   - pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart failure; less likely to be
   malignant or parapneumonic in nature
   - diuresis as tolerated, limited by low BP; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L;
   use lasix drip to avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - consider milrinone drip
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix
   - continue amio
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent and in line with goals
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding bb
   - on lasix gtt, consider milrinone
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back [**Month/Day (2) 864**] and vtach has ceased
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   .
   Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI, poor
   forward flow and several new medications.
   - trend
   .
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate yesterday.
   - Follow up parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - patient DNR/DNI, continue to dynamically assess goals of care
   - Follow up Rad Onc, Heme Onc recs
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Onc recs - none
   - cards recs - not going to cath.  probably.
   - rad onc recs - none
   - pull back line, appropriate location.
   - PM lytes were normal.  lasix gtt were maintained but still 400cc
   positive at 1830.  ACEI is deferred due to hypotension.
   - started amio PO 200mg [**Hospital1 **] for ventricular ectopy
   - decreased sedation - need to address goals of care.
   - vent - currently on pressure support, now tachypnea, continue
   suctioning - no change for now, SBT in a day or two.  We increased
   PEEP.
   - transaminitis mild.  Lipase negative.
   - Family meeting noted pt to be DNR.
   - UA/UCx, BCx were done due to temp of 101.4 overnight.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and worsening oxygenation. The patient has undergone bronchoscopy, and her condition has deteriorated, with a recent ischemic event likely caused by a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and her oxygenation is being maintained with 40% FiO2.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which have been controlled with amiodarone bolus and gtt.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has mild transaminitis, likely due to the recent ischemic event and the introduction of new medications.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia likely caused by malignancy-related tumor factors, which has been treated with pamidronate.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which has been stabilized with transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which has been treated with atorvastatin 80 mg/day.
8. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, with a total fluid input of 2852 mL and output of 2837 mL over 24 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration of her condition.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient may experience further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infections: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can worsen her condition.
4. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to her anemia and the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient may experience further complications from her hypercalcemia, such as cardiac arrhythmias or renal failure.
6. Fluid overload: The patient may experience further fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac failure or respiratory distress.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac dysfunction with medications and consider further interventions if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's ventricular tachycardia and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's transaminitis and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hypercalcemia and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her transfusion regimen as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperlipidemia and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's fluid overload and adjust her fluid management plan as needed.
9. Consider further interventions, such as therapeutic thoracentesis or cardiac catheterization, if necessary.
10. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and healthcare team regarding her condition and plan of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC. She was admitted with respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and worrisome for LAD infarct.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support with a pressure support mode, and her oxygenation is improving.
* Acute heart failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD.
* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had four episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which broke with amiodarone bolus and gtt, and is currently on PO amio.
* Transaminitis: The patient has mild transaminitis with AST and ALT levels around 100.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient has corrected calcium levels above 12, likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors.
* Anemia: The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of PRBC on 3/25 and is stable.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on atorvastatin 80 mg/day.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Acute heart failure: Cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac tamponade.
* Ventricular tachycardia: Sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest.
* Transaminitis: Hepatic failure, coagulopathy, and increased risk of bleeding.
* Hypercalcemia: Renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
* Anemia: Hypovolemic shock, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of infection.
* Hyperlipidemia: Atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Empiric treatment with antibiotics (vanc/cefepime), D5/8, and diuresis as tolerated.
* Weaning sedation to raise pressures and repeat SBT.
* Consideration of milrinone drip if low pressure.
* Continue aspirin and amio.
* Therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be difficult to wean off vent.
* Follow-up with Rad Onc and Heme Onc recs.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be

   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D6/8
   - diuresis as tolerated, limited by low BP; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L;
   use lasix drip to avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - wean sedation to raise pressures
   - repeat SBT
   - consider milrinone drip if low pressure, or levophe
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix
   - continue amio
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC, who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a DNR/DNI status and is being treated for several medical conditions, including acute heart failure, hypercalcemia, anemia, transaminitis, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/47 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 248, indicating adequate oxygenation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, including troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating a recent myocardial infarction. Her blood count shows a mild anemia, and her liver function tests are mildly elevated, indicating transaminitis.

The patient's radiology results show a large pleural effusion on the right side, which is likely due to her malignancy. She has also had a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Empiric treatment with antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for possible pneumonia.
2. Diuresis with lasix to manage fluid overload.
3. Weaning of sedation to raise blood pressure.
4. Repeat SBT to assess respiratory status.
5. Consideration of milrinone drip if blood pressure remains low.
6. Continued aspirin therapy to reduce venodilation of lasix.
7. Continued amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia.
8. Monitoring for hypercalcemia and anemia.
9. Treatment of transaminitis with trend of liver function tests.
10. Follow-up with radiation oncology to assess feasibility of radiation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pleural effusion or pneumonia.
2. Cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Hypotension due to vasodilation or cardiac failure.
4. Hypercalcemia due to malignancy-related tumor factors.
5. Anemia due to blood loss or bone marrow suppression.
6. Transaminitis due to liver damage or medication toxicity.
7. Infection due to pneumonia or sepsis.
8. Pulmonary embolism due to immobility or malignancy.
9. Heart failure due to cardiac dysfunction or coronary artery disease.
10. Malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition or gastrointestinal dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D6/8
 consider switching
   to zosyn if continues to have fevers
   - holding on diuresis, d/c lasix drip
   - attempt to control afterload
   - transduce CVP for targetted understanding of fluid status
   - wean sedation to raise pressures
   - can use low dose pressors as need
   - continue aspirin
   - continue amio
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding bb
   - on lasix gtt, consider milrinone prn
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back [**Month/Day (4) 864**] and vtach has ceased
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   .
   Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI, poor
   forward flow and several new medications.
   - trend
   .
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate 4.2, improving.
   - Follow up parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. She has been diagnosed with acute heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, transaminitis, hypercalcemia, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. She has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and medications for heart failure, and has undergone bronchoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scans.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying lung cancer and pleural effusion. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory status, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's new systolic heart dysfunction and ventricular tachycardia increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
3. Infections: The patient's antibiotics may not be effective against her underlying infection, and there is a risk of further infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy increase her risk of bleeding, which could be exacerbated by her medications.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's hyperlipidemia and anemia may indicate nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her overall health.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may be related to her lung cancer and could lead to further complications, such as kidney damage or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be related to her liver dysfunction and could worsen her overall health.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen her overall health and increase her risk of bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and cardiac function closely.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotics and diuretics as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any abnormalities.
4. Consider ordering further diagnostic tests, such as echocardiograms or cardiac catheterization, to assess the patient's cardiac function.
5. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist or pulmonologist for further management.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider ordering further diagnostic tests, such as liver function tests or blood counts, to assess the patient's overall health.
7. Consider ordering further diagnostic tests, such as a bone scan or parathyroid hormone levels, to assess the patient's hypercalcemia.
8. Consider ordering further diagnostic tests, such as liver function tests or blood counts, to assess the patient's transaminitis and anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and new NSCLC. He developed acute respiratory failure following bronchoscopy and was intubated. He remains ventilator-dependent and has a volume overload, which may be a barrier to extubation. The patient is also experiencing thick secretions, fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which may be indicative of VAP and/or sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension may indicate VAP, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and mortality.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension may also indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and low EF (30%) make him susceptible to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and mortality.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and mortality.
5. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload may lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and mortality.
6. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and mortality.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's critically ill status and prolonged stay in the ICU may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate his underlying condition and increase the risk of complications.
8. Medication-related complications: The patient's use of multiple medications, including sedatives, antibiotics, and cardiac medications, may increase the risk of medication-related complications such as medication interactions, adverse reactions, and overdose.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D7/8
 consider switching
   to zosyn if continues to have fevers
   - monitor CVP
   - wean sedation in AM
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - continue amiodarone
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding BB
   - on lasix gtt, consider milrinone prn
   - f/u Cards recs; ask them to provide further mgmt recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back [**Month/Day (4) 864**] and vtach has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - on PO amiodarone
   .
   Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI, poor
   forward flow and several new medications.
   - trend
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - RSBI of 175 in the morning, which improved to 70s with increased
   sedation
   - increase her PS on vent
   - Continues to have large secretions so will not attempt extubation
   - Family meeting:  patient remains DNR, but can re-intubated.
   - PM lytes: stable renal function
   - restarted diuresis with lasix 10 mg IV x 1 followed by 2 mg/hr gtt,
   later uptitrated to 4 mg/hr gtt, improved UOP but unable to catch up
   with ins
   - patient became slightly agitated at night, needed to have increased
   sedation + switched to AC; this caused her pressures to drop (MAP ~ 55)
   so started low dose norepinephrine with good effect

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's RSBI of 117 and continued need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities and downtrending troponins suggest a new infarct in the territory of the LAD, which may be contributing to acute heart failure.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recent episode of ventricular tachycardia, likely triggered by recent ischemic event and/or hypoxia/respiratory distress, requires close monitoring and continued treatment with amiodarone.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated AST and ALT levels, likely due to MI, poor forward flow, and new medications, require close monitoring and potential treatment.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels, likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors, require close monitoring and potential treatment with lasix and/or fluids.
6. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct levels, despite recent transfusion, require continued monitoring and potential treatment.
7. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The patient's biopsy results confirm the diagnosis, and the patient remains DNR.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's recent ischemic event and new statin therapy require close monitoring and potential adjustments to lipid levels.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal complications, including stress ulcers and constipation, requires prophylaxis with PPI and bowel regimen.
10. Pain Management: The patient's need for pain management requires ongoing assessment and treatment with fentanyl and midazolam.

The patient's overall condition is complex, with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and treatment. The patient's DNR status and ongoing respiratory failure suggest that further treatment may be limited, and the patient's goals of care should be reassessed regularly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and worsening lung parenchymal abnormalities. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. She has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and vasopressors, and is receiving IV fluids and nutrition.

The patient's recent events include an increase in respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) from 175 to 70s with increased sedation, and a family meeting was held to discuss her DNR status. She had a slight increase in agitation at night, which was managed with increased sedation and the addition of norepinephrine to her vasopressor regimen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 482 x 10^9/L. Her electrolyte levels are stable, with a potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L and a sodium level of 136 mmol/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL, and her creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include acute heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, transaminitis, hypercalcemia, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. She is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 92%. She may be at risk for further respiratory failure if her lung function deteriorates or if she develops pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, and her white blood cell count is elevated. She may be at risk for sepsis if her infection worsens or if she develops a new infection.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias if her heart function deteriorates or if she develops a new cardiac condition.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and her BUN level is 26 mg/dL. She may be at risk for further renal failure if her kidney function deteriorates or if she develops a new kidney condition.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding if her platelet count decreases or if she develops a new gastrointestinal condition.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is elevated, and she may be at risk for further hypercalcemia if her parathyroid hormone level increases or if she develops a new condition that affects her calcium levels.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.4 g/dL, and she may be at risk for further anemia if her blood loss increases or if she develops a new condition that affects her blood production.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and to improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D8, continue for 10 day
   course for treatment of post-obstructive pnemonia
   - monitor CVP
   - continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - continue amiodarone
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding BB
   - d/c free water flushes
   - on lasix gtt, on pressors --> consider milrinone prn
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management/adding milrinone
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - on PO amiodarone
   .
   Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI, poor
   forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted with respiratory failure and new systolic heart dysfunction, worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: She is mechanically ventilated and has a tracheostomy. Her respiratory status is stable, but she requires ongoing respiratory support.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Her cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had four episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which broke with amiodarone bolus and gtt. She is currently on PO amiodarone and has been pulled back from CVL.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST and ALT levels, which have resolved as of 3/29.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has improving hypercalcemia, likely related to malignancy-related tumor factors. She has been dosed with pamidronate and is being treated with lasix and fluids PRN.
6. Anemia: The patient has received a transfusion of 2u pRBC and is being monitored for ongoing anemia.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has been started on atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of her recent ischemic event.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and systolic heart dysfunction, which is worrisome for a LAD infarct. She has a DNR/DNI status. The patient's condition has been complicated by labile blood pressure, respiratory failure, and new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. She has also experienced ventricular tachycardia, which is likely triggered by recent ischemic events and hypoxia/respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to her underlying lung parenchymal abnormalities and pleural effusion.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a new infarct, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's recent episodes of ventricular tachycardia may indicate a high risk of recurrent arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels may worsen her cardiac function and increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen her cardiac function and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's empiric antibiotic treatment and the presence of a central line and arterial line increase her risk of infection.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate fluid overload and increase her risk of cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponins to assess the extent of cardiac damage.
2. Consider switching to zosyn if the patient continues to have fevers.
3. Monitor the patient's CVP and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
4. Wean the patient off pressors and consider milrinone prn.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider further cardiac imaging to assess the extent of cardiac damage and guide further management.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
8. Consider further management of the patient's hypercalcemia, including further dosing with pamidronate and monitoring of parathyroid-related peptide levels.
9. Continue to trend the patient's Hct and consider further transfusions as necessary.
10. Consider further management of the patient's anemia, including further transfusions and consideration of erythropoietin therapy."

   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D8, continue for 10 day
   course for treatment of post-obstructive pnemonia
   - monitor CVP
   - continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - continue amiodarone
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding BB
   - d/c free water flushes
   - on lasix gtt, on pressors --> consider milrinone prn
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management/adding milrinone
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - on PO amiodarone
   .
   Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI, poor
   forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted with respiratory failure and new systolic heart dysfunction, worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic, with multiple medical issues requiring attention. Notable findings include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and a PaO2 of 95%.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had several episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were likely triggered by recent ischemic events and hypoxia/respiratory distress. She was treated with amiodarone and has since been stable.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's corrected calcium level is still elevated, likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors. She was treated with pamidronate and is being monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**3-25**] and has been stable since then.
6. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated AST and ALT levels, which have since resolved.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient was started on atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of recent ischemic events.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to her respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and multiple medical issues make her susceptible to sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's respiratory failure and DVT risk make her susceptible to PE.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's recent ischemic event and ventricular tachycardia episodes increase her risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Malignancy progression: The patient's NSCLC may progress despite treatment, leading to further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued respiratory support with mechanical ventilation.
2. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and rhythm.
3. Treatment of hypercalcemia with pamidronate.
4. Continued weaning of sedation and pulmonary toilet.
5. Monitoring of blood pressure and fluid status.
6. Consideration of adding milrinone for cardiac support.
7. Follow-up with cardiology regarding management and adding milrinone.
8. Continued treatment with antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia.
9. Monitoring of liver function and transaminitis.
10. Follow-up with oncology regarding NSCLC treatment.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in
   nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D9, continue for 10 day
   course for treatment of post-obstructive pnemonia (likely will be
   longer)
   - f/u on repeat CT of chest to eval for interval changes

   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - added on BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - repeating echo, eval for EF, intracardiac shunt etc.
   - on lasix gtt, on pressors --> consider milrinone prn
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complex medical issues.

The patient's recent events include a thoracentesis procedure, which revealed a large pleural effusion on the right side. The effusion was drained, and a pigtail catheter was placed to monitor output. The patient also experienced an isolated episode of hypotension to 60 systolic, which prompted increased pressor support.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.5Â°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, as well as elevated troponin levels. Her cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, but her troponin levels are downtrending, indicating that the acute episode of heart failure has passed. Her liver enzymes are also elevated, but the transaminitis has resolved.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and lasix, as well as empiric antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia. She is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and aspirin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient has experienced an acute episode of heart failure, which may recur if not properly managed.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may recur or worsen if not properly managed.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and neutrophils suggest the possibility of infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and kidney damage.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent complications such as cardiovascular instability and fatigue.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's elevated cholesterol levels may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent complications such as cardiovascular disease.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D8, continue for 10 day
   course for treatment of post-obstructive pnemonia

   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and new systolic heart dysfunction. The patient has undergone several interventions, including thoracentesis, and is being treated for various medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pleural effusion, which could worsen if not managed properly. Pneumonia cannot be excluded, and the patient is at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities suggest a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. This may lead to further cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's recent episodes of ventricular tachycardia may be triggered by central venous catheter (CVC) placement in the right ventricle or recent ischemic event. This could lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors. If not managed properly, this could lead to further complications, including nephrocalcinosis and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications, including cardiac complications and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's recent ischemic event and diagnosis of NSCLC make them at risk for further cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's recent diagnosis of NSCLC and pleural effusion make them at risk for developing pneumonia, which could worsen their respiratory failure.
8. DVT: The patient's history of hypertension and recent CVC placement make them at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could lead to further complications, including pulmonary embolism.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications. The patient's treatment plan should be tailored to address their specific needs and comorbidities."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D10 of ABX, D2 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - on PO amiodarone
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted with respiratory failure and new systolic heart dysfunction, worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and has had a pigtail catheter inserted for pleural effusion drainage.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and her oxygenation is stable with a SpO2 of 100%. Her respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute, and her peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 23 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Her ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). She is receiving beta-blocker therapy and has been advised to continue aspirin.
* Hematology: The patient has a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 546 x 10^9/L. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and has been transfused with 2 units of platelets.
* Renal: The patient has a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 33 mg/dL. She is receiving furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management.
* Electrolytes: The patient has mild hypercalcemia, with a corrected calcium level of 9.9 mg/dL. Her phosphorus level is 5.5 mg/dL, and her magnesium level is 2.9 mg/dL.
* Liver: The patient has mild transaminitis, with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 100 IU/L.
* Endocrine: The patient has been treated with pamidronate for hypercalcemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate due to ongoing pleural effusion, pneumonia, or other respiratory complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function can worsen due to ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D10 of ABX, D2 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RISB
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.
   .
   #. FEN - No IVF, E- replete PRN, N- NPO ->will need to start tube feeds
   after rad-onc recs
   #. Access - CVL, A-line
   #. pPx -
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -stress ulcer ppx with PPI
   -Bowel regimen colace/senna
   -Pain management with fent/midaz

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's condition has been complicated by the following:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion, which is likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature. The effusion has been partially resolved with pigtail catheter placement and drainage.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient has developed new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient experienced four episodes of ventricular tachycardia over a 30-minute period, which broke with amiodarone bolus and gtt. The CVL was pulled back, and the VT has ceased.
4. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated AST and ALT levels, which resolved by [**3-29**].
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has improving hypercalcemia, which is likely related to malignancy-related tumor factors.
6. Anemia: The patient has been transfused with 2u pRBC and has a stable Hct.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's statin was changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of recent ischemic event.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the pleural effusion and underlying lung disease.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute heart failure and ventricular tachycardia may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion and recent use of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent transfusion may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and recent use of antibiotics may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of pigtail output and CVP.
2. Weaning of sedation and pulmonary toilet.
3. Continue aspirin and statin.
4. Holding off digoxin and monitoring of Hct.
5. F/u with cardiology regarding management.
6. Monitoring of creatinine and adjusting lasix rate accordingly.
7. Consideration of SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
8. F/u with oncology regarding management of NSCLC.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D10 of ABX, D2 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RISB
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC, presenting with respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and possible LAD infarct. She has a DNR/DNI status and has undergone bronchoscopy and pigtail catheter placement. The patient's condition has improved slightly, with a reduced pleural effusion and improved EF on repeat TTE.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Acute heart failure due to new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD.
	* Ventricular tachycardia likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.
2. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Respiratory failure due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).
	* Post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to cause resp failure.
3. **Hematological Complications:**
	* Anemia due to recent transfusion and ongoing bleeding.
	* Transaminitis resolved as of [**3-29**].
4. **Endocrine Complications:**
	* Hypercalcemia likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors, improving with pamidronate treatment.
5. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Post-obstructive PNA (POPN) cannot be excluded, but is less likely to cause respiratory failure.
	* VAP prophylaxis with Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**].
6. **Nutritional Complications:**
	* Malnutrition due to inability to take oral nutrition, requiring IV nutrition support.
7. **Other Complications:**
	* DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin.
	* Stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI.
	* Bowel regimen colace/senna.

**Plan:**

1. Continue empiric treatment with abx (vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better coverage of post-obstructive PNA).
2. Monitor pigtail output and CVP.
3. Wean sedation and continue pulmonary toilet.
4. Check RISB and continue aspirin.
5. Continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
6. Hold off digoxin and goal Hct > 30.
7. F/u with cardiology regarding management.
8. Balance lasix rate with creatinine.
9. Check pm lytes and consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
10. Continue to monitor for ventricular tachycardia and adjust central line as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute heart failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She has undergone bronchoscopy and has a pleural effusion, which is likely malignant or parapneumonic in nature.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 115/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory status is being managed with mechanical ventilation, and her fluid status is being monitored closely due to AKI.

The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 60 mmHg, which is concerning. To manage this, the team is avoiding fluid boluses and increasing pressors.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is at risk of developing acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The team is monitoring her creatinine levels closely and adjusting her lasix rate accordingly.
3. Acute heart failure: The patient has developed new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Her ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
4. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced several episodes of VT, which have been managed with amiodarone bolus and infusion. The team is monitoring her closely for any further episodes.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are elevated, likely due to her recent myocardial infarction (MI).
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are elevated, likely due to her malignancy. She has been treated with pamidronate, and her calcium levels are improving.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) levels are low, and she has been transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The team is monitoring her Hb levels closely.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid levels are elevated, and she has been started on atorvastatin 80 mg/day.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Empiric treatment with antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA).
2. Agitation management with antipsychotics.
3. Monitoring of pigtail output and CVP.
4. Pulmonary toilet and respiratory therapy.
5. Continue aspirin therapy.
6. Cardiology follow-up for management of her cardiac condition.
7. Hematology follow-up for management of her anemia.
8. Oncology follow-up for management of her NSCLC.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D11 of ABX, D3 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RISB
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses
   - Avoid increasing pressors
   - avoid bolusing with sedation
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.
   .
   #. FEN - No IVF, E- replete PRN, N- NPO ->will need to start tube feeds
   after rad-onc recs
   #. Access - CVL, A-line
   #. pPx -
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -stress ulcer ppx with PPI
   -Bowel regimen colace/senna
   -Pain management with fent/midaz

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D12 of ABX, D4 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RSBI (102 today)
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine stable this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c
d amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right. CT chest
   shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows improving EF and MR,
   and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less consistent with a
   cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D12 of ABX, D4 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RSBI
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Avoid increasing pressors
   - avoid bolusing with sedation due to vasoactive effects, recommend
   haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine stable this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.

 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory failure, acute heart dysfunction, and suspected left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. 

The patient's current condition is critical, with a fever of 102.1Â°F, tachypnea, and tachycardia. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central venous line (CVL) in place. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, hypercalcemia, and transaminitis, which have been resolved or are improving.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying lung disease, pleural effusion, or post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities and suspected LAD infarct may lead to further cardiac dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's current acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Hypercalcemia: Although the patient's hypercalcemia has been resolved, it may recur due to her underlying malignancy.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may recur due to her ongoing treatment and underlying liver disease.
6. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia may recur due to her underlying cardiac disease or CVL.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate erythropoietin production.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen due to her ongoing treatment and underlying metabolic disorders.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for changes in her respiratory, cardiac, renal, and liver function. Her treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly, and her medications should be optimized to minimize side effects and prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D12 of ABX, D4 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine stable this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, and further evaluation revealed a new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD infarct.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.1Â°F (38.9Â°C)
* Heart rate: 110 bpm
* Blood pressure: 125/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and has been given fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 19.1 K/uL
* Hct: 30.1%
* Plt: 37 K/uL
* Cr: 1.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 37 mmHg
* Glucose: 124 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 194 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* CT chest: resolving pleural effusion
* Repeat TTE: improving EF and MR, mixed venous sat 78%

The patient's diagnosis and plan are:

* Respiratory failure: likely post-obstructive PNA, treated with antibiotics
* Hypotension: treated with pressors, goal is to wean
* Acute renal failure: unclear etiology, treated with fluids and pressors
* Acute heart failure: treated with BB, goal Hct > 30
* Ventricular tachycardia: treated with amiodarone, monitor
* Hypercalcemia: treated with pamidronate, improving
* Anemia: stable since transfusion, continue to trend Hct
* Non-small Cell CA: biopsy results confirmed, outpatient f/u with Onc
* Hyperlipidemia: treated with atorvastatin

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis from untreated infection
* Cardiac arrhythmias from continued ischemia
* Acute kidney injury from continued hypotension
* Respiratory failure from untreated pneumonia
* Bleeding from continued anticoagulation
* Hypercalcemia from untreated malignancy
* Anemia from continued bleeding

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology studies to ensure that the patient is responding to treatment and to identify any potential complications early."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia,atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D11 of ABX, D3 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RISB
   - continue aspirin
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Avoid increasing pressors
   - avoid bolusing with sedation due to vasoactive effects, recommend
   haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 contrast induced
   -maintain lasix
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia,atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D11 of ABX, D3 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RISB
   - continue aspirin
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Avoid increasing pressors
   - avoid bolusing with sedation due to vasoactive effects, recommend
   haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 contrast induced
   -maintain lasix
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed respiratory failure.
* She is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and is tolerating intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/46 mmHg.
* She has a right pleural effusion that was drained, and her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via endotracheal tube, ventilator mode, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

**Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent myocardial infarction and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.
* Hypotension, which has resolved.
* Acute renal failure, likely contrast-induced, with an estimated creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL.
* Acute heart failure, with new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
* Ventricular tachycardia, likely triggered by central venous line (CVL) in the right ventricle or recent ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.
* Transaminitis, with AST and ALT levels around 100, which has resolved.
* Hypercalcemia, likely related to malignancy, with a corrected calcium level of 2.2 mmol/L.
* Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, which has been stabilized with transfusion.

**Treatment Plan:**

* Empiric treatment with antibiotics (vancomycin/cefepime --> vancomycin/[**Last Name (un) **] for better coverage of post-obstructive pneumonia).
* Treatment of agitation with antipsychotics.
* Monitoring of pigtail output.
* Monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and weaning of sedation.
* Pulmonary toilet and checking of respiratory system resistance (RSB).
* Continuation of aspirin.
* Management of hypercalcemia with lasix and fluids PRN.
* Monitoring of anemia and continuation of transfusions as needed.
* Follow-up with oncology and cardiology regarding management.

**Lab Results:**

* Complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 19.1, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 37.
* Blood chemistry tests show a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and calcium level of 7.9 mg/dL.
* Troponin-T level is 0.15 ng/mL, and CK-MB level is 3 ng/mL.

**Imaging Studies:**

* Chest computed tomography (CT) shows resolving pleural effusion.
* Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows improving ejection fraction and mixed venous saturation of 78%.

**Medications:**

* Vancomycin
* Cefepime
* Lasix
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam
* Haldol
* Amiodarone
* Atorvastatin
* Pamidronate
* Colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities and complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia related to lung cancer, and empiric treatment with antibiotics is ongoing.
3. Agitation: The patient is agitated, and antipsychotics are being used to manage this condition.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but the plan is to monitor blood pressure and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is contrast-induced, and lasix drip is being maintained to monitor urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels.
6. CHF: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The plan is to continue beta-blocker therapy as per Cardiology recommendations.
7. Vent tachycardia: The patient had ventricular tachycardia, which is likely triggered by CVL in the RV or recent ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress. The condition has resolved, and PO amiodarone is being continued.
8. LFT abnormalities: The patient has LFT abnormalities, including AST and ALT levels around 100, with AST>ALT, which is likely due to MI, poor forward flow, and new medications. The condition has resolved as of [**3-29**].
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which was treated with transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**2151-3-25**]. The plan is to continue to trend Hct levels.
10. Lung cancer: The patient has lung cancer, and there are no plans for intervention while in the ICU. Outpatient follow-up with Oncology is planned.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour
* Glycemic control: Monitoring and management of blood glucose levels
* Lines: PICC line and prophylactic antibiotics
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with boots, systemic anticoagulation with none, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker, and VAP prophylaxis with HOB elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and RSBI
* Comments: The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU. The patient is critically ill."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D13 of ABX, D5 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine shows mild improvement this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and worsening lung parenchymal abnormalities.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has tachycardia with a heart rate of 109 beats per minute and blood pressure of 118/53 mmHg. Her cardiac enzymes are normal, and her ejection fraction has improved to 45% on repeat echocardiogram.
* Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure, which is unclear in etiology. Her creatinine has shown mild improvement this morning, and her goal is to keep her near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory failure.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypercalcemia, which has resolved after treatment with pamidronate. She also has anemia, which is stable since her recent transfusion.
* Other complications: The patient has been experiencing agitation, which has been treated with antipsychotics. She has also had episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which have ceased after adjusting her central line and continuing PO amiodarone.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and recent bronchoscopy, there is a risk of post-obstructive pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient's acute renal failure and unclear etiology make it possible that she may develop sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's new systolic heart dysfunction and recent infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery make her at risk for further cardiac complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and respiratory failure make her at risk for further deterioration.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and recent use of anticoagulation therapy make her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Empiric treatment with antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia
* Treatment of agitation with antipsychotics
* Repeat chest X-rays after pigtail removal
* Monitoring of central venous pressure and weaning of sedation
* Pulmonary toilet and pressure support ventilation as tolerated
* Continued aspirin therapy
* Cardiology follow-up for further recommendations

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D13 of ABX, D5 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine shows mild improvement this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Condition:**

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She has undergone bronchoscopy, and the diagnosis of NSCLC was confirmed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and sedation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** The patient's respiratory failure and worsening lung parenchymal abnormalities may lead to ARDS, which can be life-threatening.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
3. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's AKI may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
4. **Sepsis:** The patient's respiratory failure, AKI, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
5. **Hypercalcemia:** Although the patient's hypercalcemia has resolved, it may recur if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
6. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
7. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** The patient's VT may recur if not managed properly, leading to cardiac complications such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient's immobilization and respiratory failure may increase the risk of PE, which can be life-threatening.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation and sedation as needed.
2. Manage the patient's cardiac status by continuing beta blockers and aspirin, and monitoring for signs of cardiac complications.
3. Continue to manage the patient's AKI by adjusting fluid management and monitoring electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust vasopressors as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponins to rule out further cardiac complications.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist and pulmonologist to optimize the patient's care.
8. Continue to educate the patient and her family on her condition and treatment plan.

**Action Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.
2. Adjust the patient's treatment plan as needed based on changes in her condition.
3. Collaborate with other healthcare providers to optimize the patient's care.
4. Educate the patient and her family on her condition and treatment plan.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and potential left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 50 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 118 mmHg.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. The cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat echocardiogram.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 33 mL/min. The patient's urine output is good, and the goal is to keep the patient's fluid balance even to avoid causing pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory failure.
* Agitation: The patient is agitated and has been treated with antipsychotics. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/53 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has hypercalcemia, which has resolved after treatment with pamidronate. The patient also has anemia, which has been stabilized with transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen due to the presence of pleural effusion, pneumonia, or other underlying lung diseases.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac dysfunction can lead to cardiac arrest, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Agitation: The patient's agitation can lead to physical harm, injury, or self-injury.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if not adequately treated, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Wean the patient off pressors and adjust the dose of vasopressors based on the patient's blood pressure.
3. Continue to treat the patient's AKI with fluid management and medication as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's agitation and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hyperlipidemia with statins and other medications as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as needed to maintain a stable hemoglobin level."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Trials of IPS mode, hopefully work towards
   SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However, limited
   progress to date.  Monitor
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p IP tap and pigtail placement on the right
   --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENT TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent ischemic
   event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue PO amio.
   Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has developed respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors including RLL lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from a recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, agitation, acute renal failure, CHF, and LFT abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may worsen if not properly managed. The patient's lung cancer, pneumonia, and atelectasis may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances and further organ dysfunction.
4. CHF: The patient's CHF may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further cardiac compromise and organ dysfunction.
5. LFT Abnormalities: The patient's LFT abnormalities may indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further organ dysfunction and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Lung Cancer: The patient's lung cancer may progress if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory compromise and decreased quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and trial of IPS mode to work towards SBT and eventual extubation.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
3. Manage the patient's hypotension with vasopressors and fluids as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
5. Manage the patient's CHF with medications and close monitoring of cardiac function.
6. Monitor the patient's LFTs closely and adjust medications as needed.
7. Manage the patient's anemia with transfusions as needed.
8. Consider chemotherapy for the patient's lung cancer if they are able to tolerate extubation.

Additional Notes:

* The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all possible measures should be taken to save the patient's life.
* The patient's disposition is ICU, indicating that they will continue to receive critical care in the ICU.
* The patient's total time spent in the ICU is 45 minutes, indicating that they have been in the ICU for a significant amount of time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Trials of IPS mode, hopefully work towards
   SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However, limited
   progress to date.  Monitor
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

   MICU Attending:
   Family meeting today, including HCP.  Updated medical condition,
   answered all questions.  Discussed poor progress on mechanical
   ventilator over past 13 days.  Underlying RLL malignancy without
   treatment options at this time.  Considering possibility of trach/PEG
   if no further progress.  HCP and [**Name2 (NI) 11864**] members express unnanimous
   decision that patient would NOT want trach and chronic mechanical
   ventilation.  Desire to assess over next few days, optimize medical
   condition in preparation of extubation trial (with no plans for
   reintubation).  Also, all agree on DNR in the event that patient
   experiences cardiac or further respiratory arrest.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 23 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals a warm and well-nourished individual with no acute distress. His lungs are clear, and his heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. He has right lower extremity edema, but no cyanosis or clubbing.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL. His white blood cell count is 16.5 K/uL, and his platelet count is 78 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an AST level of 27 and an ALT level of 25. His creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen level is 18.9 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent myocardial infarction and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.

The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and trial intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode, with the goal of eventually extubating the patient. However, the patient's progress has been limited to date.

The patient has a right pleural effusion, which has been drained via thoracentesis and pigtail placement. He also has pneumonia related to his lung cancer, which is being treated with antibiotics. He is receiving antipsychotics for agitation and vasopressors for hypotension. He has acute renal failure, which is being managed with furosemide and close monitoring of his urine output and blood urea nitrogen levels.

The patient has a history of cardiac enzymes showing flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that his acute myocardial infarction has passed. His left ventricular ejection fraction has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram.

The patient's lung cancer is being managed with chemotherapy, but there are no plans for intervention while he is in the intensive care unit. He will be followed up with oncology once he is extubated.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, and he may continue to require mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia related to his lung cancer, which may worsen or spread to other areas of his lungs.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a right pleural effusion, which may re-accumulate and require further drainage.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac enzymes showing flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that his acute myocardial infarction has passed. However, he may still be at risk for cardiac complications, such as ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen or lead to chronic kidney disease.
6. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, which may worsen or lead to more severe anemia.
7. Liver enzyme elevations: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutritional support, but he may still be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-calorie malnutrition.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Trials of IPS mode, hopefully work towards
   SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However, limited
   progress to date.  Monitor
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7Â°C (99.9Â°F)
* Heart rate: 109 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* White blood cell count: 16.5 x 10^9/L

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

* Respiratory failure due to right lower lobe (RLL) lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
* Acute renal failure due to contrast-induced nephropathy.
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3.
* Hypertension.
* Hyperglycemia.
* Anemia.

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) for pneumonia.
* Sedatives (midazolam and fentanyl) for agitation.
* Vasopressors (norepinephrine) for hypotension.
* Antihypertensives (lasix and enalapril) for hypertension.
* Anticoagulants (heparin) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
* Anti-emetics (ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting.
* Pain medications (morphine and hydromorphone) for pain management.

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Complete blood count (CBC): WBC 16.5 x 10^9/L, Hct 28.6%.

* Liver function tests (LFTs): AST 27 U/L, ALT 25 U/L.
* Electrolytes: Na 133 mmol/L, K 4.4 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation.
* Trials of inverse ratio ventilation (IRV) mode, hopefully work towards spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and eventually extubation trial if possible.
* Monitor for re-accumulation of right pleural effusion.
* Continue empiric treatment with antibiotics for pneumonia.
* Manage agitation with antipsychotics.
* Monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
* Maintain lasix drip for acute renal failure.
* Continue b-blocker for cardiac arrhythmia.
* Monitor for signs of lung cancer progression.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening lung cancer or pneumonia.
* Acute kidney injury due to contrast-induced nephropathy or sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmia due to hypoxia or electrolyte imbalance.
* Sepsis due to pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility.
* Anemia due to bleeding or chronic kidney disease.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or promptly manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D14 of ABX, D6 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine shows mild improvement this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.

   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute heart failure, and possible sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 450 mL, and her oxygen saturation is 97%. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her peak inspiratory pressure is 23 cmH2O.
* Acute heart failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Her ejection fraction has improved to 45% on repeat echocardiogram.
* Sepsis: The patient has a temperature of 37.2Â°C (99Â°F), a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 89/42 mmHg. Her white blood cell count is 22.6 x 10^9/L, and her C-reactive protein is 78 mg/dL.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 21.4 mL/min. Her urine output is good, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.
* Anemia: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL and a hematocrit of 24.7%. She has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level has resolved, and she has been treated with pamidronate.
* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which have been treated with amiodarone. Her central line has been pulled back, and she is currently not experiencing any further episodes.

Potential medical complications that may arise in the patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease, pleural effusion, or other factors.
* Cardiac complications: The patient may experience further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction, due to her underlying cardiac disease or new infarct.
* Sepsis: The patient may experience further sepsis due to her underlying infections or other factors.
* Renal failure: The patient may experience further renal failure due to her underlying kidney disease, dehydration, or other factors.
* Anemia: The patient may experience further anemia due to her underlying blood loss, bone marrow suppression, or other factors.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient may experience further hypercalcemia due to her underlying malignancy or other factors.
* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient may experience further episodes of ventricular tachycardia due to her underlying cardiac disease or other factors.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function
* Cardiac medications to manage her heart failure and arrhythmias
* Antibiotics to treat her underlying infections
* Renal replacement therapy to manage her acute renal failure
* Blood transfusions to manage her anemia
* Pamidronate to treat her hypercalcemia
* Amiodarone to manage her ventricular tachycardia
* Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and other parameters to detect any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D14 of ABX, D6 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine shows mild improvement this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with elective bronchoscopy and subsequently developed respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. Her SpO2 is 97%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a tachycardic rhythm and new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL and is on hemodialysis.
* Neurological status: The patient is intubated and sedated, but responds appropriately to questions and moves all limbs purposefully.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may develop further respiratory failure or complications such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities and systolic heart dysfunction may lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremic syndrome.
* Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and intubation may lead to further neurological complications such as seizures, coma, or brain death.

The patient's medications include:

* Fentanyl for pain management
* Furosemide for fluid management
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
* Haloperidol for agitation management
* Aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis
* Statin for hyperlipidemia management
* Pamidronate for hypercalcemia management

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 22.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 789 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 154 mg/dL
* Glucose: 153 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support
* Monitor cardiac status and manage cardiac complications
* Continue renal replacement therapy and manage renal complications
* Monitor neurological status and manage neurological complications
* Continue pain management and sedation as needed
* Continue to monitor and manage electrolyte imbalances and acidosis
* Continue to monitor and manage hypercalcemia and hyperlipidemia"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient is tolerating IPS mode and is being monitored for potential extubation trial. The patient has several comorbidities, including right pleural effusion, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. He is also experiencing agitation, hypotension, and LFT abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is related to his lung cancer and may lead to further respiratory complications if not treated effectively.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is contrast-induced and may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is improving but may require further management, including vasopressor support.
5. LFT Abnormalities: The patient's LFT abnormalities may be related to his MI and may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Lung Cancer: The patient's lung cancer may progress and require further treatment, including chemotherapy.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are showing flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. However, the patient may still be at risk for further cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor for potential extubation trial.
2. Manage the patient's pneumonia with empiric treatment and monitor for signs of progression.
3. Monitor the patient's acute renal failure and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension and LFT abnormalities.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider chemotherapy for the patient's lung cancer if he is able to tolerate extubation.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to provide nutritional support and monitor the patient's nutritional status."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Tolerating IPS mode this AM, hopefully work
   towards SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However,
   limited progress to date.  Monitor.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Tolerating IPS mode this AM, hopefully work
   towards SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However,
   limited progress to date.  Monitor.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with respiratory failure due to a multifactorial etiology, including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, tolerating intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) mode. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, and the plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, with a goal of working towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and eventual extubation.
2. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient had a right pleural effusion, which was drained via thoracentesis and pigtail placement. The patient will be monitored for re-accumulation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia related to lung cancer, and empiric treatment with antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) is ongoing.
4. Agitation: The patient has agitation, which is being managed with antipsychotics.
5. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which is improving slowly. The plan is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60 mmHg, with vasopressor support as needed.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is attributed to contrast-induced nephropathy. The plan is to maintain lasix drips and monitor urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has improved to 45% on repeat transesophageal echocardiography (TTE). The plan is to continue beta-blocker therapy as per cardiology recommendations.
8. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had a episode of ventricular tachycardia, which is likely triggered by central venous line (CVL) in the right ventricle or recent ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress. The episode has resolved, and the CVL has been pulled back.
9. Liver Function Test (LFT) Abnormalities: The patient has LFT abnormalities, including elevated AST and ALT levels, which have resolved as of [**3-29**].
10. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is being managed with packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions.
11. Lung Cancer: The patient has lung cancer, and no plans for intervention are being considered while in the ICU. Chemotherapy will be considered if the patient is able to tolerate extubation, and outpatient follow-up with oncology is planned."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.
   - gentle hydration
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent elective bronchoscopy and developed respiratory failure, systolic heart dysfunction, and acute kidney injury. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 36 mmHg, and pO2 of 102 mmHg. The patient's RSBI is 133, and the patient's SpO2 is 100%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient's cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. The patient's urine output is good, and the patient is on gentle hydration.
* Neurological: The patient is on antipsychotics for agitation and is on gentle hydration.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient is on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and is NPO.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's lung parenchymal abnormalities and pleural effusion can lead to further respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormalities can lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's AKI can worsen, leading to further decline in kidney function.
* Sepsis: The patient's respiratory and cardiac instability can lead to sepsis, which can worsen the patient's condition.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia can recur, leading to further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Empiric treatment with antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia
* Treatment of agitation with antipsychotics
* Repeat chest X-rays after pigtail removal
* Monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and weaning of sedation
* Pulmonary toilet and pressure support ventilation as tolerated
* Continuing aspirin therapy
* Gentle hydration for AKI
* Weaning of pressors as able
* Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and EF
* Repeat TTE as needed
* Outpatient follow-up with oncology

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - pending family meeting for goals of care (preped for extubation)
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and new systolic heart dysfunction, which is worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a SpO2 of 100%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 36 mmHg, and pO2 of 102 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. The cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL and a urine output of 1,220 mL. The etiology is unclear, but it is thought to be contrast-induced or pre-renal.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia with a Hct of 23.3% and has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia has resolved with the administration of pamidronate.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's new infarct can lead to further cardiac damage, including cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
* Renal: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease, leading to electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased risk of infections.
* Hematological: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia can recur, leading to further complications such as nephrocalcinosis, pancreatitis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Empiric treatment with antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia
* Treatment of agitation with antipsychotics
* Repeat CXR after pigtail removal
* Monitoring of CVP and weaning of sedation
* Pulmonary toilet and PSV as tolerated
* Continuation of aspirin
* Pending family meeting for goals of care
* Weaning of pressors as able
* Gentle hydration for acute renal failure
* Free water administration
* Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and EF
* Treatment of hyperlipidemia with atorvastatin
* Outpatient follow-up with oncology
* Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including RLL lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction. The patient has also experienced agitation, hypotension, acute renal failure, CHF, ventricular tachycardia, and LFT abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is related to lung cancer and requires continued empiric treatment with antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem).
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation is being managed with antipsychotics, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further episodes.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is improving slowly, and vasopressors may be necessary to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is contrast-induced and requires continued lasix drip and close monitoring of UO, BUN, and Creatinine.
6. CHF: The patient's CHF is related to a new anterior wall motion abnormality consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD, and cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins.
7. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia was likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress and has resolved.
8. LFT abnormalities: The patient's LFT abnormalities (AST, ALT) have resolved as of [**3-29**].
9. Anemia: The patient has received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**] and is stable, with continued monitoring of Hct.
10. Lung cancer: The patient's lung cancer requires consideration for chemotherapy if the patient is able to tolerate extubation.

ICU Care:

The patient is receiving nutrition support with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has a PICC line and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR, and the disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.  Will discuss direction
   of care
 HCP states patient would not want trach.  [**Month (only) 11**] move to
   extubation attempt
 will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.  Will discuss direction
   of care
 HCP states patient would not want trach.  [**Month (only) 11**] move to
   extubation attempt
 will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - pending family meeting for goals of care (preped for extubation)
   .
   Anemia
 guiac positive stool, modest response to transfusion
   - trend
   - family meeting
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, likely caused by pleural effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been treated with antibiotics, bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy. Her condition has been complicated by several issues, including:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine and electrolyte imbalance.
2. Hypotension, which is being managed with vasopressors and fluid restriction.
3. Anemia, which has been treated with transfusions.
4. Hypercalcemia, which has resolved after treatment with pamidronate.
5. Ventricular tachycardia, which has been treated with amiodarone and discontinuation of central venous line.
6. Acute heart failure, which has been treated with beta blockers and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory arrest or death.
2. Worsening AKI, which could lead to end-stage renal disease or death.
3. Hypotension, which could lead to organ dysfunction or death.
4. Anemia, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
5. Hypercalcemia, which could recur if not properly managed.
6. Ventricular tachycardia, which could lead to cardiac arrest or death if not properly managed.
7. Acute heart failure, which could lead to cardiac arrest or death if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further decline.
2. Continue to manage the patient's AKI with fluid restriction, diuretics, and consideration of renal replacement therapy if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with vasopressors and fluid restriction.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further complications.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypercalcemia with pamidronate and close monitoring of calcium levels.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's ventricular tachycardia and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further episodes.
7. Continue to manage the patient's acute heart failure with beta blockers, diuretics, and close monitoring of cardiac function.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her multiple medical complications to prevent further decline and improve her chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]

   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ATN): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened, and they have been experiencing hypernatremia, which may be due to contraction alkalosis. Gentle hydration and monitoring of electrolytes and creatinine levels are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 60, and they are on pressors. Avoiding fluid boluses and weaning pressors as able are necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Acute Heart Failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. However, continued monitoring and management of cardiac function are necessary.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which may be triggered by CVL in the RV or recent ischemic event. Monitoring and management of this condition are necessary to prevent further episodes.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia has resolved, but monitoring of PTH and PTHrP levels is necessary to ensure that the condition does not recur.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable since the last transfusion, but continued monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but continued monitoring and management of respiratory function are necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and they have had a pleural effusion. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and management of the pleural effusion are necessary.
9. Malignancy: The patient has a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and will require ongoing management and follow-up with oncology.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has been prescribed atorvastatin 80 mg/day to manage their hyperlipidemia.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is necessary:

1. Continue to monitor and manage the patient's cardiac function, including cardiac enzymes and echocardiograms.
2. Monitor and manage the patient's respiratory function, including oxygen saturation and ventilator settings.
3. Monitor and manage the patient's renal function, including creatinine levels and electrolytes.
4. Monitor and manage the patient's hemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements.
5. Monitor and manage the patient's hyperlipidemia, including lipid profiles and statin therapy.
6. Monitor and manage the patient's sepsis, including WBC count and inflammatory markers.
7. Monitor and manage the patient's malignancy, including oncology follow-up and treatment.
8. Continue to provide pulmonary toilet and wean sedation as able.
9. Continue to monitor and manage the patient's agitation, including antipsychotics and sedation.
10. Continue to monitor and manage the patient's pain, including analgesics and sedation."

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better

   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute heart failure (AHF). The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in her vital signs, lab results, and medical interventions.

The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, with ongoing respiratory failure and a need for mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation has been stable, but her respiratory rate and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) have been increasing. The patient's lung parenchymal abnormalities and pleural effusion are likely contributing to her respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiac status is also a concern, with new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Her cardiac enzymes have shown a flat trend, indicating that the acute episode has passed. However, her ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient's renal function remains impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. Her urine output has been good, but her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and contraction alkalosis. Her anemia is being managed with transfusions, and her hemoglobin level has improved to 18.3 g/dL.

The patient's hypercalcemia has resolved, and her hyperlipidemia is being managed with atorvastatin. Her ventricular tachycardia (VT) has ceased, and her cardiac enzymes have shown a flat trend.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure can lead to further decline in her oxygenation and respiratory function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's new infarct and ongoing cardiac dysfunction can lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ongoing AKI can lead to further decline in her renal function, requiring dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.
4. Anemia: The patient's ongoing anemia can lead to further decline in her hemoglobin level, requiring further transfusions or other management strategies.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's ongoing hyperlipidemia can lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's ongoing VT can lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death.

Overall, the patient's condition remains unstable, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - pending family meeting for goals of care (preped for extubation)
   .
   Anemia
 guiac positive stool, modest response to transfusion
   - trend
   - family meeting
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities and pleural effusion.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including:

1. Acute renal failure (ATN) with worsening creatinine, likely due to contrast-induced and pre-renal etiology.
2. Hypernatremia, which was managed with gentle IVF and free water.
3. Hypotension, which is being managed with pressors and fluid restriction to avoid worsening acute renal failure.
4. Acute heart failure, likely due to a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which has been treated with beta-blockers and is being monitored.
5. Ventricular tachycardia, which was likely triggered by a central venous line (CVL) or recent ischemic event, and has been treated with amiodarone.
6. Hypercalcemia, which has been treated with pamidronate and is resolving.
7. Anemia, which has been managed with transfusions and is being monitored.
8. Hyperlipidemia, which has been treated with atorvastatin.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Meropenem
* Fentanyl
* Norepinephrine
* Haloperidol (Haldol)
* Aspirin
* Statin (atorvastatin)

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 18.9-22.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.6-9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 104-119 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.0-2.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 32-39 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium (Na+): 146-148 mmol/L, potassium (K+): 4.0-4.8 mmol/L, chloride (Cl-): 107-110 mmol/L
* Glucose: 159-181 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 194 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued treatment of respiratory failure with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and oxygen therapy.
* Management of acute renal failure with gentle IVF and fluid restriction.
* Treatment of hypernatremia with gentle IVF and free water.
* Monitoring of heart function with echocardiography and cardiac enzymes.
* Treatment of ventricular tachycardia with amiodarone and monitoring.
* Monitoring of anemia with serial hemoglobin levels and transfusions as needed.
* Treatment of hyperlipidemia with atorvastatin.
* Family meeting for goals of care and disposition planning.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.  Will discuss direction
   of care
 HCP states patient would not want trach.  [**Month (only) 11**] move to
   extubation attempt
 will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.  Will discuss direction

   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC, currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The patient's condition is multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.

The patient has received 2U PRBC for worsening anemia and has been treated with vasopressors to maintain BP control. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal LFTs. The patient's medications include fentanyl, norepinephrine, and antibiotics for pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/56 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is already critical, and any further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent GI bleed increase the risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and decreased urine output increase the risk of further renal damage and failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent GI bleed and ongoing tube feeds increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or obstruction.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's agitation and recent respiratory failure increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

The patient's care plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, antibiotics for pneumonia, and vasopressors to maintain BP control. The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeds, and the patient's glycemic control is being monitored. The patient's code status is DNR, and the patient's disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and newly diagnosed NSCLC who is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a multifactorial respiratory failure, including RLL lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction. The patient has poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and has an unfavorable respiratory system resistance index (RSBI).

The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for worsening anemia and has been treated with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure control. The patient has also received antibiotics for pneumonia and has a right pleural effusion that was drained via thoracentesis and pigtail placement.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including acute renal failure, CHF, and ventricular tachycardia, which have been managed with various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may spread to other parts of the lung and lead to further complications.
3. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a right pleural effusion that may re-accumulate and require further drainage.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
5. CHF: The patient has CHF, which may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has had an episode of ventricular tachycardia, which may recur if not managed properly.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Lung cancer: The patient has a diagnosis of lung cancer, which may spread to other parts of the body and lead to further complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is assessed as poor, with limited progress to date. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, monitor for re-accumulation of the right pleural effusion, and manage the patient's other medical conditions. The patient's family has been informed of the patient's condition and has been advised to discuss the direction of care with the healthcare team. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is to be discharged to the ICU."

   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated

   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
* She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and possible acute kidney injury.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 134/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
* She has a history of anemia, which is being managed with transfusions.
* She has acute renal failure, which is likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy and pre-renal etiology.
* She has a new anterior wall motion abnormality consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
* She has been treated with antibiotics for possible post-obstructive pneumonia and is being monitored for ventricular tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by her underlying lung disease and pleural effusion. Further exacerbation of her respiratory failure could lead to worsening hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy and pre-renal etiology. Further deterioration of her kidney function could lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's new anterior wall motion abnormality consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD artery could lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's antibiotic treatment for possible post-obstructive pneumonia should be continued and monitored to prevent further infection and sepsis.
* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia could lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying conditions to prevent further complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-inch tall male who weighs 67.8 kg, with a current temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F) and a heart rate of 106 bpm. The patient's blood pressure is 134/55 mmHg, and his respiratory rate is 26 inspirations per minute. His oxygen saturation is 94%, and he is receiving oxygen therapy through an endotracheal tube.

The patient has a history of chronic anemia, hypertension, and chronic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. He also has a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 638 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 21.4
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 163 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results, including electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving medications for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and respiratory failure. He is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia
* Heart failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock
* Anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction
* Hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, seizures, and coma
* Hypotension, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and shock

The patient's current condition is stable, but close monitoring and management of his conditions are necessary to prevent complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Plam move to extubation attempt
   will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* Respiratory failure is the primary concern, with the patient remaining intubated and mechanically ventilated.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 124/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
* The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is contributing to the respiratory failure.
* The patient has undergone thoracentesis and pigtail placement for a right pleural effusion, which has been discontinued.
* The patient is receiving empiric treatment for pneumonia related to lung cancer.
* Agitation has been treated with antipsychotics.
* Hypotension is improving slowly, and vasopressors are being used as needed.
* Nutritional support is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at goal.
* Acute renal failure is being managed with a lasix drip, and the patient is being monitored for urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.
* Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode of myocardial infarction (MI) has passed.
* The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% on repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE).
* Ventricular tachycardia has resolved, and the patient is being monitored for any further episodes.
* Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated AST and ALT levels, which are resolving.
* Anemia is being managed with packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and the patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is being trended.
* The patient has a diagnosis of lung cancer and is not currently being considered for intervention while in the ICU. Chemotherapy will be considered if the patient is able to tolerate extubation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent MI may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent GI bleed may increase the risk of further bleeding complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and respiratory failure may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or encephalopathy.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's hypotension and anemia may lead to metabolic complications such as electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Plan move to extubation attempt
   will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to multifactorial causes including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 124/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 468 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has several medical conditions, including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He is receiving treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin and meropenem, and his nutritional support is provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, and he is receiving lasix drip to maintain urine output. His cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode of MI has passed. His LVEF has improved to 45% on repeat echocardiogram.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is also at risk for bleeding due to his anemia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, and monitoring for re-accumulation of right pleural effusion. He will also receive antipsychotics for agitation, vasopressors for hypotension, and lasix drip to maintain urine output. His nutritional support will continue through TPN, and he will receive regular blood transfusions to maintain his hemoglobin level.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction, and an exudative effusion of presumed malignant or infectious etiology.

The patient has been on invasive ventilation for over two weeks, but showed no improvement or ability to wean off the ventilator. After discussions with the healthcare provider and the patient's family, it was decided to perform a terminal extubation and make the patient comfort measures only.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.4, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 638 K/uL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient has a PICC line in place for access, and is receiving morphine for pain management. She is also on a glycolytic control protocol to manage her blood glucose levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying NSCLC, and may worsen without further treatment.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's new systolic heart dysfunction and possible LAD infarct may lead to further cardiovascular instability.
3. Infection: The patient's exudative effusion may be due to an infectious etiology, which could lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and her underlying cardiovascular disease may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and her use of tube feeds may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.
6. Psychological distress: The patient's terminal illness and limited treatment options may lead to psychological distress for both the patient and her family.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 81-year-old female, is a candidate for comfort measures only (CMO) after failing to wean off ventilator support despite two weeks of therapy. She has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Her current condition is complicated by respiratory failure, likely due to NSCLC and/or new acute heart failure, as well as an exudative effusion of uncertain etiology. The patient has been extubated and is currently receiving morphine via a gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure or complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's new systolic heart dysfunction and potential left anterior descending (LAD) infarct increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory failure increase her risk of developing infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, or other opportunistic infections.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of morphine and potential gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and her risk of developing hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock is high.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's use of diuretics and potential electrolyte imbalances may lead to complications such as hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, or other electrolyte disorders.
7. Pain management: The patient's use of morphine may lead to respiratory depression, sedation, or other adverse effects, and her pain management needs to be carefully monitored and managed.
8. Terminal extubation: The patient's decision to discontinue life-sustaining therapy (LST) and transition to comfort measures only (CMO) increases her risk of developing respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia, during the transition period."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently comfortable. He has a right pleural effusion, pneumonia, and atelectasis, which are contributing to his respiratory failure. The patient's lung cancer is being treated with comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, and it is essential to continue monitoring his oxygenation and ventilation status. The risk of respiratory failure is high, and the patient may require mechanical ventilation if his condition worsens.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is related to his lung cancer, and it is essential to continue treating it with antibiotics. The risk of pneumonia progression and sepsis is high, and the patient may require additional treatment, such as bronchoscopy or surgical drainage.
3. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient's right pleural effusion was drained, but it is essential to monitor his symptoms and chest tube output to prevent recurrence. The risk of pleural effusion recurrence is high, and the patient may require additional drainage procedures.
4. Atelectasis: The patient's atelectasis is a complication of his lung cancer and pneumonia. It is essential to monitor his lung function and oxygenation status to prevent further atelectasis.
5. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional support is limited, and it is essential to monitor his nutritional status and provide adequate caloric intake to prevent malnutrition.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control is critical, and it is essential to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
7. Lines and Prophylaxis: The patient has a PICC line and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). It is essential to monitor his line site and provide prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.
8. Code Status: The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), which means that he will not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation if his heart or breathing stops. It is essential to discuss his code status with his family and ensure that they understand his wishes.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical treatment to prevent complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient was extubated last evening and appears comfortable. The patient is unable to provide a history due to being unresponsive. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/41 mmHg. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate for pain and lorazepam for agitation.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a SpO2 of 85% and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation and oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and endotracheal tube. The patient's ABG results are pending.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and the patient may be at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may worsen the patient's respiratory status.
3. Lung cancer: The patient has a diagnosis of NSCLC, which may progress and worsen the patient's respiratory status.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a right pleural effusion, which may worsen the patient's respiratory status.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH may indicate the presence of sepsis.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and depressed LV ejection fraction, which may increase the patient's risk of cardiac complications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pain and agitation with morphine sulfate and lorazepam.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including the patient's white blood cell count, platelet count, and LDH.
4. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a chest CT scan, to determine the extent of the patient's lung cancer and pleural effusion.
5. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist or oncologist to further manage the patient's respiratory and lung cancer treatment.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac complications."
