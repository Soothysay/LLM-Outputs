   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with GPC bacteremia
   and neck pain.
   .
   1. Bacteremia. High-grade given that 2/2 bottles turned positive rather
   quickly. Unclear what the source is. MRI showed fluid collections
   around L4/5 similar to those seen last [**Month (only) 705**] just prior to his last
   admission for his abscesses but w/o clear signs of abscess. Hx for neck
   pain, mild HA, and fevers raises concern for meningitis, though he
   looks unusually well for this to be bact meningitis and
   Brudzinski/Kernig were neg. LP was not done in the ED given MR results
   and concern for spinal infection possible seeding into CSF with LP.
   Ceftriaxone and vanc were started in ED at meningitis doses.
   Endocarditis is also concerning given the history of valvular disease
   (through no clear murmur noted). Incomplete treatment of/recurrent
   osteomyelitis is also likely though pt had been on cefazolin for 8wks
   following prior admission ([**8-2**])
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin given positive cultures; if returns MSSA can
   switch to better [**Doctor Last Name **] for sensitive staph (has received cephalosporins
   in the past)
   - f/u ID recs re LP recs and utility -> would need to do via IR given
   MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7704**]
   - f/u MRI to determine if there is a clear source in spine; appreciate
   spine recs
   - f/u TTE
   - consider head MR (+/- contrast) given paraesthesias (see below)
   .
   2. Neck pain. Has had recurrent neck pain since initial hosp in [**March 2148**]. intensive PT has improved function/strength until recently.
   Limited ROM new to current presentation. Managed now on 8mg morphine
   Q4h. Given hx, concerning for recurrent epidural abscess.
   Trauma/compression fx also possible in light of previous C-spine
   disease. MSK etiology possible given intensive PT regimen and recent
   history of fall.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine PRN
   - f/u final read of C-spine MR
   .
   3. Paraesthesia. Possibly related to fall and/or known cervical
   disease. Other than subjective difference in sensation, exam is
   generally unremarkable with good strength. Concerning for peripheral
   (i.e c-spine stenosis/nerve compression) vs. central etiologies
   (infarct/abscess). Given apparent involvement of entire R side and hx,
   particularly concerned about a central process such as brain abscesses
   - f/u C-spine final read
   - head MR (+/- contrast) to assess brain lesion (infarct/abscess)
   .
   4. Anemia. Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   .
   5. Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple MSSA infections, currently admitted to the ICU with bacteremia, neck pain, and paraesthesia. He has a history of valvular disease and has been treated with cefazolin for 8 weeks following a previous admission. He has also had recurrent neck pain since his initial hospitalization in March 2148. The patient's current condition includes:

* Bacteremia with high-grade positive blood cultures
* Neck pain with limited ROM and concern for recurrent epidural abscess or compression fracture
* Paraesthesia possibly related to fall and/or known cervical disease
* Anemia, which is likely caused by chronic inflammation
* Acute renal failure, which may be related to NSAID use and previous history of hemodialysis
* Hyperglycemia, which may require starting HISS therapy
* Hypertension, which is being managed with home dose metoprolol
* GERD, which is being managed with Prilosec

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including neck pain, fever, and altered mental status, raise concern for meningitis. A lumbar puncture was not performed due to the concern for spinal infection.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's history of valvular disease and positive blood cultures raise concern for endocarditis.
3. Recurrent epidural abscess: The patient's history of recurrent neck pain and limited ROM raise concern for recurrent epidural abscess.
4. Compression fracture: The patient's history of cervical spine disease and limited ROM raise concern for compression fracture.
5. Brain abscess: The patient's symptoms, including paraesthesia and altered mental status, raise concern for brain abscess.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed promptly.
7. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's hyperglycemia may require urgent management to prevent complications.
8. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may require urgent management to prevent complications.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat blood cultures to determine the source of the bacteremia.
2. Continue vancomycin given positive cultures, and consider switching to a more effective antibiotic if the cultures return positive for MSSA.
3. Consider a head MRI with contrast to assess for brain abscess or infarct.
4. Follow up on the patient's cervical spine MRI to determine if there is a clear source of the infection.
5. Manage the patient's neck pain with morphine and consider a cervical spine specialist consult.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider hemodialysis if necessary.
7. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with HISS therapy if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adjusting medications as necessary."

   # Hypoxia:  Appears to be secondary to shunt physiology, most likely
   secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given
   new evidence off septic emboli this AM.  Also, additionally volume
   overload may play a role.   No evidence of meth-hemoglobinemia or
   carboxyhemoglobin.
   -          Will work up bacteremia as below
   -          Will diurese with IV lasix today, goal 2L negative
   .
   # Bacteremia.   High-grade MSSA.  Concerning for L5-S1 osteomyelitis as
   nitus of infection given new endplate destruction and discitis.
   Endocarditis definitely concerning, given TTE shows dilated RA more so
   than before, concern for worsening mitral stenosis from endocarditis or
   seeding of the tricuspid valve.
   - Repeat blood cultures daily
   - Continue meropenem and cefazolin per ID
   - TEE today, will likely need intubation prior given level of hypoxia
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u ortho recs regarding spinal osteo
   .
   # Neck pain/Paraesthesia:   Ortho consulted likely secondary to chronic
   degenerative C-spine disease.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine and oxycodone PRN, if not well controlled, consider using
   PCA
   - Lidocaine patch to neck today
   - Monitor neuro exams

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:  ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple MSSA infections, currently presenting with GPC bacteremia and neck pain. The patient is in the ICU due to hypoxia, likely secondary to shunt physiology and septic emboli from progressive endocarditis. The patient has a high-grade MSSA bacteremia, which is concerning for L5-S1 osteomyelitis and endocarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of mitral stenosis due to endocarditis or seeding of the tricuspid valve.
2. Development of L5-S1 osteomyelitis and discitis.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hypoxia and septic emboli.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to volume overload, sepsis, and potential nephrotoxicity of antibiotics.
5. Hyperglycemia due to stress response and potential insulin resistance.
6. Hypertension due to chronic kidney disease, pain, and stress response.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration and potential coagulopathy.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
9. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias.
10. Neurological complications, such as meningitis or spinal cord compression, due to septic emboli and endocarditis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Repeat blood cultures daily.
2. Continuation of meropenem and cefazolin per ID.
3. TEE today, likely requiring intubation prior to the procedure.
4. f/u ID recs regarding endocarditis and bacteremia.
5. f/u ortho recs regarding spinal osteo.
6. Monitoring of neuro exams.
7. Volume restriction and diuresis to manage hyponatremia.
8. Holding NSAIDs and encouraging PO intake to manage acute renal failure.
9. Monitoring of urine and serum electrolytes daily.
10. Starting HISS if hyperglycemia persists.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with MSSA
   Endocarditis and neck pain.
   # Hypoxia:  Appears to be secondary to shunt physiology, most likely
   secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given
   new evidence off septic emboli this AM.
   -Will work up bacteremia as below
   -          Consider diureses today with 40mg IV lasix today, goal 2L
   negative
   # Endocarditis.   High-grade MSSA.  Vegitations on Mitral Valve per
   TEE.
   - Repeat blood cultures Q48
   - Continue gentamicin per ID
   - Nafcillin desensitization today
 Nafcillin dosing for MSSA
   - f/u ID recs
   # Neck pain/Paraesthesia:   Ortho consulted likely secondary to chronic
   degenerative C-spine disease.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine and valium PRN
   - D/C lidocaine patch to neck today
   - Monitor neuro exams
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to either SIADH in the setting of
   pain and pulmonary process or hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of CHF.
   -          Received fluid bolus yesterday and worsened, will volume
   restrict and diurese now
   #. Anemia:  Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   # Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily
   #. Hyperglycemia. BS elevated on prior admissions but not on therapy.
   - If persists, will start HISS
   #. Hypertension. Continue home dose metoprolol.
   #. GERD. Continue Prilosec.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with MSSA
   Endocarditis and neck pain.
   # Hypoxia:  Appears to be secondary to shunt physiology, most likely
   secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given
   new evidence off septic emboli this AM.
   -Will work up bacteremia as below
   -          Consider diureses today with 40mg IV lasix today, goal 2L
   negative
   # Endocarditis.   High-grade MSSA.  Vegitations on Mitral Valve per
   TEE.
   - Repeat blood cultures Q48
   - Continue gentamicin per ID
   - Nafcillin desensitization today
 Nafcillin dosing for MSSA
   - f/u ID recs
   # Neck pain/Paraesthesia:   Ortho consulted likely secondary to chronic
   degenerative C-spine disease.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine and valium PRN
   - D/C lidocaine patch to neck today
   - Monitor neuro exams
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to either SIADH in the setting of
   pain and pulmonary process or hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of CHF.
   -          Received fluid bolus yesterday and worsened, will volume
   restrict and diurese now
   #. Anemia:  Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   # Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily
   #. Hyperglycemia. BS elevated on prior admissions but not on therapy.
   - If persists, will start HISS
   #. Hypertension. Continue home dose metoprolol.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections, now presenting with MSSA endocarditis and neck pain. He was intubated and extubated without difficulty, and is currently on a regimen of antibiotics, including gentamicin and nafcillin. He has hyponatremia, anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia, and is being managed with fluid restriction, diuresis, and close monitoring of laboratory values.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing bacteremia and endocarditis increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Endocarditis-related complications: The patient's high-grade MSSA endocarditis may lead to further complications, such as valve perforation, abscess formation, or cardiac tamponade.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or the need for dialysis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neck pain and paraesthesia may be indicative of cervical spine disease, which could lead to spinal cord compression or other neurological complications.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's pneumonia and septic emboli increase the risk of respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Infection control issues: The patient's ongoing bacteremia and endocarditis create a risk of transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.
7. Medication-related complications: The patient's multiple medications, including antibiotics and diuretics, may interact with each other or cause adverse effects.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's anemia and ongoing inflammatory response may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or other complications.
10. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac failure or stroke.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his progress and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 94% on CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show mild hyponatremia, and their electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, with a platelet count of 209 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an AST of 34 IU/L and an ALT of 23 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies show progression of right lung opacity, likely representing pneumonia. The echocardiogram reveals a moderate-sized mitral valve vegetation without significant mitral regurgitation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's mitral valve vegetation may lead to endocarditis, which can cause further valve damage or systemic complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and endocarditis may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ failure.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid restriction may not be sufficient, leading to fluid overload and cardiac compromise.
5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures.
6. Renal failure: The patient's mild hyponatremia and electrolyte imbalance may indicate early renal failure.
7. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's mildly elevated liver enzymes may indicate early hepatic dysfunction.

These potential complications require close monitoring and early intervention to prevent worsening of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with MSSA
   Endocarditis and neck pain.
   # Hypoxia:  Appears to be secondary to shunt physiology, most likely
   secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given
   new evidence off septic emboli this AM.
   -Will work up bacteremia as below
   -          Consider diureses today with IV lasix today, goal 2L
   negative
   # Endocarditis.   High-grade MSSA.  Vegitations on Mitral Valve per
   TEE.
   - Repeat blood cultures daily
   - Continue gentamicin and cefazolin per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u ortho recs regarding spinal osteo
   # Neck pain/Paraesthesia:   Ortho consulted likely secondary to chronic
   degenerative C-spine disease.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine and oxycodone PRN, if not well controlled, consider using
   PCA
   - Lidocaine patch to neck today
   - Monitor neuro exams
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to either SIADH in the setting of
   pain and pulmonary process or hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of CHF.
   -          Received fluid bolus yesterday and worsened, will volume
   restrict and diurese now
   #. Anemia:  Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   # Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily
   #. Hyperglycemia. BS elevated on prior admissions but not on therapy.
   - If persists, will start HISS
   #. Hypertension. Continue home dose metoprolol.
   #. GERD. Continue Prilosec.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections, now presenting with MSSA endocarditis and neck pain. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has high-grade MSSA endocarditis with vegetations on the mitral valve, which is likely to progress and lead to further complications.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to shunt physiology, which may be exacerbated by septic emboli from progressive endocarditis.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely secondary to either SIADH or hypervolemic hyponatremia, which may be worsened by fluid boluses and diuretic therapy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely caused by chronic inflammation, which may be exacerbated by ongoing infection and inflammation.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may be caused by NSAID use, dehydration, and underlying kidney disease.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be caused by stress, infection, or underlying insulin resistance.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be caused by underlying kidney disease, fluid overload, or medication.
8. GERD: The patient's GERD may be exacerbated by medication, position, or underlying esophageal motility disorders.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Progression of endocarditis: The patient's endocarditis may worsen, leading to further complications such as valve rupture, abscess formation, or embolic events.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to multi-organ failure, shock, or death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to ventilator dependence or death.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or death.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease or death.
6. Infection: The patient may develop secondary infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections.
7. Bleeding: The patient may develop bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for endocarditis and bacteremia.
2. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
3. Aggressive fluid management to prevent hyponatremia and acute renal failure.
4. Pain management with morphine and oxycodone.
5. Monitoring of neurologic status and consideration of spinal osteo consultation.
6. Consideration of diuresis and fluid restriction to manage hyponatremia.
7. Monitoring of blood glucose levels and consideration of insulin therapy if necessary.
8. Monitoring of blood pressure and consideration of antihypertensive therapy if necessary.
9. Consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
10. Regular communication with the patient and family to ensure informed decision-making."
