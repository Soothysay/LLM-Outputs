   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a  80 year old female with severe COPD, diabetes, lung
   cancer, morbid obesity, who presents to ICU s/p ERCP in setting of
   hypoxia and reintubation
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Hypotension
   Differential includes myocardial infarction, aspiration in setting post
   procedure, COPD exacerbation/OSA, early sepsis given ERCP and possible
   bacteremia, pulmonary edema although less likely given chest
   radiograph. Pancreatitis post ERCP causing ARDS is also less likely
   given clinical picture. Also may have had mucus plug and component of
   atelectasis given her body habitus.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - pan culture blood, urine, sputum
   - will cover with levo/flagyl to cover for pulmonary and biliary
   process
   - add on diff
   - TTE to assess EF and WMO
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - nebulizer treatments
   - wean down ventilator settings in hope of early extubation, will
   foloow ABG closely and wean sedation in AM to plan for RSBI, patient
   did excellent on PS trial, will rest o/n on AC and plan to switch back
   to PS at 0400 with plan to extubate in AM
   - volume challenge with normal saline for HoTN although suspect this is
   sedation/med related and less likely to be sepsis
   - hold anti-hypertensives
   - hold diuretic overnight
   .
   #. COPD
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - hold off on steroids
   - outpatient sleep study to assess for OSA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with severe COPD, diabetes, lung cancer, and morbid obesity, who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and reintubation following ERCP.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 72 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Spontaneous respiratory rate: 2 ipm

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 96 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her morbid obesity and lack of cooperation. However, her skin and neurologic examinations are not assessed.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray (CXR), show enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with prominence of interstitial markings consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is also hyperexpansion of the lungs, suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease, and blunting of the left costophrenic angle with some basilar opacification, consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic change.

The patient's differential diagnosis includes:

* Hypoxia/hypotension: myocardial infarction, aspiration, COPD exacerbation, early sepsis, pulmonary edema, and mucus plug with atelectasis
* Leukocytosis: stress response after ERCP
* COPD: exacerbation and OSA
* Lung cancer: possible spread to other organs
* Diabetes: hyperglycemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat CXR in the morning
* Pan culture blood, urine, and sputum
* Cover with levo/flagyl to cover for pulmonary and biliary processes
* Add on diff
* TTE to assess EF and WMO
* Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
* Repeat ECG in the morning
* Nebulizer treatments
* Wean down ventilator settings in hope of early extubation
* Volume challenge with normal saline for hypotension
* Hold anti-hypertensives
* Hold diuretic overnight

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* Pneumonia
* Pleural effusion
* Pulmonary edema
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Lung cancer progression
* COPD exacerbation
* OSA
* Mucus plug and atelectasis
* Stress response after ERCP
* Pancreatitis post ERCP
* ARDS
* VAP
* DVT
* Stress ulcer
* Pulmonary embolism
* Cardiac tamponade
* Myocardial infarction

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* ECG: EKG shows Hr 79, SR, LAD, no STE/STD, Q wave in v1-v3 (old), higher T waves in II, III, and AVF

**Assessment and Plan**

* NSTEMI/cardiac ischemia: Cardiac enzymes are positive, patient sedated and not currently complaining of CP, EKG does not show ST changes
* Hypoxia/Hypotension: Likely due to acute myocardial ischemia and diastolic dysfunction causing increasing pulmonary edema
* COPD: Continue nebulizer treatments, hold off on steroids, outpatient sleep study to assess for OSA
* Anemia: Hct steadily declining, send type & screen, recheck around noon and consider transfusing
* Leukocytosis: Trending down, suspect [**12-30**] stress response after ERCP, will cover empirically with levo/flagyl overnight
* Diabetes: Place on SSI
* Lung cancer: S/p LLL resection, did not receive any chemo or XRT
* FEN: NPO

**Potential Medical Complications**

* Cardiac complications: NSTEMI, cardiac ischemia, diastolic dysfunction
* Respiratory complications: Hypoxia, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema
* Infectious complications: Sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection
* Hematological complications: Anemia, leukocytosis
* Endocrine complications: Diabetes, hyperglycemia
* Cancer complications: Recurrence, metastasis

**ICU Care**

* Nutrition: Glycemic control, lines: arterial line, 16 Gauge, 20 Gauge
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, VAP
* Comments: Communication, code status: Full code, disposition: ICU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 71 bpm (66-86)
* Blood pressure: 112/62 mmHg (81-133/74-97)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.7 K/uL
* Hct: 32.3%
* Plt: 237 K/uL
* Cr: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.81 ng/mL
* CK: 308 IU/L
* CKMB: 4.9 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24 mmol/L
* Glucose: 136 mg/dL

The patient's chest radiograph shows lung volumes that are a little lower compared to previous, with no obvious infiltrate or effusion. The endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.4 cm above the carina.

The patient's ECG shows enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with prominence of interstitial markings consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Some hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests underlying chronic pulmonary disease.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxia/hypotension: Repeat CXR in the morning, pan culture blood, urine, and sputum, and cover with levo/flagyl to cover for pulmonary and biliary processes.
* COPD: Continue nebulizer treatments and hold off on steroids.
* Leukocytosis: Suspect stress response after ERCP, but will cover empirically with levo/flagyl overnight.
* Diabetes: Place on SSI.
* Lung cancer: S/p LLL resection, did not receive any chemo or XRT.
* FEN: NPO.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Myocardial infarction
* Aspiration in setting post procedure
* COPD exacerbation/OSA
* Early sepsis given ERCP and possible bacteremia
* Pulmonary edema
* Pancreatitis post ERCP causing ARDS
* Mucus plug and atelectasis given her body habitus

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and chest radiograph closely to ensure early detection and management of any potential complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Approx 1 hr after extubation, patient began having respiratory distress
   c/b tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency.  She was not
   hypoxic, but clinically was in acute pulmonary edema.  She was treated
   initially with lisinopril and IV lopressor without improvement in her
   BP.  Widened QRS complexes and ST segment changes were noted on
   telemetry. 12-lead EKG showed evolving ischemia. She was given oxygen,
   aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and was started on a nitro
   gtt when her BP remained markedly elevated. Nitro was uptitrated with
   gradual resolution of HTN, but the patient remained in resp distress
   and was reintubated.  Cardiology consultation was obtained, but
   ischemia was thought to be rate-related and acute intervention was
   deferred.  She was subsequently treated with heparin gtt, plavix,
   aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w hypoxia,
   reintubated for acute respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory distress
 Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Compromised LV filling due to HR led to acute pulm
   edema and worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic
   diastolic dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation,
   ventilation on current settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60; may uptitrate PEEP to improve
   oxygenation while decr. FiO2
   -Gentle diuresis as BP tolerates
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS.
   No acute intervention warranted, will cont. medical therapy
   -trend troponin to peak
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
   -ASA, plavix
   -titrate lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -TTE today to also eval. for WMA, stunned myocardium
   -cards aware of pt
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Hypotension
 likely due to acute myocardial ischemia and
   diastolic dysfunction causing increasing pulmonary edema.  Possible
   that her epigastric pain was actually referred myocardial ischemia.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - pan culture blood, urine, sputum
   - will d/c abx as patient is afebrile and wbc trending down and low
   suspicion of infection.
   - TTE to assess EF and WMO
   - nebulizer treatments
   - wean sedation to plan for RSBI and PSV.  Will try to optimize HR and
   BP control prior to extubation.
   - volume challenge with normal saline for HoTN although suspect this is
   sedation/med related and less likely to be sepsis
   - patient
s only anti-HTN med as outpatient is lasix 40 mg PO daily
   consider adding back lasix if patient
s BP tolerates the Beta-blocker
   as it will help with pulm edema.
   .
   #. COPD
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - hold off on steroids
   - outpatient sleep study to assess for OSA
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct steadily declining.
   - send type & screen,
   - recheck around noon and consider transfusing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #Respiratory distress
 Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Compromised LV filling due to HR led to acute pulm
   edema and worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic
   diastolic dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation,
   ventilation on current settings.
   -Cont. full vent support

   oxygenation while decr. FiO2
   -Gentle diuresis as BP tolerates

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who was previously intubated and extubated, but developed respiratory distress and was reintubated. She has been experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency, with widened QRS complexes and ST segment changes on telemetry, indicating evolving ischemia. She was treated with oxygen, aspirin, morphine, and additional IV lopressor, and was started on a nitroglycerin drip, which was uptitrated to gradually resolve her hypertension.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16, and PEEP at 8 cmH2O. Her oxygenation is adequate, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 162.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Demand ischemia: Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once the patient was no longer distressed, tachycardic, and hypertensive, suggesting that the ischemia was likely caused by demand rather than acute coronary syndrome.
2. Hypoxia/hypotension: The patient's hypoxia and hypotension are likely caused by acute myocardial ischemia and diastolic dysfunction, which is causing increasing pulmonary edema.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is steadily declining, and she may require transfusion.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she may be experiencing a stress response after ERCP.
5. Diabetes: The patient has been placed on a sliding scale insulin (SSI) to control her blood glucose levels.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuation of full ventilator support.
2. Weaning of FiO2 to maintain a PO2 > 60, and uptitration of PEEP to improve oxygenation.
3. Gentle diuresis as the patient's blood pressure allows.
4. Trending of troponin to peak.
5. Heparin drip, goal PTT 60-80.
6. Aspirin and Plavix to prevent further cardiac events.
7. Titration of lopressor to a heart rate of 65 as the patient's blood pressure allows.
8. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to evaluate left ventricular function and wall motion abnormalities.
9. Repeat CXR in the morning.
10. Pan culture blood, urine, and sputum.
11. Weaning of sedation to plan for respiratory support and pressure support ventilation.
12. Volume challenge with normal saline for hypotension, although the patient's hypertension is suspected to be caused by sedation and medication rather than sepsis.
13. Consideration of adding back lasix to help with pulmonary edema.
14. Continue nebulizer treatments.
15. Hold off on steroids.
16. Outpatient sleep study to assess for obstructive sleep apnea.
17. Send type and screen, and recheck the patient's hematocrit around noon and consider transfusing.
18. Continue empiric coverage with levo and flagyl overnight, and pan culture the patient's blood and urine.
19. Place the patient on a sliding scale insulin (SSI) to control her blood glucose levels.
20. Elevate the patient's head of bed (HOB) to 30-45 degrees to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   24 Hour Events:
   Approx 1 hr after extubation, patient began having respiratory distress
   c/b tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency to 220
s/150
   She was not hypoxic, but clinically was in acute pulmonary edema.  She
   was treated initially with lisinopril and IV lopressor without
   improvement in her BP.  Widened QRS complexes and ST segment changes
   were noted on telemetry. 12-lead EKG showed evolving ischemia. She was
   given oxygen, aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and was
   started on a nitro gtt when her BP remained markedly elevated. Nitro
   was uptitrated with gradual resolution of HTN, but the patient remained
   in resp distress and was reintubated.  Cardiology consultation was
   obtained, but ischemia was thought to be rate-related and acute
   intervention was deferred.  She was subsequently treated with heparin
   gtt, plavix, aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w
   respiratory failure s/p ERCP, now with recurrent acute respiratory
   failure following trial of extubation.
   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation
 pt had similar event following ERCP.  Marked
   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
   -Aim to keep volume status even today
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   -[**Month (only) 60**] benefit from rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to
   maintain positive pressure
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS
   in the setting of presumed underlying CAD; no acute intervention
   warranted, will cont. medical therapy; goal SBP 90, goal HR 65
   -trend troponin to peak
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
   -full-dose ASA, plavix
   -titrate lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -TTE today to also eval. for WMA, stunned myocardium
   -cards aware of pt, will likely need elective cath when stable
   .
   #Hypotension
 fluid responsive; likely [**12-30**] sedation
   -IVF bolus, decr. sedation as tolerated if HoTN recurs
   -consider dopa vs. levophed for 1^st line pressor if HoTN refractory to
   IVF
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Does not appear to be overwhelmingly infected although
   new RLL process invokes PNA vs. pneumonitis.  Also dirty U/A. Likely
   element of reactive leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC, refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data
   available
   -f/u Cx data
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable, but on systemic AC
   - follow [**Hospital1 **]

   #ARF
 unclear b/l, has remained 1.3-1.4; may be element of ATN in the

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who was previously intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure following ERCP. The patient was recently extubated, but experienced respiratory distress, hypertension, and tachycardia within an hour of extubation. The patient was treated with lisinopril, IV lopressor, oxygen, aspirin, morphine, and nitro gtt, but remained in respiratory distress and was reintubated.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient's clinical presentation suggests acute pulmonary edema, which is likely caused by tachycardia and hypertension.
2. Ischemia: The patient's EKG showed evolving ischemia, which was thought to be rate-related and acute. However, the patient's condition did not worsen, and no acute intervention was deemed necessary.
3. Chronic lung disease: The patient has a history of chronic lung disease, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was significantly elevated, which may be contributing to her tachycardia and hypertension.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be contributing to her fatigue and shortness of breath.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuous mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Weaning of FiO2 to maintain a PO2 of greater than 60.
3. Aim to keep the patient's volume status even.
4. TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) today to evaluate for LV dysfunction.
5. Heparin gtt to maintain a PTT of 60-80.
6. Full-dose ASA and plavix to prevent further ischemia.
7. Titration of lopressor to maintain a heart rate of 65 as blood pressure allows.
8. Monitoring of troponin levels to peak.
9. Trending of WBC count to monitor for infection.
10. Monitoring of creatinine levels to monitor for acute kidney injury.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently being treated in the ICU."

   were noted on telemetry. 12-lead EKG showed evolving ischemia. She was
   given oxygen, aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and was
   started on a nitro gtt when her BP remained markedly elevated. Nitro
   was uptitrated with gradual resolution of HTN, but the patient remained
   in resp distress and was reintubated.  Cardiology consultation was
   obtained, but ischemia was thought to be rate-related and acute
   intervention was deferred.  She was subsequently treated with heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   improvement in her BP.  Widened QRS complexes and ST segment changes
   were noted on telemetry. 12-lead EKG showed evolving ischemia. She was
   given oxygen, aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and was
   started on a nitro gtt when her BP remained markedly elevated. Nitro
   was uptitrated with gradual resolution of HTN, but the patient remained
   in resp distress and was reintubated.  Cardiology consultation was
   obtained, but ischemia was thought to be rate-related and acute
   intervention was deferred.  She was subsequently treated with heparin
   gtt, plavix, aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w hypoxia,
   reintubated for acute respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory distress
 Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Compromised LV filling due to HR led to acute pulm
   edema and worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic
   diastolic dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation,
   ventilation on current settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60; may uptitrate PEEP to improve
   oxygenation while decr. FiO2
   -Gentle diuresis as BP tolerates
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS.
   No acute intervention warranted, will cont. medical therapy; goal SBP

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female who was reintubated for acute respiratory distress. She has a history of lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent. She developed marked hypertension in the setting of respiratory distress, which likely produced tachycardia and compromised LV filling, leading to acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.

The patient's condition is complicated by demand ischemia, which is likely reversible and not requiring acute intervention. She also has leukocytosis, which may be a reactive response to an underlying pulmonary infection, but is not yet clear. She carries a diagnosis of COPD, but no pulmonary function tests have been performed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. Her blood work also reveals anemia, which is stable, and diabetes, which is being managed with insulin.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being treated with a variety of medications, including heparin, aspirin, and lopressor. She is also receiving diuretics to manage her fluid balance and electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is already compromised, and further damage could lead to cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her prolonged bedrest and immobility.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and sputum cultures suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalances could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   # NSTEMI/cardiac ischemia
 cardiac enzymes are positive.  Patient
   sedated now and not currently complaining of CP.  EKG does not show ST
   changes.
   -heparin gtt
   -ASA PR/PO
   -Add lopressor 5mg IV q 6hrs daily
 convert to po when patient
   extubated
   -TTE today.
   -cards c/s
   -consider morphine and/or nitro for pain control as patient is weaned
   off sedation.
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Hypotension
 likely due to acute myocardial ischemia and
   diastolic dysfunction causing increasing pulmonary edema.  Possible
   that her epigastric pain was actually referred myocardial ischemia.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - pan culture blood, urine, sputum
   - will d/c abx as patient is afebrile and wbc trending down and low
   suspicion of infection.
   - TTE to assess EF and WMO
   - nebulizer treatments
   - wean sedation to plan for RSBI and PSV.  Will try to optimize HR and
   BP control prior to extubation.
   - volume challenge with normal saline for HoTN although suspect this is
   sedation/med related and less likely to be sepsis
   - patient
s only anti-HTN med as outpatient is lasix 40 mg PO daily
   consider adding back lasix if patient
s BP tolerates the Beta-blocker
   as it will help with pulm edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # NSTEMI/cardiac ischemia
 cardiac enzymes are positive.  Patient
   sedated now and not currently complaining of CP.  EKG does not show ST
   changes.
   -heparin gtt
   -ASA PR/PO
   -Add lopressor 5mg IV q 6hrs daily
 convert to po when patient
   extubated
   -TTE today.
   -cards c/s
   -consider morphine and/or nitro for pain control as patient is weaned
   off sedation.
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Hypotension
 likely due to acute myocardial ischemia and
   diastolic dysfunction causing increasing pulmonary edema.  Possible
   that her epigastric pain was actually referred myocardial ischemia.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - pan culture blood, urine, sputum
   - will d/c abx as patient is afebrile and wbc trending down and low
   suspicion of infection.
   - TTE to assess EF and WMO
   - nebulizer treatments
   - wean sedation to plan for RSBI and PSV.  Will try to optimize HR and
   BP control prior to extubation.
   - volume challenge with normal saline for HoTN although suspect this is
   sedation/med related and less likely to be sepsis
   - patient
s only anti-HTN med as outpatient is lasix 40 mg PO daily
   consider adding back lasix if patient
s BP tolerates the Beta-blocker
   as it will help with pulm edema.
   .
   #. COPD
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - hold off on steroids
   - outpatient sleep study to assess for OSA

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o abdominal pain, s/p elective ERCP, unremarkable but
   complicated by reintubatation with another extubation yesterday
   requiring reintubation in the setting of likely flash pulmonary edema.
   the etiology of the flash pulmonary edema remains unclear. likely
   contribution from cardial ischemia given positive troponin and ekg
   changes; unable to tolerate sudden withdrawal of positive pressure
   ventilation. waiting for TTE to elucidate the cause.
   plan:
   -medical managment of cad incling asa, heparin gtt
   -cardiology following, waiting for attending recs esp. re timing of
   cath if needed
   -no sbp today. waiting for additional cardiac work-up
   -new Right lower lobe process, infiltrate of fluid; will monitor for
   signs of infection such as fever, secretion. holding off on antibiotics
   for now
   -once cardiology plan is clarified, will need diuresis, possible
   initiation of nitro gtt prior to the next extubation attempt
   1)Respiratory Failure
patient with clear evolution of acute onset of
   pulmonary edema following extubation.  This is the second time that we
   have seen a sequence of
looking favorable for extubation
evolution of
   significant evidence of tachycardia/tachypnea/hypertension and then
   with likely elevations in LVEDP onset of acute hydrostatic pulmonary
   edema leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure.  In this setting there
   is signficant elevation of troponin and CK consistent with some
   myocardial ischemia and injury.  In addition, patient did have
   epigastic discomfort at the time raising the question of her pain being
   anginal in nature.   Although this is unlikely to represent acute
   coronary syndrome is may well represent significant fixed obstruction
   with signifiant obstruction to flow contributing to recurrent hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   -Currently on B-Blocker/Heparin/TNG with goal to diurese
   -Cardiology to consider timing of intervention based on this clinical
   scenario and overall clinical picture
   -Will maintain in A/C and move to wean to PSV when possible.
   -Will not move to SBT in the setting of active ishcemia and plan to
   maintain full support for minimum of 48 hours
   2)Pulmonary Infiltrate
Patient with repeated intubation and although no
   significant aspiration seen at the repeat intubation
aspiration is
   certainly a risk.  She does have a single GPC found in sputum culture.
   Her CXR shows evidence of new right lower lobe opacity with suggestion
   of small effusion.
   -Would favor antibiotics to start in the setting of new infiltrate,
   increased WBC count  should evolution of significant fever or sputum
   production be seen.
   -Will repeat CXR in AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 81-year-old female who was admitted with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She had an elective ERCP procedure, which was complicated by reintubation and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has been unstable, with repeated intubation and extubation attempts, and she has required reintubation due to worsening respiratory distress. She has also developed a new right lower lobe infiltrate and has a positive troponin and EKG changes, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to flash pulmonary edema, which can be caused by cardiac ischemia, fluid overload, or other factors. The patient's condition may worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. **Cardiac Ischemia:** The patient's positive troponin and EKG changes suggest possible cardiac ischemia, which can lead to further complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
3. **Pulmonary Infiltrate:** The patient's new right lower lobe infiltrate may be due to aspiration, infection, or other causes. If not treated promptly, this can lead to pneumonia, sepsis, or other complications.
4. **Infection:** The patient's WBC count is elevated, and she has a positive sputum culture, which increases the risk of infection.
5. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid balance is critical, and excessive fluid administration can worsen her respiratory failure and cardiac ischemia.
6. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may be related to the ERCP procedure or other factors, and may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** The patient's inability to eat and her need for tube feeds may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can impact her overall health and recovery.

**Plan:**

The patient's plan includes medical management of cardiac ischemia, cardiology follow-up, and further evaluation of the pulmonary infiltrate. The patient will require close monitoring and management of her respiratory and cardiac status, as well as nutrition and hydration."

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o abdominal pain, s/p elective ERCP, unremarkable but
   complicated by reintubatation with another extubation yesterday
   requiring reintubation in the setting of likely flash pulmonary edema.
   the etiology of the flash pulmonary edema remains unclear. likely
   contribution from cardial ischemia given positive troponin and ekg
   changes; unable to tolerate sudden withdrawal of positive pressure
   ventilation. waiting for TTE to elucidate the cause.
   plan:
   -medical managment of cad incling asa, heparin gtt
   -cardiology following, waiting for attending recs esp. re timing of
   cath if needed
   -no sbp today. waiting for additional cardiac work-up
   -new Right lower lobe process, infiltrate of fluid; will monitor for
   signs of infection such as fever, secretion. holding off on antibiotics
   for now
   -once cardiology plan is clarified, will need diuresis, possible
   initiation of nitro gtt prior to the next extubation attempt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She had undergone an elective ERCP and developed abdominal pain, which worsened after extubation and led to reintubation. She was found to have flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by cardiac ischemia, and was unable to tolerate sudden withdrawal of positive pressure ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.8°C, HR 68 bpm, BP 112/53 mmHg, RR 22 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 13 mmHg, HR 68 bpm.
* Fluid balance: Total input 2,445 mL, total output 865 mL, with a balance of 1,580 mL.
* Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, ventilator mode CMV/ASSIST, Vt 550 mL, RR 16, PEEP 8 cmH2O, FiO2 50%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 13.7, Hct 32.3, Plt 237, Cr 1.3, TropT 0.81, TCO2 25, Glucose 136.
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 16.0/64.0/1.4, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 772/16/0.71, Differential-Neuts 78.3%, Lymph 15.6%, Mono 4.7%, Eos 1.2%, Lactic Acid 1.4 mmol/L, Albumin 3.2 g/dL, Ca++ 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.1 mg/dL, PO4 2.8 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac ischemia and troponin elevation suggest a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and need for ventilator support increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, or respiratory acidosis.
3. Infection: The patient's new right lower lobe process and infiltrate of fluid increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte abnormalities suggest a risk of fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac complications, respiratory failure, or even death.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and recent ERCP increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis, perforation, or bleeding.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan is to:

1. Continue medical management of cardiac ischemia, including ASA and heparin gtt.
2. Wait for cardiology follow-up and attending recommendations, especially regarding the timing of catheterization if needed.
3. Monitor the patient for signs of infection, such as fever or secretion, and hold off on antibiotics for now.
4. Plan for diuresis and possible initiation of nitroglycerin gtt prior to the next extubation attempt.
5. Continue ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild mitral regurgitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w
   respiratory failure s/p ERCP, now with recurrent acute respiratory
   failure following trial of extubation.
   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation
 pt had similar event following ERCP.  Marked
   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
   -Aim to keep volume status even today
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   -[**Month (only) 60**] benefit from rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to
   maintain positive pressure
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS
   in the setting of presumed underlying CAD; no acute intervention
   warranted, will cont. medical therapy; goal SBP 90, goal HR 65; TTE
   showed preserved bivent fxn but incr. PCWP and mild AS, could not
   exclude WMA
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
   -full-dose ASA, plavix
   -titrate lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -diagnostic cath today, may require intervention
   .
   #Hypotension
 fluid responsive; likely [**12-30**] sedation
   -IVF bolus, decr. sedation as tolerated if HoTN recurs
   -consider dopa vs. levophed for 1st line pressor if HoTN refractory to
   IVF
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Does not appear to be overwhelmingly infected although
   new RLL process invokes PNA vs. pneumonitis.  Also dirty U/A. Likely
   element of reactive leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC, refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data
   available
   -f/u Cx data

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left lobectomy and is now home oxygen-dependent. She was admitted to the ICU due to recurrent acute respiratory failure following a trial of extubation. The patient has a background of chronic lung disease, hypertension, and diabetes. She is currently intubated and sedated, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her cardiac function is preserved, with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%. The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and minimal aortic valve stenosis.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 14.3
* Hct: 33.1
* Platelets: 225
* Creatinine: 1.4
* Troponin-T: 0.58
* TCO2: 27
* Glucose: 114
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.9/49.1/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 582/8/0.27, ALT/AST: 31/56, Alk Phos/T Bili: 58/0.5, Amylase/Lipase: 53/22, Differential-Neuts: 78.3%, Lymph: 15.6%, Mono: 4.7%, Eos: 1.2%, Fibrinogen: 638 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.2 g/dL, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 1.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation is compromised.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and minimal aortic valve stenosis. There is a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, particularly if the patient's cardiac function is compromised.
3. Infection: The patient has a new RLL opacity on CXR, which may indicate an infection. There is a risk of sepsis or organ failure if the infection is not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding. There is a risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient's platelet count is low.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney dysfunction. There is a risk of further renal failure, particularly if the patient's kidney function is compromised.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and intubated, which may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as pressure ulcers or seizures.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving antacid therapy, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or diarrhea.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue full vent support
* Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
* Aim to keep volume status even today
* TTE today to evaluate for LV dysfunction
* Consider rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain positive pressure
* Heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
* Full-dose ASA, Plavix
* Titrate Lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
* Diagnostic cath today, may require intervention
* IVF bolus, decrease sedation as tolerated if HoTN recurs
* Consider dopa vs. levophed for 1st line pressor if HoTN refractory to IVF
* Trend WBC, refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data available
* Follow up Cx data
* Monitor Cr
* Urine lytes pending"

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild mitral regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left lower lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to recurrent respiratory failure, acute pulmonary edema, and suspected demand ischemia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 100.6°F (38.1°C)
* Heart rate: 56 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 95/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Cardiac rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and has received vancomycin, cefepime, and midazolam infusions. She is currently receiving heparin, fentanyl, and famotidine.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 225 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.58 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.7 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows a new right lower lobe opacity, which is consistent with pneumonitis. Her sputum culture grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* Respiratory failure
* Suspected precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation
* Marked hypertension in the setting of respiratory distress likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate cardiac output against an elevated afterload
* Acute diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status
* Chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuation of full ventilator support
* Weaning of FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
* Continuation of vancomycin and cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage
* Aim to keep volume status even
* Diagnostic cardiac catheterization today, with potential for intervention
* Plan to transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain positive pressure
* Goal SBP 90, goal HR 65
* Titration of lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged ventilator support may be necessary to manage the patient's respiratory status.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization may reveal significant coronary artery disease, which may require intervention.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, which may indicate a pulmonary infection.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she may be at risk for hypotension, particularly if her cardiac output is compromised.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure that these potential complications are addressed promptly and effectively."

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w
   respiratory failure s/p ERCP, now with recurrent acute respiratory
   failure following trial of extubation.
   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation
 pt had similar event following ERCP.  Marked
   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
   -Aim to keep volume status even today
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   -[**Month (only) 60**] benefit from rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to
   maintain positive pressure
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS
   in the setting of presumed underlying CAD; no acute intervention
   warranted, will cont. medical therapy; goal SBP 90, goal HR 65
   -trend troponin to peak
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
   -full-dose ASA, plavix
   -titrate lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -TTE today to also eval. for WMA, stunned myocardium
   -cards aware of pt, will likely need elective cath when stable
   .
   #Hypotension
 fluid responsive; likely [**12-30**] sedation
   -IVF bolus, decr. sedation as tolerated if HoTN recurs
   -consider dopa vs. levophed for 1st line pressor if HoTN refractory to
   IVF
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Does not appear to be overwhelmingly infected although
   new RLL process invokes PNA vs. pneumonitis.  Also dirty U/A. Likely
   element of reactive leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC, refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data
   available
   -f/u Cx data
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable, but on systemic AC
   - follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - x-fuse to maintain Hct > 30%

   #ARF
 unclear b/l, has remained 1.3-1.4; may be element of ATN in the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild mitral regurgitation.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of lung cancer and is oxygen-dependent, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. The note suggests that the patient had an episode of respiratory failure following ERCP, and the current episode may be due to abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation.
2. Acute diastolic dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may lead to acute diastolic dysfunction, which can worsen respiratory status.
3. Demand ischemia: The patient has reversible ischemic changes on EKG, which may be due to demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has underlying CAD, and the ischemic changes may resolve with medical therapy.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they may be fluid-responsive. The note suggests that IVF bolus and deceleration of sedation may be necessary to manage hypotension.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the note suggests that this may be due to a reactive leukocytosis rather than an overwhelming infection. The patient's sputum culture is pending, and the note advises against treating the patient's symptoms until culture data is available.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but they are receiving systemic antibiotics, which may contribute to anemia.
7. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the note suggests that this may be due to pre-renal azotemia or ATN.
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient carries the diagnosis of COPD, but their history is unclear, and they have no documented PFTs.
9. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient has DM, and their glucose level is within normal limits.
10. Sedation: The patient is sedated, and the note advises against treating their symptoms without first weaning them off sedation.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are:

* Respiratory failure
* Acute diastolic dysfunction
* Demand ischemia
* Hypotension
* Leukocytosis
* Anemia
* Acute kidney injury (ARF)
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Diabetes mellitus (DM)
* Sedation

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuation of full vent support
* Weaning of FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
* Aim to keep volume status even
* TTE evaluation for LV dysfunction
* Trend troponin to peak
* Heparin drip, goal PTT 60-80
* Full-dose ASA, Plavix
* Titration of Lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
* TTE evaluation for WMA, stunned myocardium
* Cardiac awareness and potential elective catheterization when stable
* IVF bolus and deceleration of sedation for hypotension
* Trend WBC and refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data is available
* Follow-up with hospitalist and x-fusion to maintain Hct > 30%
* Monitor creatinine and urine lytes pending
* Outpatient PFTs for COPD
* RISS for DM
* Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, calc WNL"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She has a history of recent epigastric pain, which did not reveal a focal source in the biliary tree. She has developed recurrent respiratory failure with failing secondary to acute onset of pulmonary edema. The concern is for significant coronary artery obstruction driving injury and ischemia leading to increase in LVEDP driving recurrent pulmonary edema.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia and has been intubated for respiratory support. She has a preserved ejection fraction on trans-thoracic echo. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/43 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese patient with symmetric expansion and resonant percussion of the chest. She has rare and dependent crackles in the lung fields.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her troponin and CK-MB levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial infarction. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible acute kidney injury.

Radiology reports show an improved RLL infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is likely due to atelectasis or transient pneumonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin and CK-MB levels indicate possible myocardial infarction, which could lead to further complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and fever suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's recurrent pulmonary edema could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, hypoxia, and cardiac arrest.
5. Coronary artery obstruction: The patient's concern for significant coronary artery obstruction driving injury and ischemia could lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for possible nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as needed to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication as needed to prevent further kidney injury.
5. Plan for catheterization to evaluate for possible coronary artery obstruction.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust medication as needed to prevent further complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust diet as needed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with an increased need for oxygen and ventilation. The patient's lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make them prone to respiratory failure.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient's acute diastolic dysfunction, caused by tachycardia, has led to acute pulmonary edema, which can worsen their respiratory status.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, and their electrocardiogram (EKG) showed reversible ischemic changes, which may indicate underlying coronary artery disease (CAD).
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, but they are receiving systemic antibiotics, which can cause anemia.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels have improved, but they still have unclear bilateral kidney injury, which may be pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which may be due to their diabetes mellitus (DM) or stress response.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA in their sputum and GPC clusters in their blood culture, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
8. Sedation: The patient is receiving sedation, which may be necessary to manage their pain and anxiety, but it can also increase their risk of respiratory depression.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a net fluid intake of 1,272 mL over the past 24 hours, which may lead to fluid overload.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to their prolonged immobility and decreased mobility.

To address these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive full ventilatory support, and their FiO2 should be weaned to maintain a PO2 of 60 or higher. They should also receive ongoing antibiotic therapy for their suspected bacterial infection."

   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation, similar to the events subsequent to ERCP.
   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and
   worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV
   dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation
   on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w pneumonitis, does
   have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, now with recurrent
   respiratory failure [**12-30**] acute pulmonary edema following a second trial
   of extubation.
   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation, similar to the events subsequent to ERCP.
   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and
   worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV
   dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation
   on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w pneumonitis, does
   have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**]
   -Wean FiO2 to 40% (maintain PO2 >60), incr. RR to 18 to optimize

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a lobectomy and is now home oxygen-dependent. She has had recurrent respiratory failure, including acute pulmonary edema, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T max 38°C, T current 36.8°C, HR 60 bpm, BP 118/50 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 15 mmHg, PAOP not measured
* Respiratory support: Ventilator mode CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, Vt 550 mL, RR 16, PEEP 8 cmH2O, FiO2 50%
* Laboratory results: WBC 14.3 K/μL, Hct 33.1%, Plt 239 K/μL, Cr 1.4 mg/dL, TropT 0.58 ng/mL, TCO2 25 mmHg, Glucose 114 mg/dL
* Microbiology: Sputum - MRSA, Blood culture - coag-negative staph

The patient's diagnosis is respiratory failure, with a suspected precipitating event being the abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation. The patient has also been diagnosed with GPC bacteremia, demand ischemia, anemia, acute renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning FiO2 to 40% and increasing RR to 18 to optimize oxygenation and ventilation
* Turning off sedation and performing a pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial
* Increasing the dose of Lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 2-3 L
* Adding low-dose ACE inhibitor to improve afterload and diuresis
* Titrating nitroglycerin to a systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mmHg and lopressor to a heart rate of 60-65 bpm
* Considering rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain positive pressure
* Continuing vancomycin and considering changing the central line
* Implementing MRSA precautions
* Starting aspirin and statin therapy for demand ischemia
* Monitoring Cr levels while diuresing
* Following up with outpatient PFTs for COPD
* Managing glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Providing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart disease, who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema.
* The patient has undergone a diagnostic cardiac catheterization, which revealed normal coronary arteries, biventricular diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
* The patient's respiratory status has improved with continued ventilator support, and her oxygenation and ventilation are currently adequate.
* The patient has also been treated for suspected demand ischemia, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hyperglycemia, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* The patient's current medications include Lasix, Midazolam, Fentanyl, Famotidine, and antibiotics (Vanco and Cefepime).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, requiring further intervention such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying heart disease may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest, particularly in the setting of continued tachycardia and hypertension.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and ventilator support may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and continued bleeding risk may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of cardiac catheterization and potential intervention.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as delirium, cognitive impairment, or brain injury.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend continued close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status, as well as ongoing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w pneumonitis, does have coag +

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of lung cancer and has undergone a left lower lobe lobectomy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing recurrent respiratory failure in the setting of acute pulmonary edema.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
* Heart rate: 60 bpm (54-69 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/50 mmHg (71-155/94 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 15 mmHg (6-15 mmHg)

The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, famotidine, and vancomycin. She has also been receiving IV fluids and has had blood products transfused.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.3 K/uL (12.2-12.2 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL (8.3-9.9 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 239 K/uL (108-111 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (1.2-1.3 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.58 ng/mL (0.27-0.71 ng/mL)
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L

The patient's EKG shows reversible ischemic changes, which have resolved once the patient was no longer distressed, tachycardic, and hypertensive. The patient's TTE showed preserved biventricular function, but with increased PCWP and mild aortic stenosis.

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* Respiratory failure
* Demand ischemia
* Anemia
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Diabetes mellitus (DM)
* Sedation

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing full vent support
* Weaning FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
* Continuing vancomycin and cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage
* Maintaining volume status even
* Monitoring creatinine and electrolytes
* Considering a diagnostic cardiac catheterization
* Planning to transition to CPAP following extubation
* Monitoring for demand ischemia and adjusting therapy as needed
* Maintaining sedation with midazolam and fentanyl
* Monitoring for ARF and adjusting therapy as needed

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Worsening respiratory failure
* Demand ischemia
* ARF
* COPD exacerbation
* DM complications
* Sedation-related complications
* Cardiac complications (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure)

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

   RESP FAILURE
   -repeat xray today

   DISPO ISSUES:
   -pt to remain in the ICU
   I was physically present with the resident and fellow team for
   discussion of the patients course on this day and would agree with the
   note in full.  I would add
Patient with no evidence of stenosis of
   epicardial vessels based on cardiac catheterization.  She now has some
   persistent fevers in the setting of pulmonary infiltrate and CVL.  Her
   goals for successful extubation will likely depend on adequate
   stabilization of blood pressure and heart rate following extubation.
   For today
   -Will move to PSV wean today
   -Continue with diuresis
   -Will change CVL given fevers and concern for blood stream infection
   -Lisinopril for afterload reduction
   -Consider extubation on IV nitrate to control hemodynamics post

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old female with COPD, was admitted for an elective ERCP and intubated before the procedure. She has failed two extubations due to acute flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by ischemia with small vessel disease and stiff ventricles. The patient has a history of abdominal pain, and recent cardiac catheterization showed minimal large vessel disease.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation
* Fever, with a recent blood culture positive for MRSA
* Pulmonary infiltrate, with a possible blood stream infection
* Cardiovascular instability, with a murmur and possible systolic dysfunction
* Abdominal pain, with no evidence of stenosis of epicardial vessels

The patient's goals for successful extubation will depend on adequate stabilization of blood pressure and heart rate following extubation. The plan is to:

* Wean from mechanical ventilation to PSV
* Continue diuresis to manage fluid overload
* Change the central venous line (CVL) due to fevers and concern for blood stream infection
* Start lisinopril for afterload reduction
* Consider extubation on IV nitrate to control hemodynamics post-extubation
* Restart tube feeds and monitor glycemic control
* Review need for restraints and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia
* Cardiovascular instability, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock
* Blood stream infection, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Pulmonary infiltrate, leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure
* Abdominal pain, leading to bowel obstruction or perforation
* Cardiovascular disease, leading to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted for an elective ERCP procedure. He was intubated before the procedure and has failed two extubations likely due to acute flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation
* Hypoxia, with an SpO2 of 94%
* Hypercapnia, with an ABG pH of 7.37
* Tachypnea, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute
* Bradypnea, with a respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute during spontaneous breathing
* Fever, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Low-grade fevers
* Abdominal pain, likely related to the ERCP procedure
* MRSA positive in sputum and blood cultures
* BCX positive
* Low-grade anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL
* Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 239 K/uL
* Elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia

The patient's medical history is significant for COPD, and he has a history of penicillin allergy. He is currently receiving vancomycin and furosemide infusions, as well as famotidine and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished appearance
* No acute distress
* Overweight/obese
* No signs of respiratory distress
* Normal cardiovascular examination
* Abnormal abdominal examination, with soft, non-tender abdomen and present bowel sounds
* Normal neurologic examination, with patient sedated

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL
* Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 239 K/uL
* Elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia
* Elevated creatinine level, with a value of 1.4 mg/dL
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, with a value of 27 mg/dL
* Elevated lactate level, with a value of 0.7 mmol/L
* Elevated inflammatory markers, including CRP and ESR

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat chest X-ray today
* Continue to diurese aggressively
* Administer nitroglycerin patches peri-extubation
* Continue vancomycin and furosemide infusions
* Stop cefapime and change to vancomycin
* Repeat TTE and consider TEE due to murmur
* Follow up on MRSA susceptibility testing
* Restart tube feeds
* Continue statin and beta-blocker therapy
* Consider stopping ASA and Plavix
* Maintain full code status
* Continue ICU care, including DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury
* Cardiac ischemia
* Pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* DVT and PE
* VAP and other ventilator-associated complications

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, abdominal pain, and admitted for an elective ERCP procedure. He was intubated before the procedure and has failed two extubations due to acute flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by ischemia with small vessel disease and stiff ventricles, as well as anxiety peri-extubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: Sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 143/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 65 bpm.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP of 15 mmHg, with a total fluid balance of 42 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Renal function: Creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, with a BUN of 27 mg/dL.
* Liver function: AST of 56 IU/L, with an ALT of 31 IU/L.
* Electrolytes: Sodium of 146 mmol/L, potassium of 4.1 mmol/L, and chloride of 27 mmol/L.
* Blood glucose: 114 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, for which he is receiving vancomycin. He also has a history of CAD, for which he is taking a statin and beta blocker.

The patient's current plan includes:

* Repeat x-ray today to assess for any changes in lung consolidation.
* Continue to diurese aggressively to manage fluid overload.
* Start nitroglycerin to manage blood pressure.
* Continue vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.
* Stop cefapime due to low levels.
* Change TLC to a different antibiotic.
* Repeat TTE to assess for any changes in cardiac function.
* Consider TEE to further evaluate cardiac function.
* Follow up on blood cultures and tip for culture.
* Continue statin and beta blocker for CAD.

The patient's disposition is critical, and he will need to remain in the ICU for further management."

   respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, now with recurrent
   respiratory failure [**12-30**] acute pulmonary edema following a second trial
   of extubation.
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation, similar to the events subsequent to ERCP.
   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and
   worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV
   dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation
   on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w pneumonitis, does
   have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who underwent ERCP and developed acute respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema. She has a history of lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent. After two trials of extubation, she developed recurrent respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema. The patient has several comorbidities, including chronic lung disease, hypertension, and diabetes.

The patient is currently ventilated on a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/53 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 inspirations per minute, and her SpO2 is 94%. She has a central venous catheter in place and is receiving multiple medications, including furosemide, famotidine, midazolam, and fentanyl.

The patient has several laboratory values that are abnormal, including a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, and a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is elevated at 0.34 ng/mL, and her lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L. She has a history of bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus and S. aureus in her sputum.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may continue to worsen due to her chronic lung disease and the presence of pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of demand ischemia and bivent diastolic dysfunction may lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia may lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes and chronic lung disease may lead to metabolic complications, including hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress to a more severe form, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's central venous catheter and immobility may increase her risk of developing a venous thromboembolism.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's acute respiratory failure and cardiac complications require ongoing management in the ICU. The patient's antibiotics should be continued, and her ventilator settings should be adjusted as needed to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's cardiac medications, including aspirin and statin, should be continued to manage her demand ischemia and bivent diastolic dysfunction. The patient's anemia should be monitored, and her hemoglobin level should be maintained above 30%. The patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored, and her potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels should be maintained within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose level should be monitored, and her diabetes should be managed with insulin therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal

   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and
   worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV
   dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing recurrent respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition. The precipitating event was likely the abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation, leading to acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
2. Acute Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia due to hypertension may have caused acute diastolic dysfunction, leading to further worsening of respiratory status.
3. Chronic LV Dysfunction: The patient's oxygen requirement at both levels suggests chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but it is unclear whether it is due to chronic disease or acute blood loss.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's Cr levels are unclear, but it is suspected that it may be due to pre-renal azotemia or ATN in the setting of hypertension.
6. Demand Ischemia: The patient's demand ischemia is likely due to bivent diastolic dysfunction on cath, which may be caused by distal, small-vessel disease.
7. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has a suspected GPC bacteremia, which may be due to contamination.
8. Sedation-Related Complications: The patient is currently sedated with fentanyl and versed, which may lead to respiratory depression and other complications.
9. Volume Overload: The patient has a volume goal of 3-4L negative, which may be challenging to achieve, especially with the patient's respiratory status.
10. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are unstable, with a risk of developing hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.

In terms of the patient's overall condition, they are critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation, similar to the events subsequent to ERCP.
   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and
   worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV
   dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation
   on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w pneumonitis, does

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is a 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure following ERCP and flash pulmonary edema.
* The patient has a history of lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent.
* The patient had a trial of extubation, but developed recurrent respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema.
* The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
* The patient has been receiving various medications, including furosemide, famotidine, midazolam, and fentanyl.
* The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL.
* The patient's imaging studies show pulmonary effusions and improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR.
* The patient's diagnosis includes respiratory failure, demand ischemia, anemia, acute kidney injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus.
* The patient's plan includes weaning off sedation, increasing the respiratory rate to 18 breaths per minute, and titrating medications to optimize hemodynamics and oxygenation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if the patient's oxygenation and ventilation are not optimized.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's demand ischemia and acute diastolic dysfunction can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
* Kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury can worsen if the patient's blood pressure is not controlled and if the patient is not adequately hydrated.
* Infection: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly treated.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or diarrhea.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutritional status can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients and electrolytes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, respiratory failure (recurrent pulmonary edema)
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Good progress on ventilator.  Failed extubation
   x2 --> attributed to flash pulmonary edema.  Plan to continue net
   diuresis (and possible afterload reduction).  Work towards SBT and
   extubation trial following adequate diuresis and BP control.
   HYPERTENSION -- underlying medical condition, exacerbated by anxiety
   (intubation), and contributing to develpment of pulmonary edema.
   [**Hospital 3795**] medical management.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to diastolic dysfunction (hypertension).
   Control hypertension, afterload reduction, net diuresis.
   BACTEREMIA -- staph coag negative; likely line-related infection.
   Central line resighted.  Continue antimicrobials.
   AGGITATION -- add propofol to Fentanyl
   SEPSIS -- s/p ERCP.  Good response to current regimen.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   h/o lung CA -- s/p LLL lung resection, remote.  Loss of lung parenchyma
   possibly contributing to inability to successfully extubate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, and pulmonary edema. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a history of recurrent pulmonary edema and failed extubation attempts.

The patient has a central line infection, which is being treated with antimicrobials. They are also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for sepsis. The patient's hypertension is being managed with medical treatment, and they are experiencing marked swings in level of consciousness, accompanied by hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with a respiratory support plan in place. They are receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, and their glycemic control is being managed with a regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient has a history of lung cancer, with a remote lung resection, which may be contributing to their inability to successfully extubate.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, and it can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's recurrent pulmonary edema can lead to further respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and diastolic dysfunction can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
5. Line-related complications: The patient's central line infection can lead to further complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, and endocarditis.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to tolerate oral nutrition can lead to malnutrition and related complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and sedation can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, ileus, and stress ulceration.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She had a history of lung cancer and was home oxygen-dependent. She experienced recurrent respiratory failure, including acute pulmonary edema, following a second trial of extubation. The patient's current condition is stable, with adequate oxygenation and ventilation on current settings. However, she requires continued management to optimize her respiratory and hemodynamic status.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** The patient's history of recurrent respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema increases her risk of developing ARDS.
2. **Pneumonitis:** The patient's chest X-ray shows improved RLL opacity, which may indicate pneumonitis, potentially caused by the bacteria isolated from her sputum.
3. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's serum creatinine levels are stable, but her UNa levels are 15, suggesting pre-renal azotemia. This may be an indication of AKI.
4. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's history of coronary artery disease and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension increases her risk of cardiac complications, including demand ischemia and heart failure.
5. **Septic Shock:** The patient's history of bacteremia and her current respiratory failure increase her risk of developing septic shock.
6. **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP):** The patient's prolonged ventilation and use of antibiotics increase her risk of developing VAP.
7. **Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI):** The patient's use of urinary catheters increases her risk of developing CAUTI.
8. **Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI):** The patient's central line placement increases her risk of developing CLABSI.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Optimize her oxygenation and ventilation settings.
3. Monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
4. Consider increasing her lisinopril dose to 20mg based on her blood pressure.
5. Continue to monitor her cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider switching to a different antibiotic regimen to treat her bacteremia.
7. Monitor her for signs of sepsis and septic shock.
8. Consider performing a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from the ventilator."

   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w
   respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, now with recurrent
   respiratory failure [**12-30**] acute pulmonary edema following a second trial
   of extubation.
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation, similar to the events subsequent to ERCP.
   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and
   worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV
   dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation
   on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w pneumonitis, does
   have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**]
   -Wean FiO2 to 40% (maintain PO2 >60), incr. RR to 18 to optimize
   oxygenation/ventilation respectively
   - Switch sedation from versed/fentanyl to propofol
   -cont Lasix gtt to achieve 3-4 L negative today to optimize extubation
   tomorrow; follow electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue low-dose ACEi to improve afterload, diuresis; will consider
   increasing lisinopril from 10mg to 20mg based on blood pressure after
   the sedation is switched to propofol.
   -Will start nitroprusside gtt titrated to SBP 90-100 and lopressor
   titrated to HR 60-65 to optimize hemodynamics peri-extubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure following extubation after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. She had a previous history of lung lobectomy and was home oxygen-dependent. The patient had recurrent respiratory failure, including acute pulmonary edema, and was treated with diuretics, vasopressors, and oxygen therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 170/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 320 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show normal electrolyte levels, with a slight elevation in creatinine (1.3 mg/dL) and a mild increase in lactate (0.6 mmol/L). Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 12.2 x 10^9/L and a platelet count of 248 x 10^9/L.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. She is also taking medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including tiotropium and fluticasone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still at risk for further respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and the potential for further exacerbations.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infections, particularly given her immunosuppressed state.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further kidney injury due to her underlying chronic kidney disease and the potential for further nephrotoxic medications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and is at risk for further cardiac complications, particularly given her underlying chronic kidney disease and the potential for further nephrotoxic medications.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia and is at risk for further sepsis due to her underlying immunosuppressed state and the potential for further infections.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current plan is to continue diuretic therapy to achieve a negative fluid balance, and to optimize her oxygenation and ventilation. She will also continue to receive vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure. The patient's sedation will be switched to propofol to maintain comfort, and she will continue to receive anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis. The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored, and she will receive further treatment as necessary to manage her underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP. She has a history of lung cancer and was home oxygen-dependent.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with unprovoked episodes of respiratory distress on the ventilator, requiring increases in PEEP to 10 cmH2O to resolve. She has also had episodes of hypotension, including one episode with a CVP of 0 mmHg, which responded to a 500cc bolus. The patient's electrolytes are being closely monitored, and she is receiving diuretics to achieve a negative fluid balance.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with acute diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension noted on cardiac catheterization. She is receiving medications to manage her blood pressure and heart rate, including propofol, fentanyl, and lopressor.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin-T, suggesting possible cardiac or pulmonary damage. Her kidney function is stable, but her urine output is decreased, and she is at risk for acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may continue to experience episodes of respiratory distress, which can lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is concerning, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest possible infection, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows improved RLL opacity, which may indicate pneumonitis, and her sputum culture is positive for coag-neg staph, which may indicate pneumonia.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase her risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, or retroperitoneal bleeding.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and kidney status. She should also receive antibiotics to manage her suspected infection and receive anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombotic events."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal

   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure after undergoing ERCP and extubation. She has a history of lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent. The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory distress, including an unprovoked episode on the ventilator yesterday that resolved with an increase in PEEP to 10. She has also had episodes of hypotension, including one episode with a CVP of zero after diuresis with lasix. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 170/87 mmHg. She is sedated and has continuous leg movement. Her lungs are clear, and she has no wheezing or rhonchi. The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 12.2, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to acute pulmonary edema, which can be caused by tachycardia, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's oxygen requirement is high, which may indicate chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD.
2. Acute Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's acute diastolic dysfunction may be caused by tachycardia and hypertension, which can lead to acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Chronic LV Dysfunction: The patient's chronic LV dysfunction may be contributing to her respiratory failure and high oxygen requirement.
4. Subclinical CAD: The patient's subclinical CAD may be contributing to her respiratory failure and high oxygen requirement.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to her fatigue and shortness of breath.
6. ARF: The patient's ARF may be caused by pre-renal azotemia, which can be caused by hypovolemia and hypertension.
7. COPD: The patient's COPD may be contributing to her respiratory failure and high oxygen requirement.
8. DM: The patient's DM may be contributing to her hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

Plan:

1. Continue sedation with propofol to maintain patient comfort and reduce stress.
2. Continue diuresis with lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 3-4 L today.
3. Monitor electrolytes and replete as necessary to keep K>4, Mg>2, and Ca++ WNL.
4. Continue low-dose ACEi to improve afterload and diuresis.
5. Consider increasing lisinopril from 10mg to 20mg based on blood pressure.
6. Start nitroprusside gtt titrated to SBP 90-100 and lopressor titrated to HR 60-65 to optimize hemodynamics peri-extubation.
7. Continue vancomycin for 5-12 days and monitor for GPC bacteremia.
8. Continue heparin gtt for 48 hours and then stop.
9. Monitor Cr and UNa levels to assess for pre-renal azotemia and ATN.
10. Consider outpatient PFTs to assess for COPD and chronic LV dysfunction.
11. Continue atrovent and albuterol MDI for COPD management.
12. Monitor patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, with underlying COPD and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has been stable, with a good clinical response to furosemide (Lasix) and propofol.

The patient experienced hypotension last night, which was resolved with an IV fluid bolus. The patient has been tolerating propofol and remains on lasix drip. Intermittent agitation has been noted.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 12.2 x 10^9/L, and platelet count is 248 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 31 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 56 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with underlying COPD and pulmonary edema. The patient will be worked up for another spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial if able to remove intravascular volume.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is net volume overloaded, and will continue to receive net diuresis to dry weight.
3. Restless legs syndrome: The patient will resume pharmacological treatment for restless legs syndrome.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure will be optimized with nitroglycerin or nipride.
5. Renal function: The patient's renal function is preserved, and will be monitored for urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine.
6. Nutritional support: The patient will receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with a caloric goal of 40 mL/hour.
7. ICU care: The patient will continue to receive ICU care, with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload can lead to worsening of respiratory failure, hypertension, and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Restless legs syndrome: The patient's restless legs syndrome can worsen if not managed properly, leading to discomfort, pain, and sleep disturbances.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac dysfunction, stroke, and renal damage.
5. Renal function: The patient's renal function can worsen if not monitored properly, leading to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional deficiencies can worsen if not managed properly, leading to malnutrition, weakness, and impaired wound healing.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal functions to prevent complications and improve their outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of their current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by advanced COPD and pulmonary edema.
* They are experiencing hypotension, which was resolved with an IV fluid bolus.
* The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and is currently receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention.
* They have a net fluid balance of -5000 mL, indicating fluid overload.
* The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 483 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory complications:
	+ Failure to wean off mechanical ventilation due to underlying COPD and pulmonary edema.
	+ Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
* Cardiovascular complications:
	+ Hypotension, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
	+ Risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or underlying cardiac disease.
* Renal complications:
	+ Risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to fluid overload and potential nephrotoxic medications.
	+ Monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine is essential to detect early signs of AKI.
* Nutritional complications:
	+ Risk of malnutrition due to prolonged stay in the ICU and limited oral intake.
	+ Monitoring of nutritional status and provision of adequate caloric intake is crucial to prevent malnutrition.
* Infection complications:
	+ Risk of sepsis due to prolonged intubation and potential bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract.
	+ Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical signs of infection is essential to detect early signs of sepsis.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Optimize fluid management to prevent further fluid overload and maintain adequate perfusion.
* Consider tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed to prevent AKI.
* Provide adequate nutritional support to prevent malnutrition.
* Monitor the patient's infection status and adjust antibiotics as needed to prevent sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.

   In person discussion and telephone conversation with daughters (HCP).
   Clearly state that patient would NOT want to proceed to tracheotomy
   tube (patient indicated this clearly in prior discussions with family
   members).  Severe underlying COPD.  Plans will continue as outlined,
   with hope for optimizing medical status to allow safe extubation
   trial.  However, if despite optimized medical condition and extubation,
   in the event of recurrent respiratory distress, NO reintubation would
   be desired, and NO tracheotomy tube.  Answered all questions.  Will
   proceed as outlined in above notes.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a history of respiratory failure due to COPD and pulmonary edema. The risk of further respiratory compromise is high, especially if the patient's underlying COPD is not well-managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension last night, which was resolved with IV fluid bolus. This highlights the need for careful fluid management to avoid volume overload and hypotension.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has a net fluid balance of -5000 mL, indicating that they are still volume overloaded. This can lead to further respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and the plan is to optimize BP control with medications such as nitroglycerin or nipride. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to further cardiovascular complications.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are within normal limits, but their BUN levels are slightly elevated. This suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI).
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving tube feeds, but their nutritional status is not well-documented. They may be at risk for malnutrition, which can further complicate their respiratory and cardiovascular status.
7. Restless legs syndrome: The patient is experiencing restless legs syndrome, which can be uncomfortable and affect their sleep quality. This may impact their overall well-being and ability to tolerate medical interventions.
8. Tracheostomy: The patient's family has discussed the possibility of a tracheostomy, but the patient has explicitly stated that they do not want to proceed with this intervention. This highlights the importance of respecting the patient's autonomy and preferences.
9. Code status: The patient has a full code status, which means that all life-sustaining interventions will be pursued if the patient's condition deteriorates. This may be a concern for the patient and their family, especially if the patient's underlying condition is severe and irreversible.

Overall, the patient is at risk for further respiratory and cardiovascular complications due to their underlying COPD and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and careful management of their fluid status, blood pressure, and nutritional needs are crucial to preventing further complications and improving their overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall, 117.8 kg (admission weight: 109.1 kg) individual with a history of respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, tolerating propofol sedation.

The patient experienced hypotension last evening, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 0 mmHg and a net fluid balance of -5000 mL, which was resolved with an intravenous fluid bolus. The patient has been intermittently agitated.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.2-13.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 28.2-30.1%
* Platelet count (Plt): 11.8-12.2 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2-1.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 93-152 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.27 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F) to 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 67 bpm (55-84 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/50 mmHg (71-171/33-119 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (12-26 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress, overweight/obese
* Eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light)
* Head, ears, nose, throat: Normocephalic, no poor dentition, endotracheal tube
* Lymphatic: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse, no murmurs
* Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left radial and digital pulses present
* Neurologic: Sedated, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to self and surroundings

The patient's plan includes:

* Respiratory failure management: continue mechanical ventilation, hope to work towards another spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial if able to remove intravascular volume
* Fluid management: continue net diuresis to dry weight
* Restless legs syndrome: resume pharmacological treatment
* Hypertension: optimize blood pressure control
* Renal function: monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine
* Nutritional support: total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* ICU care: continue regular insulin sliding scale, arterial line, multi-lumen line, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Renal failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pressure ulcers
* Delirium
* Wound infections

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now with recurrent resp
   failure [**12-30**] acute pulm edema following a second trial of extubation.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w
   pneumonitis; does have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**].
   -          Propofol was weaned off overnight due to hypotension but
   restarted at half the previous rate due to agitation.
   -          Will monitor BP as pt is more awake and aim for afterload
   reduction with captopril.
   -          Attempt extubation today with family at bedside; will
   consider rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain
   positive pressure. Will check with family for confirmation of their
   wishes as pt

s outpt pulmonologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3813**]:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3814**]. Pt has a long standing diagnosis of COPD with
   additional features of asthma. Last PFTs done in [**8-5**]; FEV1 2.1 (81%
   expected), EFV1/FVC (56% expected). Pt
s O2 requirement has been out of
   proportion to objective data of PFTs. Pt became chronically O2
   dependent after LUL lobectomy in [**8-4**], and is on 2L of oxygen at home.
   Pt also takes Advair 250 [**Hospital1 **], spiriva, and alb PRN. Pt was last seen by
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3813**] in [**12-5**], and was stable at that time respiratory wise.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: resp failure
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt became hypotensive to SBP 80s overnight, was given boluses 750 cc x
   1, lasix gtt was d/c'd, propofol titrated off, and captopril was
   decreased. Pt initially was non fluid responsive, noted to have marked
   decrease in u/o in the setting of hypotension. Subsequently pt was
   bloused another 500ccs with appropriate increase in u/o and BP.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP. She has a history of lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and she is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has developed acute pulmonary edema, likely due to tachycardia and hypertension following extubation. She also has bacteremia with MRSA and GPC, and has a demand ischemia diagnosis with biventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may continue to experience respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with MRSA and GPC, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, and her creatinine levels are elevated. She may continue to experience kidney injury if not properly managed.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has demand ischemia with biventricular diastolic dysfunction, which increases her risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of sepsis.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases her risk of developing VAP.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a central line and is at risk of developing DVT.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a risk of developing stress ulcer.
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, which may not be adequate to meet her nutritional needs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall, 117.8 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been monitored closely, and several interventions have been made to manage his hypotension and fluid status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, and blood pressure of 85/31 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his SpO2 is 96%. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's fluid status has been managed with boluses of 750 cc and 500 cc, which resulted in an increase in his urine output and blood pressure. His central venous pressure (CVP) has increased from 3 to 10 mmHg with fluid administration.

The patient's laboratory results show normal kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. His liver function tests are also within normal limits, with an albumin level of 3.2 g/dL. His electrolyte levels are normal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and a calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes propofol, famotidine, and heparin sodium. He has a history of penicillin allergy and has received vancomycin in the past.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and hypotension make him susceptible to sepsis, particularly given his recent antibiotic exposure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels suggest that he may be at risk for AKI.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiac compromise, which could worsen his respiratory failure.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory failure and ventilator dependence make him susceptible to pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels suggest that he may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli suggest that he may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures and brain edema.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. Further interventions may be necessary to address his hypotension, fluid status, and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: resp failure
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt became hypotensive to SBP 80s overnight, was given boluses 750 cc x
   1, lasix gtt was d/c'd, propofol titrated off, and captopril was
   decreased. Pt initially was non fluid responsive, noted to have marked
   decrease in u/o in the setting of hypotension. Subsequently pt was
   bloused another 500ccs with appropriate increase in u/o and BP.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy and was home oxygen-dependent. She developed respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP and has since had recurrent respiratory failure, including acute pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 53 bpm, blood pressure 85/31 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: central venous pressure 10 mmHg, mean arterial pressure 85 mmHg, and cardiac output 9.4 L/min.
* Fluid balance: the patient has received a total of 2,909 mL of fluids, with a total output of 4,760 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,851 mL.
* Respiratory support: the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 483 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results: the patient's white blood cell count is 13.4 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count is 268 K/uL. Her creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL, and her lactate level is 0.6 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury: the patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her fluid balance is negative, which may indicate a risk of acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiovascular instability: the patient's blood pressure is labile, and her heart rate is elevated, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
4. Infection: the patient has coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum, which may indicate a risk of infection.
5. Pneumonia: the patient has improved RLL opacity on CXR, which may indicate pneumonia.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient has a history of bleeding, and her coagulation parameters are abnormal, which may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, CHF, and hypotension. They have been in the ICU for several days and have received various treatments, including fluid boluses, sedation reduction, and medication adjustments. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and their vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies have been reviewed. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a reduction in RSBI, but they remain critically ill and require ongoing intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and they are at risk of developing further respiratory failure, particularly if they fail extubation or experience a decline in oxygenation.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's NSTEMI and CHF make them susceptible to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and antibiotic therapy make them at risk for developing antibiotic-resistant infections or secondary infections.
4. Metabolic Imbalance: The patient's metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia require close monitoring and correction to prevent further complications.
5. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and invasive procedures make them at risk for bleeding complications.
6. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's critical illness may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or sepsis.
7. Sedation Withdrawal: The patient's prolonged sedation may lead to withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, anxiety, or delirium.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and critical illness may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or brain death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely.
2. Adjust medication regimens as needed to optimize the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status.
3. Implement stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis measures.
4. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a cardiologist or pulmonologist, to optimize the patient's care.
5. Develop a plan for weaning the patient off sedation and extubation, taking into account their family's wishes and the patient's current condition.
6. Continue to educate the patient's family on their condition, treatment plan, and potential complications."

   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT

   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, COPD, home
   O2-dependent, initially intubated electively for ERCP, s/p failed
   extubation x 2 due to flash pulm edema
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT
   difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG: 7.46/48/85/8; RR
   [**Month (only) 38**]
d to 14, repeat ABG 7.44/50/78/7, RR was once again decreased to
   12.
   Talked to pt
s outpt pulmonologist, who stated that pt has had a long
   standing COPD, although her oxygen requirement has been out of
   proportion to her disease severity. FEV1/FVC 50-60% of expected. Pt has
   required home O2 of 2L since her LUL lobectomy in [**8-4**]. COPD had been
   stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, left upper lobe lobectomy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for elective ERCP and developed respiratory failure following extubation due to laryngeal edema. She has been intubated and ventilated for several days.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and ventilated with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/41 mmHg, and a sinus rhythm.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, and her fluid balance is 954 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.3, hemoglobin is 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count is 268 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to laryngeal edema, and she requires ongoing ventilatory support.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may have pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she may require transfusion.
* Ischemia: The patient has a history of demand ischemia, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and her platelet count is low.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and her white blood cell count is elevated.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Ongoing ventilatory support
* Monitoring of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and hemodynamic status
* Management of her electrolyte imbalances
* Treatment of her acute kidney injury
* Monitoring of her anemia and bleeding risk
* Consideration of tracheostomy placement
* Consultation with interventional pulmonology for tracheostomy placement
* Consultation with general surgery for evaluation and potential surgery to place a tracheostomy"

   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with family the plan for extubation,
   and pt was extubated. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted. Racemic epi and Heliox given without effect. O2
   sat dropped to 88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for
   re-intubation, who noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple events occurring over the past 24 hours. The patient was sensitive to propofol, which led to a drop in blood pressure. They were extubated, but developed stridor and increased work of breathing, requiring re-intubation. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has required home oxygen therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating potential inflammation and organ dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, and chloride, are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and recent extubation may lead to respiratory failure, which could require further mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's sensitive response to propofol and blood pressure fluctuations may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased mortality.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of stress ulcer prophylaxis and elevated lactate levels may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory events may lead to neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, or even brain death.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall male, weighing 102.9 kg, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS. He was initially on CPAP 40% 10/8 and later weaned to [**4-2**] with ABGs within normal limits. He was sedated with propofol, which was weaned off, and beta blockers were held due to sensitivity. The patient became increasingly more alert and followed commands, nodding appropriately with family at the bedside. He was started on Lasix to maximize fluid balance and was planned for extubation later in the evening.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored, and he is on mechanical ventilation with [**4-2**]. He is at risk for respiratory failure, especially if the ventilator settings are not adjusted properly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is sensitive to propofol, and he is at risk for hypotension if the medication is not weaned off properly.
3. Hypercarbia: The patient's ABGs show hypercarbia (50-60s), which may lead to respiratory acidosis and other complications if not addressed.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is closely monitored, and he is at risk for fluid overload or dehydration if the Lasix infusion is not adjusted properly.
5. Sedation withdrawal: The patient was sedated with propofol, which was weaned off. He may experience sedation withdrawal symptoms, such as agitation, anxiety, or insomnia, which need to be managed.
6. Delirium: The patient's mental status is closely monitored, and he is at risk for delirium, especially with the weaning of sedation.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamics are closely monitored, and he is at risk for hemodynamic instability if the beta blockers are not held or if the Lasix infusion is not adjusted properly.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, especially with the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of central lines.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is closely monitored, and he is at risk for nutritional deficiencies if not adequately managed.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is closely monitored, and he is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, especially with the use of anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now with recurrent resp
   failure [**12-30**] acute pulm edema following a second trial of extubation.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w
   pneumonitis; does have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**].
   -          Propofol was weaned off overnight due to hypotension but
   restarted at half the previous rate due to agitation.
   -          Will monitor BP as pt is more awake and aim for afterload
   reduction with captopril.
   -          Attempt extubation today with family at bedside; will
   consider rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain
   positive pressure. Will check with family for confirmation of their
   wishes as pt
s HCP
   -          Continue nitroprusside drip titrated to SBP 90-100 and
   lopressor titrated to HR 60-65 (as tolerated by BP) to optimize
   hemodynamics peri-extubation
   -          Goal I/O even today as pt appears euvolemic to dry today
   clinically; also labs showing high normal Na and high BUN: Cr ratio
   indicating dehydration.
   # GPC bacteremia (1/2 bottles, likely contamination), MRSA + in sputum
   (may be ventilator associated PNA)
   -          Continue Vanco (day [**6-11**]); cefepime was d/c

   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours
   -          Continue ASA 81, statin
   -          Titrate Lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -          Continue Captopril with parameters
   # Anemia, hct stable.

   # COPD
 discussed with pt
s outpt pulmonologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3813**]:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3814**]. Pt has a long standing diagnosis of COPD with
   additional features of asthma. Last PFTs done in [**8-5**]; FEV1 2.1 (81%
   expected), EFV1/FVC (56% expected). Pt
s O2 requirement has been out of
   proportion to objective data of PFTs. Pt became chronically O2
   dependent after LUL lobectomy in [**8-4**], and is on 2L of oxygen at home.
   Pt also takes Advair 250 [**Hospital1 **], spiriva, and alb PRN. Pt was last seen by
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3813**] in [**12-5**], and was stable at that time respiratory wise.
   -          atrovent/albuterol MDI
   -          outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # Mental status: difficult to assess. Occasionally follows commands.
   -          Versed was d/c

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy for lung cancer and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was intubated electively for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure but developed flash pulmonary edema after extubation, leading to recurrent respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema. She has been reintubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 113/41 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are 7.44/50/77/32.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a differential of 78.3% neutrophils, 15.6% lymphocytes, and 4.7% monocytes. Her hemoglobin level is 10.2 g/dL, and her platelet count is 268,000/μL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history is significant for COPD, lung cancer, and chronic liver disease. She has a history of chronic oxygen dependence and is currently on 2L of oxygen at home.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema may lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may indicate the presence of pneumonia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and low urine output may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of chronic liver disease and lung cancer may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture for Gram-positive bacteria may indicate the presence of a bloodstream infection.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive blood culture may indicate the presence of sepsis.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of chronic liver disease and lung cancer may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of chronic oxygen dependence and lung cancer may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema are likely related to her chronic lung disease and chronic oxygen dependence. The patient's history of chronic liver disease and lung cancer may increase her risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications. The patient's positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of a bloodstream infection or sepsis.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, antibiotics for her positive blood culture, and supportive care for her respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's oxygen requirement will be reassessed, and she will be weaned off mechanical ventilation as her respiratory status improves. The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored, and she will receive IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation as needed. The patient's cardiovascular and gastrointestinal status will be closely monitored, and she will receive treatment for any complications that arise."

   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with family the plan for extubation,
   and pt was extubated. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted. Racemic epi and Heliox given without effect. O2
   sat dropped to 88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for
   re-intubation, who noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing
   of 6.5 tube difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG:

s outpt pulmonologist, who stated that pt has had a long
   standing COPD, although her oxygen requirement has been out of
   proportion to her disease severity. FEV1/FVC 50-60% of expected. Pt has
   required home O2 of 2L since her LUL lobectomy in [**8-4**]. COPD had been

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, COPD, home
   O2-dependent, initially intubated electively for ERCP, s/p failed
   extubation x 2 due to flash pulm edema due to  following extubation
   after ERCP, now with recurrent resp failure [**12-30**] acute pulm edema
   following a second trial of extubation
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with family the plan for extubation,
   and pt was extubated. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted. Racemic epi and Heliox given without effect. O2
   sat dropped to 88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for
   re-intubation, who noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing
   of 6.5 tube difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG:

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3^rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w
   pneumonitis; does have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**].
   -          Propofol was weaned off overnight due to hypotension but
   restarted at half the previous rate due to agitation.
   -          Will monitor BP as pt is more awake and aim for afterload
   reduction with captopril.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, and home oxygen-dependent. She was admitted for elective ERCP and developed recurrent respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema following extubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Failed extubation for the third time due to laryngeal edema. She has acute pulmonary edema, and her oxygen requirement is high. She is on ventilator support with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: She has hypertension, tachycardia, and acute diastolic dysfunction. She has a history of chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD.
* Renal: She has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.2-1.3 mg/dL. Her UNa is 15, suggesting pre-renal azotemia, but may also be an element of ATN in the setting of hypotension.
* Hematological: She has anemia with a hematocrit level of 27.8%. She is receiving blood transfusions as needed.
* Neurological: Her mental status is difficult to assess due to sedation. She occasionally follows commands.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued ventilator support to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension, tachycardia, and acute diastolic dysfunction may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential kidney damage.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of GPC bacteremia and MRSA-positive sputum, which may lead to sepsis or septic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and potential neurological instability may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or altered mental status.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as bleeding or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue ventilator support with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5 cmH2O.
* Monitor blood pressure and aim for afterload reduction with captopril.
* Attempt extubation today with family at bedside and consider rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain positive pressure.
* Continue nitroprusside drip titrated to SBP 90-100 and lopressor titrated to HR 60-65 to optimize hemodynamics peri-extubation.
* Monitor creatinine level and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
* Continue antibiotic therapy for GPC bacteremia and MRSA-positive sputum.
* Monitor hemoglobin level and transfuse if necessary.
* Continue sedation with propofol to assess alertness.
* Hold propofol if hypotensive.
* Continue tube feeds and hold for pending extubation.
* Replete electrolytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, and Ca WNL.
* Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or changes in respiratory status.
* Consider adjusting antibiotic therapy based on culture results."

   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, COPD, home
   O2-dependent, initially intubated electively for ERCP, s/p failed
   extubation x 2 due to flash pulm edema
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT
   difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG: 7.46/48/85/8; RR
   [**Month (only) 38**]
d to 14, repeat ABG 7.44/50/78/7, RR was once again decreased to
   12.
   Talked to pt
s outpt pulmonologist, who stated that pt has had a long
   standing COPD, although her oxygen requirement has been out of
   proportion to her disease severity. FEV1/FVC 50-60% of expected. Pt has
   required home O2 of 2L since her LUL lobectomy in [**8-4**]. COPD had been
   stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and home oxygen-dependent. She was initially intubated electively for ERCP but failed extubation twice due to flash pulmonary edema. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 113/41 mmHg to 191/88 mmHg, heart rate between 52-96 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory rate is slightly elevated, but her ABG results show a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 50 mmHg, and pO2 of 77 mmHg.

The patient has a history of allergic reactions to penicillins and has required home oxygen therapy since her lobectomy. She has also had a recent episode of bacteremia, which was likely caused by contamination, and has been treated with vancomycin. Her blood cultures are pending, and she is being monitored for signs of infection.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.3 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 268 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 32 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She is currently receiving treatment for demand ischemia, anemia, and acute renal failure. She is also being monitored for signs of infection and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and flash pulmonary edema puts her at risk for respiratory failure. She may require further respiratory support, such as non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy.
2. Infection: The patient's recent episode of bacteremia and her history of COPD put her at risk for further infections. She should be monitored closely for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum production.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a history of chronic kidney disease. She may require further monitoring and treatment for acute kidney injury.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly elevated, and she may require further monitoring and treatment for anemia.
5. Demand ischemia: The patient's history of demand ischemia puts her at risk for further cardiac events. She should be monitored closely for signs of cardiac distress, such as chest pain or shortness of breath.
6. Laryngeal edema: The patient's history of laryngeal edema puts her at risk for further respiratory distress. She should be monitored closely for signs of laryngeal edema, such as stridor or hoarseness.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and treatment for her respiratory failure, infection, acute kidney injury, anemia, demand ischemia, and laryngeal edema."

   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3^rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3^rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.
   -          Although unlikely, ACEI could be contributing to laryngeal
   edema
 will D/C
   -          Pt seen by interventional pulmonology for trach placement;
   due to scarring from previous trach, pt will need surgery to place
   trach. General surgery to evaluation pt. Will plan for trach placement
   today or tomorrow, and hold tube feeds for now.
   -          Goal I/O even today and pt appears euvolemic clinically.

   -          Completed a 7-day course of Vancomycine yesterday; will
   discontinue further vanco therapy as RLL infiltrate improved
   radiologically and pt is afebrile. Will re-assess for clinical s/s of
   infxn, ie. Increased sputum production, fever, worsening leukocytosis.
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours
   -          Continue ASA 81, statin
   -          Titrate Lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -          D/C captopril as it may cause laryngeal edema in this pt
   # Anemia, hct stable.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, and home oxygen-dependent. She was initially intubated electively for ERCP, but failed extubation twice due to flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has failed extubation for the third time due to laryngeal edema. She has a history of extubation failure twice previously, which may be related to abrupt removal of PEEP.
* Cardiovascular: She has demand ischemia with no proximal coronary stenoses, but biventricular diastolic dysfunction on cath. She may have distal, small vessel disease, but no active ischemia.
* Renal: She has acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, but the baseline is unclear. She has pre-renal azotemia and may have free water deficit.
* Hematology: She has anemia, but her hemoglobin level is stable.
* Endocrine: She has diabetes mellitus and is being managed with insulin.
* Pulmonary: She has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has been stable according to her outside pulmonologist.
* Gastrointestinal: She has been on tube feeds, which will be held pending extubation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 268 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 32 mmol/L
* Serum albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Tracheostomy placement, which will be discussed with the interventional pulmonology team
* Discontinuation of vancomycin therapy due to improvement in radiological infiltrate and absence of clinical signs of infection
* Continued ASA 81 and statin therapy for demand ischemia
* Titration of Lopressor to a heart rate of 65 as blood pressure allows
* Discontinuation of captopril due to potential for laryngeal edema
* Monitoring of hemoglobin level daily, with transfusion if it falls below 21%
* Repletion of free water deficit and monitoring of creatinine level daily

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema or upper airway obstruction
* Cardiac ischemia or infarction due to demand ischemia or small vessel disease
* Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease due to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer or peptic ulcer disease
* Infection or sepsis due to pneumonia, bacteremia, or other sources
* Worsening of COPD or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to respiratory failure or infection."

   Patient failed extubation due to vocal cord edema and stridor. ACE
   inhibitor to be stopped. Given three failed extubations, admittedly
   probably due to different mechanisms, will proceed to trach. We are
   also concerned that the stridor was significant despite the air leak
   when the cuff was taken down; thus, may be difficult to predict when
   the laryngeal edema has resolved. Surgery consulted (percutaneous trach
   cannot be done due to previous procedures in neck). Decadron continues.
   Maintain volume status even. Patient is hypernatremic; should have fee
   water replaced.
   Completing antibiotics for pneumonia. Will reassess off antibiotics.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion today.
   Continue on inhaled bronchodilators.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient failed extubation due to vocal cord edema and stridor. ACE
   inhibitor to be stopped. Given three failed extubations, admittedly
   probably due to different mechanisms, will proceed to trach. We are
   also concerned that the stridor was significant despite the air leak
   when the cuff was taken down; thus, may be difficult to predict when
   the laryngeal edema has resolved. Surgery consulted (percutaneous trach
   cannot be done due to previous procedures in neck). Decadron continues.
   Maintain volume status even. Patient is hypernatremic; should have fee
   water replaced.
   Completing antibiotics for pneumonia. Will reassess off antibiotics.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion today.
   Continue on inhaled bronchodilators.

   Patient is critically ill
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25**], MD<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, diastolic chronic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient had worsening stridor during the evening, necessitating reintubation with a 6.5 ETT and reinstitution of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/38 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated levels of lactate, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's blood count shows a white blood cell count of 12.3, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 268 K/uL.

The patient's medical history includes a previous diagnosis of pneumonia, and the patient is currently receiving antibiotics for this condition. The patient is also receiving medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including inhaled bronchodilators.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure
2. Chronic heart failure, diastolic
3. COPD
4. Anemia
5. Hypernatremia
6. Pneumonia

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for pneumonia
* Maintaining volume status
* Replacing free water to correct hypernatremia
* Continuing inhaled bronchodilators
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and adjusting ventilation as necessary
* Considering tracheostomy due to failed extubations and concerns about laryngeal edema

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening lung disease or ventilator-associated lung injury
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to underlying heart disease
* Infection or sepsis due to pneumonia or other underlying conditions
* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to anticoagulation therapy or underlying coagulopathy
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to prolonged illness and hospitalization
* Psychological distress or anxiety due to prolonged hospitalization and illness."

   24 Hour Events:
   Was examined by Thorasic surgery yesterday- plan is to perform open
   trach today. Tube feeds have been held since midnight.
   ACEI was d/c'd for the (small) likelihood that it may have contributed
   to laryngeal edema.
   Vanc was d/c'd yesterday as pt completed 7-day course for PNA.
   Pt was at +500cc at 5 PM, thus was given Lasix 10 mg IV to match I/O

   3rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home
   O2-dependent, p/w resp failure following extubation after ERCP, now
   failed extubation for the 3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Awaiting
   open trach placement
   24 Hour Events:
   Was examined by Thorasic surgery yesterday- plan is to perform open
   trach today. Tube feeds have been held since midnight.
   ACEI was d/c'd for the (small) likelihood that it may have contributed
   to laryngeal edema.
   Vanc was d/c'd yesterday as pt completed 7-day course for PNA.
   Pt was at +500cc at 5 PM, thus was given Lasix 10 mg IV to match I/O
   goal of even.
   Otherwise doing well.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent left upper lobe lobectomy and is currently on oxygen therapy at home. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, and has failed extubation twice due to laryngeal edema. The patient is awaiting open tracheostomy placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.3-13.2 x10^9/L
* Hct: 27.8-28.9%
* Plt: 315 x10^9/L
* Cr: 1.2-1.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 40-41 mmHg
* Glucose: 121-157 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated troponin-T, CK, and CKMB levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema
* GPC bacteremia (likely contamination)
* MRSA-positive sputum
* Demand ischemia (biventricular diastolic dysfunction)
* Anemia (Hct stable)
* Acute renal failure (Cr 1.4 mg/dL)
* COPD (stable per patient's outside pulmonologist)
* DM (RISS)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening laryngeal edema or upper airway obstruction
* Cardiac ischemia or infarction due to demand ischemia or underlying cardiac disease
* Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function due to pre-renal azotemia or ATN
* Infection or sepsis due to GPC bacteremia or MRSA-positive sputum
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance or inadequate glucose control
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid and electrolyte shifts or underlying medical conditions

The patient's plan includes:

* Open tracheostomy placement today or tomorrow
* Holding tube feeds for now
* Monitoring I/O and repleting electrolytes as needed
* Continuing ASA 81, statin, and Lopressor to HR 65
* Discontinuing vancomycin and heparin due to improved radiological findings and absence of active infection
* Monitoring Cr daily and transfusing if Hct < 21%
* Continuing atrovent/albuterol MDI and outpatient follow-up with repeat PFTs for COPD
* Continuing propofol sedation and repleting lytes to keep K > 4, Mg > 2, and Ca WNL."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: 80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home
   O2-dependent, p/w resp failure following extubation after ERCP, now
   failed extubation for the 3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Awaiting
   open trach placement
   24 Hour Events:
   Was examined by Thorasic surgery yesterday- plan is to perform open
   trach today. Tube feeds have been held since midnight.
   ACEI was d/c'd for the (small) likelihood that it may have contributed
   to laryngeal edema.
   Vanc was d/c'd yesterday as pt completed 7-day course for PNA.
   Pt was at +500cc at 5 PM, thus was given Lasix 10 mg IV to match I/O
   goal of even.
   Otherwise doing well.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, and is O2-dependent. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, and has since failed extubation for the third time due to laryngeal edema. She is awaiting open tracheostomy placement.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/51 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.3 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 315 K/μL. Her liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an AST of 31 IU/L and ALT of 56 IU/L. Her renal function is stable, with a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include acute respiratory failure, laryngeal edema, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia. She also has a history of lung cancer, and may have small vessel disease causing biventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is unable to be extubated, or if she develops ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Laryngeal edema: The patient's laryngeal edema may worsen if not treated, leading to upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia is high, and may worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of lung cancer and possible small vessel disease may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's tube feeds are on hold, and may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not reinitiated promptly.
8. Medication interactions: The patient is taking multiple medications, and may be at risk for medication interactions or adverse effects.

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and consider reinitiating tube feeds if she is unable to be extubated.
2. Treat the patient's laryngeal edema with decadron taper, and consider repeating ABG to assess for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function, and consider reinitiating Lasix if her creatinine level increases.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, and consider adjusting her medication regimen if necessary.
5. Consider repeating WBC differential to assess for PMN predominance or left shift, and to monitor for signs of recurrent pneumonia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status, and consider reinitiating tube feeds if necessary.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to minimize medication interactions or adverse effects."

   5) Laryngeal edema
   Stable overnight on the ventilator. Would recheck ABG. Reduce minute
   venitilation if pH is alkalemic. Will be easier to extubate patient
   with higher PaCO2 and compensatory renal response. Alkalemic pH will
   lead to loss of bicarb from kidney. Patient to have surgical trach
   today.
   Continues on decadron for laryngeal edema.
   CXR still shows evidence of total body volume overload. Will need
   further gentle diuresis. BUN/Creat remains elevated.
   Low grade fever. Monitor off of antibiotics. No change in tracheal
   secretions.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and laryngeal edema.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 53 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/49 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, with a count of 315 K/uL, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), with a level of 582 U/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 4.2 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and/or atelectasis on a chest X-ray.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, with a goal of weaning the patient off the ventilator in the next few days. The patient will also receive antibiotics for a possible infection, and will have a surgical tracheostomy to facilitate extubation.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH level suggest the possibility of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic CHF and elevated levels of troponin-T suggest the possibility of cardiac complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated levels of BUN and creatinine suggest the possibility of renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's elevated levels of amylase and lipase suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU following an elective ERCP procedure. She has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube. The patient's cardiovascular status has been concerning, with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and nonspecific ST changes on electrocardiogram (EKG). She was previously ruled in for myocardial infarction (MI) based on elevated cardiac enzymes, but coronary catheterization showed normal coronary arteries.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/39 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's frequent PVCs and nonspecific ST changes on EKG may indicate underlying cardiac disease, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and an arterial oxygen saturation of 95%. She may be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if her oxygenation or ventilation requirements increase.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and mild anemia may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of lung cancer and COPD may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if she develops bleeding from the tracheostomy tube or other sources.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of lung cancer and COPD may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was placed yesterday
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.
   - [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 458**] for open trach today, pt NPO since midnight.
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - F/u with ENT regarding recs for decadron taper for laryngeal edema
   - Goal I/O even today and pt appears euvolemic clinically.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA). CXR
   findings fluctuate in terms of opacities/ consolidations.
   - Vanc was d/c
d after 7 day course.
   - WBC slightly up since yesterday (may be due to steroids), and pt has
   low grade fever. However given pt does not have increased sputum
   production, and lung exam stable, will reassess for any indications of
   recurrent pna.
   - check differential on WBC to assess any PMN predominance/ left shift.
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c

   -          Continue ASA 81, statin
   -          Titrate Lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -          monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.2, has been stable. Pt has free water
   deficit likely due to Lasix gtt which was stopped two nights ago.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is dependent on oxygen therapy at home. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following elective intubation for ERCP, and has since failed three extubation attempts due to laryngeal edema.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, and has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a SpO2 of 95%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a heart rate of 89 beats per minute with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and nonspecific ST changes on electrocardiogram (EKG). Her blood pressure is 107/39 mmHg.
* Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to her intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.4 K/uL, and a slightly elevated troponin-T level of 0.71 ng/mL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and her need for mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's frequent PVCs and nonspecific ST changes on EKG may indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction, which could lead to cardiac arrest or other complications.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and troponin-T level may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL may indicate acute kidney injury, which could lead to end-stage renal disease.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL may indicate anemia, which could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider adding antiarrhythmic medications if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including WBC count and troponin-T level, to assess for sepsis or cardiac complications.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting her fluid and electrolyte therapy as necessary.
* Consider transfusing the patient with packed red blood cells if her hemoglobin level falls below 10 g/dL.
* Continue tube feeds on hold until the patient's tracheostomy tube is secured, and then restart tube feeds at a rate of 30 mL/hour.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider adjusting her electrolyte therapy as necessary.
* Continue prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal medications as ordered."

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was placed yesterday
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Trach placed successfully yesterday by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   - Was on vent, now on trach mask.  Monitor closely for any signs of
   resp distress
   - Repeat ABG this AM, check CXR as one was not done this AM.
   - Continue Decadron taper per ENT recs.
   - D/C all sedating meds, keep pt alert.
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR was high normal today (usually bradycardic), but likely due to
   decreased sedation, and pt became anxious leading to increased HR. EKG
   with non specific ST changes.
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   -          Continue ASA 81, statin
   -          Restart Lopressor as pt no longer bradycardic.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA). - WBC
   slightly up since [**2103-6-26**] (likely due to steroids; also transient inc
   in WBC due to surgery yesterday), and pt afebrile.  BCx from [**6-22**] neg.
   - Vanc was d/c
d after 7 day course.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, and lung exam
   stable, will reassess for any indications of recurrent pna and hold off
   on further antibiotics.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -          monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.2, has been stable. Pt was repleted for
   free water deficit  that was likely caused by Lasix gtt (stopped 3 days
   ago)
   - Difficult to assess volume status clinically. Pt has a central line,
   will check CVP.
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   - Pt on Lasix at home; will add lasix if pt becomes volume overloaded.
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was placed yesterday
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Trach placed successfully yesterday by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   - Was on vent, now on trach mask.  Monitor closely for any signs of
   resp distress
   - Repeat ABG this AM, check CXR as one was not done this AM.
   - Continue Decadron taper per ENT recs.
   - D/C all sedating meds, keep pt alert.
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR was high normal today (usually bradycardic), but likely due to
   decreased sedation, and pt became anxious leading to increased HR. EKG
   with non specific ST changes.
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   -          Continue ASA 81, statin
   -          Restart Lopressor as pt no longer bradycardic.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA). - WBC
   slightly up since [**2103-6-26**] (likely due to steroids; also transient inc
   in WBC due to surgery yesterday), and pt afebrile.  BCx from [**6-22**] neg.
   - Vanc was d/c
d after 7 day course.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, and lung exam
   stable, will reassess for any indications of recurrent pna and hold off
   on further antibiotics.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -          monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.2, has been stable. Pt was repleted for
   free water deficit  that was likely caused by Lasix gtt (stopped 3 days
   ago)
   - Difficult to assess volume status clinically. Pt has a central line,
   will check CVP.
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   - Pt on Lasix at home; will add lasix if pt becomes volume overloaded.
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   -          Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   -          outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   -          Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds
   -          I/O goal today= even
   -          Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Access: R A-line, LIJ (consider starting a PIV and pulling LIJ)

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure after extubation following ERCP. She has a history of lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent. She has failed extubation three times, including the current attempt due to laryngeal edema, and has been placed on a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on a tracheostomy mask and is being monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress. An ABG will be repeated this morning, and a chest X-ray will be checked.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of demand ischemia, but her coronary catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. However, she has biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension. Her cardiac enzymes are being monitored, and she is taking ASA 81 and a statin.
* Infection: The patient has a MRSA-positive sputum culture and has been treated with vancomycin for 7 days. She is currently afebrile and has no increased sputum production.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. She is being repleted for a free water deficit and is on Lasix.
* Nutrition: The patient has a Dobhoff tube for tube feeds and is being repleted with electrolytes.
* Blood products: The patient has received 900 mL of blood products since admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and laryngeal edema.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's MRSA-positive sputum culture and history of ventilator-associated pneumonia may lead to further infections.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's tube feeds may not be adequate to meet her nutritional needs, leading to malnutrition.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Patient on trach mask now. Oxygenation 97% sat; ABG is good. Patient's
   work of breathing seems a bit increased. She is awake but not fully
   communicative yet; this is similar to the last time that we stopped
   sedation on her. It took some time before she became fully alert. I
   suspect as she is able to communicate better, she may appear more
   comfortable. Few rales on exam. BUN/Creat still elevated but rales on
   exam. Check CVP.
   Continue bronchodilators. Decadron to be tapered.
   Hct down slightly. No need for transfusion now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient on trach mask now. Oxygenation 97% sat; ABG is good. Patient's
   work of breathing seems a bit increased. She is awake but not fully
   communicative yet; this is similar to the last time that we stopped
   sedation on her. It took some time before she became fully alert. I
   suspect as she is able to communicate better, she may appear more
   comfortable. Few rales on exam. BUN/Creat still elevated but rales on
   exam. Check CVP.
   Continue bronchodilators. Decadron to be tapered.
   Hct down slightly. No need for transfusion now.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, cholangitis, and CHF-diastolic. They had a surgical tracheostomy yesterday and were placed on a trach mask this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 137/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode and have a respiratory rate of 27 inspirations per minute. The patient's ABG results are 7.44/45/90, indicating a slight respiratory acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, particularly if the patient's underlying respiratory disease is not adequately managed.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of cholangitis, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and even death if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. CHF-diastolic: The patient's CHF-diastolic condition can worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased congestion, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory rate and ABG results suggest that they may be at risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Sepsis: The patient's history of cholangitis and respiratory failure increases their risk of developing sepsis, particularly if they develop a secondary infection.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of frequent PVCs and PACs increases their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if their electrolyte levels become abnormal.
8. Neurological compromise: The patient's sedation and mechanical ventilation increase their risk of neurological compromise, particularly if they develop a secondary neurological injury.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of CHF-diastolic and respiratory failure increases their risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension.
10. Infection: The patient's history of cholangitis and respiratory failure increases their risk of developing a secondary infection, particularly if they have a compromised immune system.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust their mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Manage the patient's cholangitis aggressively, including antibiotics and drainage if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's CHF-diastolic condition closely and adjust their diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Manage the patient's anemia with blood transfusions if necessary.
5. Consider antibiotic therapy for the patient's respiratory failure.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust their electrolyte replacement therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust their anti-arrhythmic therapy as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust their sedation therapy as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and adjust their anti-emetic therapy as needed.
10. Consider transferring the patient to a higher-level care facility if their condition worsens or if they require more intensive care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual who weighs 101.1 kg and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure following extubation attempt.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/49 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92% on 50% tracheal mask.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their inability to assess certain areas, such as peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) 11.5-16.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb) 10.4-12.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt) 38-103 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) 1.2-1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T 0.03 ng/mL
* Lactic acid 2.6 mmol/L
* Albumin 3.2 g/dL
* Calcium 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus 2.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including Lopressor, fentanyl, propofol, dexamethasone, Lasix, famotidine, and heparin.

The patient's flow sheet data shows:

* Fluid balance: 2,474 mL in, 1,362 mL out
* Urine output: 1,357 mL
* Blood products: 1,362 mL
* Respiratory support: 50% tracheal mask, standby ventilator mode

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory status due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation
* Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation and respiratory support
* Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infection or inadequate antibiotic therapy
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, due to underlying cardiac disease or medication toxicity
* Renal failure or worsening of renal function due to inadequate fluid management or underlying kidney disease
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, due to inadequate stress ulcer prophylaxis or underlying gastrointestinal disease.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Continue to hold anxiolytics/ sedatives.
   - Continue steroid taper for laryngeal edema per ENT recs
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50 with 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - Decrease Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA). - WBC
   slightly up since [**2103-6-26**]
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to time and
   dose of steroid being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, and lung exam
   stable, will reassess for any indications of recurrent pna and hold off
   on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day course of Vanco).
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.2, has been stable.
   - CVP adequate, but likely somewhat volume overloaded. Pt was on Lasix
   at home. Will use one-time doses of Lasix to maintain fluid balance.
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds
   - Sp and Sw consult for assessment of aspiration risk and passy-muir

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Continue to hold anxiolytics/ sedatives.
   - Continue steroid taper for laryngeal edema per ENT recs
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50 with 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - Decrease Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA). - WBC
   slightly up since [**2103-6-26**]
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to time and
   dose of steroid being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, and lung exam
   stable, will reassess for any indications of recurrent pna and hold off
   on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day course of Vanco).
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.2, has been stable.
   - CVP adequate, but likely somewhat volume overloaded. Pt was on Lasix
   at home. Will use one-time doses of Lasix to maintain fluid balance.
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds
   - Sp and Sw consult for assessment of aspiration risk and passy-muir
   valve placement
   - Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Access: Arterial line not working well. Will d/c as pt no longer
   requires frequent ABG checks. [**Name (NI) 3871**] (pt a difficult stick
 IV team to
   attempt PIV then pull [**Name (NI) 3871**])
   # PPX: SubQ Hep, pneumoboots, H2 blocker, elevate HOB
   # Code: Full code as per discussion with pt and family.
   # Dispo: ICU for now as she requires frequent suctions and while Sp &
   Sw consult is pending.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female who has undergone a left upper lobe lobectomy for lung cancer and is home oxygen-dependent. She has experienced three failed extubation attempts due to laryngeal edema and has been successfully intubated. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on a tracheostomy and is tolerating it well, with an oxygen saturation of 96-100% on 50% tracheal mask. She has decreased breath sounds in the bases and rhonchi over bilateral lungs.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 55-88 bpm and a blood pressure of 139/49-169/75 mmHg. She has a history of demand ischemia and biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, which has been stable. She is volume-overloaded and is receiving Lasix to maintain fluid balance.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL and is being monitored for transfusion if her hemoglobin level drops below 21%.
* Infectious: The patient has MRSA-positive sputum and is being monitored for signs of recurrent pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of failed extubation attempts and laryngeal edema puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of demand ischemia and biventricular diastolic dysfunction puts her at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and volume-overload put her at risk for further renal deterioration.
* Infection: The patient's MRSA-positive sputum and history of failed extubation attempts put her at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Bleeding: The patient's history of demand ischemia and use of anticoagulants put her at risk for bleeding complications.

The plan of care includes:

* Continuing the patient on a tracheostomy and monitoring her for signs of respiratory failure.
* Decreasing the dose of Lopressor to 6.25 mg and considering alternative medications such as captopril or enalapril.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's renal function and volume status, and using Lasix as needed to maintain fluid balance.
* Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin level and transfusing if necessary.
* Monitoring the patient's infectious status and treating any signs of recurrent pneumonia.
* Continuing to manage the patient's cardiovascular status and treating any signs of cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

* The patient is a 65-inch tall, 101.1 kg (224 lbs) male with a history of COPD, cholangitis, and chronic heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction.
* The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off the ventilator.
* The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 272.
* The patient has been receiving treatment for cholangitis, including antibiotics and supportive care.
* The patient has been experiencing anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL.
* The patient has been receiving treatment for CHF, including diuretics and beta-blockers.
* The patient has been experiencing chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if the PaO2/FiO2 ratio decreases or if the patient develops pneumonia.
* Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis could worsen if the infection spreads or if the patient develops sepsis.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if the patient experiences bleeding or if the patient's hemoglobin level continues to decline.
* Chronic heart failure: The patient's CHF could worsen if the patient experiences worsening of cardiac function or if the patient develops cardiac arrhythmias.
* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease could worsen if the patient experiences worsening of kidney function or if the patient develops acute kidney injury.
* Sepsis: The patient could develop sepsis if the patient's infection worsens or if the patient develops a secondary infection.
* Pneumonia: The patient could develop pneumonia if the patient's respiratory failure worsens or if the patient develops a secondary infection.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient could develop ARDS if the patient's respiratory failure worsens or if the patient develops a secondary infection.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient could develop cardiac arrhythmias if the patient's CHF worsens or if the patient develops a secondary infection.
* Renal failure: The patient could develop renal failure if the patient's chronic kidney disease worsens or if the patient develops acute kidney injury."

   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, who is home oxygen-dependent and has experienced respiratory failure following extubation attempts after ERCP. She has undergone three failed extubation attempts, with the most recent attempt being due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully performed on [**2103-6-27**].

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on a tracheostomy and is tolerating it well. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a heart rate of 58-69 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 130/49-161/66 mmHg. She has a history of demand ischemia and has been diagnosed with biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. She is receiving Lasix for fluid management and has a CVP of 7 mmHg.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been started on a pureed diet. She has had one formed stool in the past.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented in the note, but she is responding to stimuli and has no signs of increased intracranial pressure.
* Infectious: The patient has MRSA-positive sputum and has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin. She is being monitored for signs of recurrent pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and has undergone three failed extubation attempts. She may continue to experience respiratory distress and may require further interventions such as mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of demand ischemia and has been diagnosed with biventricular diastolic dysfunction. She may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and may continue to experience worsening renal function if not managed appropriately.
* Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA-positive sputum and has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin. She may be at risk for developing recurrent pneumonia if not properly managed.
* Tracheostomy-related complications: The patient has a tracheostomy and may be at risk for complications such as tracheal stenosis or bleeding.

In summary, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, and has failed extubation attempts three times due to laryngeal edema. She was successfully placed on a tracheostomy (trach) on [**2103-6-27**].

The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal limits, except for a slightly low blood pressure. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94% on 50% trach collar. Her lungs are clear, with decreased rales compared to yesterday.

The patient has a history of MRSA-positive sputum, which may be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her leukocytosis is likely due to steroids, and she does not have increased sputum production, fevers, or lung exam/CXR findings that would indicate recurrent pneumonia. Therefore, it is recommended to hold off on further antibiotics.

The patient has demand ischemia, with no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular diastolic dysfunction on catheterization. She may have distal, small vessel disease, and no active ischemia. Her troponin peaked on [**6-19**], and heparin was discontinued after 48 hours.

The patient's anemia is stable, with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. Her acute renal failure is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. She is being treated with Lasix 60mg PO BID and will be monitored for goal I/Os of -0.5 L today.

The patient's COPD has been stable per her outside pulmonologist. She is being treated with atrovent/albuterol MDI and will have outpatient follow-up with repeat PFTs.

The patient's mental status is improving, with the ability to follow commands off and on. She is able to verbalize, and reassessment will be done once she can do so.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and laryngeal edema puts her at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of MRSA-positive sputum and leukocytosis puts her at risk for developing pneumonia.
3. Ischemia: The patient's demand ischemia and history of troponin elevation put her at risk for further ischemic events.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and history of hypertension put her at risk for further renal complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding put her at risk for further anemia.
6. Mental status changes: The patient's history of mental status changes and medication use put her at risk for further changes in mental status.
7. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA-positive sputum and leukocytosis put her at risk for developing infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended to continue her current treatment plan, including her trach, antibiotics, and medications. Further monitoring and reassessment will be necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing ERCP and experiencing respiratory failure following extubation. He has been diagnosed with sinus bradycardia, and his vital signs are stable. He has been receiving trazadone for sleep and Lasix for excess fluid. His gastrointestinal symptoms have improved, and he has been tolerating a pureed diet without aspiration. His lab results show normal to mildly elevated values for most parameters, with the exception of a slightly elevated troponin level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he is not properly ventilated or if he develops pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay make him susceptible to infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus bradycardia and slightly elevated troponin level may indicate cardiac strain, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms may worsen if he develops gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to worsening respiratory failure, cardiac complications, or kidney injury.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's compromised neurological status may worsen if he develops neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
7. Wound complications: The patient's surgical wound may become infected or develop complications such as dehiscence or hematoma.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Perform regular assessments for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, or increased white blood cell count.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his medications as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and adjust his diet and medications as needed to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and adjust his fluid intake and diuretic medications as needed to prevent fluid overload.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his medications as needed to prevent neurological complications.
7. Monitor the patient's wound status closely and adjust his wound care as needed to prevent wound complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male who was admitted for elective ERCP for recurrent abdominal pain. The patient was intubated electively and later developed tracheal edema, leading to three failed extubations. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy tube.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/45 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal heart rhythm and no murmurs. The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, distended abdomen.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.7 K/uL, which is elevated. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.03, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 2.7 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, show a tracheostomy tube in place with reduced opacities at the bases after diuresis.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure
2. Leukocytosis
3. Delirium/anxiety
4. NSTEMI

The plan includes sending a C. difficile test, adding a differential and monoclonal antibody to the patient's treatment regimen, and monitoring the patient's white blood cell count trend after discontinuing steroids. The patient's mental status is difficult to assess, and the healthcare team will continue to encourage oral intake while providing tube feeds. The patient will also be encouraged to move from bed to chair and will require rehabilitation after discharge.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Tracheostomy tube complications, such as tube displacement or blockage
3. Leukocytosis and potential infection
4. NSTEMI and potential cardiac complications
5. Delirium and anxiety, which can lead to agitation and increased risk of falls
6. Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular function

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted for elective ERCP for recurrent abdominal pain. She was intubated electively and later developed laryngeal edema, requiring a tracheostomy. The patient has had three failed extubations.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her oxygen saturation is 93%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and her blood pressure is 109/45 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient is not assessed for neurological function due to her intubation and tracheostomy.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and her BUN/Creat ratio is elevated.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place and is receiving tube feeds.
* Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, and cultures have been sent to rule out infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation.
* Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and cough may indicate pneumonia, which would require antibiotics and further evaluation.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated BUN/Creat ratio and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which would require aggressive management and monitoring.
* Tracheostomy complications: The patient's tracheostomy tube may become displaced or cause bleeding, which would require prompt intervention.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nasogastric tube may cause gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, which would require surgical intervention.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sinus bradycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which would require close monitoring and management.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy tube
* Monitoring for signs of infection and sepsis
* Adjusting diuretic dose to achieve a negative fluid balance
* Tapering steroids for vocal cord edema
* Encouraging oral intake and tube feeds
* Encouraging bed-to-chair mobility and rehab after discharge
* Screening for signs of infection and sepsis
* Monitoring for cardiovascular instability and adjusting management accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 101.1 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of allergy to penicillins, which caused hives. He is receiving various medications, including famotidine and heparin sodium. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/49 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via tracheal mask and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to move or respond to stimuli. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.2-20.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 12.3-35.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 364-22 x 10^9/L. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL. His liver function is also impaired, with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and impaired renal function may indicate the presence of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and impaired oxygenation may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus bradycardia and potential cardiac conduction abnormalities may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's impaired platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and impaired liver function may indicate the presence of liver failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function and elevated creatinine level may indicate the presence of renal failure.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and impaired gut function may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
8. Infection: The patient's impaired immune function and elevated white blood cell count may increase the risk of infection.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and management to prevent or treat them effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent left upper lobe lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, and has since failed extubation attempts twice due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully performed on [**2103-6-27**]. The patient has MRSA-positive sputum, which may be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has demand ischemia, anemia, acute renal failure, COPD, and diabetes. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, steroids, and medications for hypertension and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. VAP: The patient's MRSA-positive sputum may indicate VAP, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent worsening kidney function.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she may require blood transfusions to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to her tissues.
5. Demand ischemia: The patient's demand ischemia may be a sign of underlying coronary artery disease, which could increase her risk of myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
6. Laryngeal edema: The patient's laryngeal edema may recur, especially if she is not receiving adequate treatment or if she is experiencing anxiety or stress.
7. Wound infection: The patient's tracheostomy site may be at risk for infection, especially if she is not receiving adequate wound care or if she has a compromised immune system.
8. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's central venous catheter may be at risk for infection, especially if it is not properly maintained or if she has a compromised immune system.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and she requires continued close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications. The plan includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Monitor and treat VAP if present.
3. Monitor and treat acute kidney injury.
4. Transfuse blood if necessary to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
5. Continue treatment for demand ischemia, including medication and lifestyle modifications.
6. Monitor and treat laryngeal edema.
7. Provide adequate wound care to prevent infection at the tracheostomy site.
8. Monitor and treat catheter-related bloodstream infection if present."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach. Satting well on FiO2 40%. Still
   with frequent cough and yellow sputum.
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema [**6-30**].
   - Consider weaning FIO2 down further, transitioning off of trach mask
   as tolerated.
   - Continue chest PT. Will schedule Albuterol/Atrovent nebs.
   - Will give Mucomyst q8 to help with secretions.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.  Trended down today.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   # Hypertension: Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50
   with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Was decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] [**6-29**]. Episode of hypotension
   to 90s yesterday.
   - Continue Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Will d/c Amlodipine, as pt currently intermittently hypotensive.
   - Will also decrease Lasix to pt
s home dose of Lasix 40mg PO bid.
   Previously increased because UOP did not respond adequately, but will
   re-try given intermittent hypotension.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr has been stable (1.1-1.2)
   - Will resume home dose of Lasix 40mg PO BID. Will monitor I/Os for
   goal= - 0.5 L today.
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds. Will cycle it so pt can eat
   orally using the passy-muir valve.
   - Nutrition consult to adjust tube feeds as pt is eating now. Consider
   holding tube feeds during the day to encourage PO intake.
   - Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Mental status; able to follow commands off and on.
   - Appears to be improving. Continue to monitor. Will check with family
   also.
   # Access: Arterial line and LIJ d/c
d [**6-29**]. Has 2 PIVs now.
   # PPX: SubQ Hep, pneumoboots, H2 blocker, elevate HOB
   # Code: Full code as per discussion with pt and family.
   # Dispo: ICU for now as she requires frequent suctions and supervision
   with PO intake. PT to eval today or tomorrow. Pt approved for [**Hospital 1225**]
   rehab, but prefers [**Hospital3 **] rehab (pending approval.)  Will likely d/c
   to rehab early this week.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old female, has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following three failed extubations. She was successfully intubated on [**2103-6-27**] and is currently on a tracheostomy mask with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient is tolerating soft solids and tube feeds, and has been weaned to 40% tracheostomy mask.

The patient has a history of lung cancer, and her respiratory failure is likely related to laryngeal edema. She has also had a recent episode of hypotension, which has been resolved without intervention. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 123/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. Her liver function tests are slightly elevated, with an AST of 56 IU/L and ALT of 31 IU/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include famotidine, heparin, and lasix, and she is also receiving nutrition through a Dobhoff tube. Her medical history includes hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing on the tracheostomy mask, assessing for improvement in laryngeal edema, and weaning the patient off the tracheostomy mask as tolerated. The patient will also continue to receive chest physical therapy and will be scheduled for albuterol and atrovent nebs. The patient's demand ischemia is being managed with Lopressor, and her hypertension is being treated with amlodipine and lasix.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent pneumonia: The patient's history of MRSA-positive sputum and worsening leukocytosis suggests that she may be at risk for recurrent pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to laryngeal edema, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of demand ischemia and hypertension may increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may require further management, including dialysis or nephrology consultation.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's tube feeds may require adjustment to ensure adequate nutrition and prevent complications such as malnutrition or dehydration.
6. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has been reported as able to follow commands off and on, and she may require continued monitoring and management to prevent further decline.
7. Skin complications: The patient's history of pneumoboots and subQ Hep injections may increase her risk for skin complications, such as infections or pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema today.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50 with 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Was decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] yesterday
   - Continue Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.1 today, has been stable.
   - Started home dose of Lasix 60mg PO BID. Will monitor I/Os for goal= -
   0.5 L today
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds. Will cycle it so pt can eat
   orally using the passy-muir valve.
   - Nutrition consult to adjust tube feeds as pt is eating now
   - Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Mental status; able to follow commands off and on.
   - Appears to be improving. Reassess once she can verbalize. Will check
   with family also.
   # Access: Arterial line and LIJ d/c

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema today.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50 with 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Was decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] yesterday
   - Continue Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.1 today, has been stable.
   - Started home dose of Lasix 60mg PO BID. Will monitor I/Os for goal= -
   0.5 L today
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt

   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds. Will cycle it so pt can eat
   orally using the passy-muir valve.
   - Nutrition consult to adjust tube feeds as pt is eating now
   - Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Mental status; able to follow commands off and on.
   - Appears to be improving. Reassess once she can verbalize. Will check
   with family also.
   # Access: Arterial line and LIJ d/c

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure after three failed extubations due to laryngeal edema. She has a history of lung cancer, lung lobectomy, and is home oxygen-dependent. She has been on a tracheostomy since June 27th and is currently tolerating 40% tracheostomy mask. She has also been experiencing difficulty passing stool and has been trying to pass a bowel movement for approximately 60 minutes. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/49 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient has been experiencing some complications, including leukocytosis, which is likely due to the steroids given for laryngeal edema. Her blood work shows elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and creatinine. She has also been experiencing some cardiac issues, including demand ischemia and biventricular diastolic dysfunction on catheterization. She has been started on Lasix 60mg PO BID for acute renal failure and is being monitored for goal I/Os of -0.5 L today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring her respiratory status closely.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to the steroids given for laryngeal edema, but it is essential to monitor her white blood cell count and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
3. Demand ischemia: The patient's demand ischemia is a concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring her cardiac status closely.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring her kidney function and adjust her medication accordingly.
5. Bowel obstruction: The patient's difficulty passing stool is a concern, and it is essential to monitor her bowel movement and consider further evaluation if necessary.
6. Infection: The patient's MRSA-positive sputum culture is a concern, and it is essential to monitor her for signs of infection and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's biventricular diastolic dysfunction on catheterization is a concern, and it is essential to monitor her cardiac status closely for any signs of cardiovascular complications."

   80F with chronic abdominal pain, admitted for elective ercp, intubated
   electively, s/p three failed extubations, now trached, doing well with
   passy-muir valve. The last failed extubation was due to laryngeal
   edema. She has completed a course of dexamethasone, with presumed
   near-complete resolution of laryngeal edema since the patient is able
   to talk.
   Her heart failure with normal EF was the cause of her prior two
   re-intubations. She is now euvolemic, and has good blood pressure and
   HR control on the current regimen.
   Patient is still getting tube feed through an NG tube. She is
   tolerating POs, and nutrition is working with the patient to take me
   POs. Expect continued improvement; no need for PEG.
   Patient has been evaluate by rehab. Likely discharge to rehab tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted for an elective ERCP procedure but has experienced three failed extubations, with the last one due to laryngeal edema. She is currently intubated and using a Passy-Muir valve. Her medical history includes chronic abdominal pain, COPD, and heart failure with normal ejection fraction. She is currently euvolemic and has good blood pressure and HR control on her current medication regimen. She is tolerating POs and is being fed through an NG tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of three failed extubations and current intubation status puts her at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Laryngeal edema: The patient's last failed extubation was due to laryngeal edema, which could recur if not properly managed.
3. Heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure with normal ejection fraction puts her at risk for cardiac complications, such as worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. COPD: The patient's history of COPD puts her at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count puts her at risk for infection or sepsis.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's use of an NG tube for nutrition and her history of chronic abdominal pain may put her at risk for malnutrition.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and use of a tracheostomy tube put her at risk for pressure ulcers.
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and history of heart failure put her at risk for deep vein thrombosis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently doing well with her Passy-Muir valve and is tolerating POs. She is being fed through an NG tube and is expected to continue improving. The patient is likely to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility tomorrow. The ICU team is monitoring her closely for any signs of complications and is working to prevent them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   80F with chronic abdominal pain, admitted for elective ercp, intubated
   electively, s/p three failed extubations, now trached, doing well with
   passy-muir valve. The last failed extubation was due to laryngeal
   edema. She has completed a course of dexamethasone, with presumed
   near-complete resolution of laryngeal edema since the patient is able
   to talk. WBC is coming down without antibitiotics.
   Her heart failure with normal EF was the cause of her prior two
   re-intubations. She is now euvolemic, and has good blood pressure and
   HR control on the current regimen.
   Patient is still getting tube feed through an NG tube. She is
   tolerating POs, and nutrition is working with the patient to take me
   POs. Expect continued improvement; no need for PEG.
   Patient has been evaluate by rehab. Likely discharge to rehab tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old female, is admitted for elective ERCP and has been intubated electively. She has experienced three failed extubations, with the last one due to laryngeal edema. She is currently trached and using a Passy-Muir valve.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% and an ABG of 34/34. She is tolerating oral medications and has completed a course of dexamethasone, which has likely resolved her laryngeal edema.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg and a heart rate of 62 bpm. She has heart failure with normal EF and is euvolemic.

The patient's nutritional status is stable, with tube feedings through an NG tube and tolerating POs. She is being evaluated by rehab and is likely to be discharged to rehab tomorrow.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.2-20.7 K/uL
* Hct: 28.9-35.4%
* Plt: 364 K/uL
* Cr: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.03
* TCO2: 32
* Glucose: 115-174 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to tracheostomy tube displacement or obstruction
* Laryngeal edema recurrence
* Heart failure exacerbation due to fluid overload or medication non-compliance
* Wound infection or sepsis due to NG tube placement
* Malnutrition or dehydration due to inadequate oral intake or tube feeding issues
* DVT or PE due to immobility or venous stasis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach. Satting well on FiO2 40%. Still
   with frequent cough and yellow sputum.
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema [**6-30**].
   - Consider weaning FIO2 down further, transitioning off of trach mask
   as tolerated.
   - Continue chest PT. Will schedule Albuterol/Atrovent nebs.
   - Will give Mucomyst q8 to help with secretions.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.  Trended down today.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   # Hypertension: Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50
   with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Was decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] [**6-29**]. Episode of hypotension
   to 90s yesterday.
   - Continue Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Will d/c Amlodipine, as pt currently intermittently hypotensive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach. Satting well on FiO2 40%. Still
   with frequent cough and yellow sputum.
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema [**6-30**].

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She has experienced respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP and has failed extubation three times due to laryngeal edema. She now has a tracheostomy in place and is being managed with a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 40%. Her lung function is stable, but she still has frequent coughing and yellow sputum production. She has a history of MRSA pneumonia and leukocytosis, which has trended down today.

The patient also has demand ischemia, hypertension, anemia, acute renal failure, COPD, and diabetes. She is being managed with various medications, including heparin, Lopressor, Amlodipine, Lasix, and statin. She has a Dobhoff tube for tube feeds and is being repleted with electrolytes.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may experience further respiratory failure if her laryngeal edema does not improve.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia, and there is a risk of recurrent pneumonia if her immune system is compromised.
3. Ischemia: The patient has demand ischemia, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications if not managed properly.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is sensitive to Lopressor, and there is a risk of hypotension if the medication is not managed carefully.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if her fluid balance is not managed properly.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection or inflammation, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her bleeding is not managed properly.
8. COPD: The patient's COPD may exacerbate if her lung function is not managed properly.
9. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen if her blood sugar levels are not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her FiO2 and tracheostomy mask as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with Lopressor and monitor her blood pressure closely.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with fluid balance and electrolyte management.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and anemia and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's COPD with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes with insulin and monitor her blood sugar levels closely.
7. Consider weaning the patient off her tracheostomy mask and transitioning to a nasal cannula as tolerated.
8. Consider adjusting the patient's tube feeds to encourage oral intake and monitor her electrolyte levels closely.
9. Consider scheduling a nutrition consult to adjust the patient's tube feeds and monitor her nutritional status closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall, 101.1 kg (224 lbs) overweight/obese individual with a history of respiratory failure, COPD, and cholangitis. The patient is currently on a trach mask and has been weaned off the ventilator. They are receiving tube feeds and oral nutrition, with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 119/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, with a range of 16.4-20.7 x 10^9/L, and elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, with a PT/PTT/INR of 14.8/23.9/1.3.

The patient's imaging studies show pleural thickening on the left side, consistent with their previous diagnosis of cholangitis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue bronchodilators to manage COPD.
2. Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count.
3. Continue tube feeds and oral nutrition.
4. Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin sliding scale as needed.
5. Transfer the patient to a rehabilitation facility for further management and rehabilitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory distress syndrome.
2. COPD: Exacerbations, respiratory failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
3. Cholangitis: Sepsis, liver failure, and pancreaticitis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
