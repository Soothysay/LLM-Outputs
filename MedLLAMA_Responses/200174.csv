   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE, ?any underlying obstructive disease.  Pulmonary
   following on the floor.  Had reached stable point with worsening O2
   requirements over past 8-12 hours.  New fever at same time.  Likely
   some tachypnea a result of fever.  Also concern for pneumonia (HAP)
   given increasing and change in sputum and cough, fever, slight
   worsening of WBC count.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be volume overloaded with poor
   response to most recent 80 mg IV lasix dose and longstanding volume
   overload, despite meeting I/O goals on floor. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt.  Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Check BNP for comparisons to priors.
   - likely with replace Aline for hemodynamic monitoring on gtt plus
   access to frequent ABGs given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Vanc, Zosyn Cipro
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Check abd US given surgery; unable to do CT abd currently given
   respiratory status/inability to lie flat, but would consider this in
   future.
   - restart vanc for GPC coverage, start double gram negative with cipro
   and ?zosyn vs. meropenem.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil and anticoag for now.  Consideration for increase
   in sildenafil vs. endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - RHC in the future.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue therapeutic lovenox.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE.  Chronically anticoagulated.  Was also on plavix at some
   point with report of ?breakthrough clot on coumadin.  Reports
   hemoptysis on plavix.  Now on ASA plus lovenox. However with worsening
   renal function would consider hold
   - Continuing lovenox, holding coumadin as above.  Ideal anticoagulant
   for long term - lovenox or coumadin given ?coumadin failure.  Consider
   check factor X levels to ensure lovenox thereapeutic, though not
   morbidly obese and with normal renal function so would guess levels as
   expected.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Daily dressing changes.
   - wound care
   - pain control.
   - abdominal US to check for collections; consider CT abdomen.
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO until respiratory status
   improves, then regular DM/low Na
   # Prophylaxis: therapeutic lovenox.
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE, ?any underlying obstructive disease.  Pulmonary
   following on the floor.  Had reached stable point with worsening O2
   requirements over past 8-12 hours.  New fever at same time.  Likely
   some tachypnea a result of fever.  Also concern for pneumonia (HAP)
   given increasing and change in sputum and cough, fever, slight
   worsening of WBC count.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be volume overloaded with poor
   response to most recent 80 mg IV lasix dose and longstanding volume
   overload, despite meeting I/O goals on floor. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt.  Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Check BNP for comparisons to priors.
   - likely with replace Aline for hemodynamic monitoring on gtt plus
   access to frequent ABGs given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Vanc, Zosyn Cipro
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Check abd US given surgery; unable to do CT abd currently given
   respiratory status/inability to lie flat, but would consider this in
   future.
   - restart vanc for GPC coverage, start double gram negative with cipro
   and ?zosyn vs. meropenem.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil and anticoag for now.  Consideration for increase
   in sildenafil vs. endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - RHC in the future.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue therapeutic lovenox.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE.  Chronically anticoagulated.  Was also on plavix at some
   point with report of ?breakthrough clot on coumadin.  Reports
   hemoptysis on plavix.  Now on ASA plus lovenox. However with worsening
   renal function would consider hold
   - Continuing lovenox, holding coumadin as above.  Ideal anticoagulant
   for long term - lovenox or coumadin given ?coumadin failure.  Consider
   check factor X levels to ensure lovenox thereapeutic, though not
   morbidly obese and with normal renal function so would guess levels as
   expected.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a complex medical history, including severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, diastolic heart failure, and PFO closure. He is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing worsening oxygen requirements, likely due to his underlying pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic pulmonary embolism.
2. Fever: The patient has a new fever, which may be related to pneumonia (HAP) given the increasing and changing sputum and cough, fever, and slight worsening of WBC count.
3. Hypoxia: The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has class IV symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, which is likely exacerbated by his PFO closure.
5. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress.
6. Chronic pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of chronic pulmonary embolism, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress and pulmonary hypertension.
7. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a thrombocytosis, likely related to acute infection and post-operative state.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's worsening sputum and cough, fever, and WBC count increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Volume overload: The patient's poor response to diuretic therapy and longstanding volume overload may lead to further respiratory distress and worsening of his pulmonary hypertension.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's worsening renal function and potential need for further diuretic therapy may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytosis and anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and pulmonary hypertension may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.

To manage these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Treatment for HAP: The patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, and further cultures are being sent to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Diuresis: The patient is receiving diuretic therapy to manage volume overload and improve respiratory status.
3. Oxygen support: The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Anticoagulation therapy: The patient is receiving therapeutic lovenox to prevent thrombotic complications.
5. Cardiovascular management: The patient is receiving sildenafil and anticoagulation therapy to manage his pulmonary hypertension and prevent cardiac complications.
6. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain control measures to manage his post-operative pain.
7. Wound care: The patient is receiving daily dressing changes and wound care to manage his surgical incision.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve his respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient improved today. On 6L nasal
   cannula. Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably
   related to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology
   unclear which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible
   given fever, recent cessation in antibiotics, however no white count,
   has not continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor
   response to 80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP
   elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Continue lasix gtt.  Goal -500cc. Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Supratherapeutic INR currently. Hold Lovenox given worsening renal
   function. Monitor INR.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Surgery consult re: Abdominal Fluid Collection.
   - Vanc, Zosyn
 hold Cipro given elevated INR and QT prolongation.
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Hold Ciprofloxacin
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil. Supratherapeutic INR. Holding other
   anticoagulation for now. Consideration for increase in sildenafil vs.
   endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - Swan Catheter for eval of right heart function.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Hold lovenox currently supratherapeutic INR.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR.
   - Restart Coumadin sp RHC.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Daily dressing changes.
   - wound care
   - pain control.
   - abdominal US to check for collections; consider CT abdomen.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, PE, diastolic CHF, and PFO closure, admitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial injury. The patient's chest X-ray is pending, but the abdominal ultrasound revealed complex paramedian fluid collections at the superior aspect of the incisional scar, which may indicate chronic nature and superimposed infection.

The patient's respiratory status is poor, with bibasilar crackles and occasional wheeze in both lungs. The patient is on 6L nasal cannula oxygen support and is being treated with lasix, famotidine, and metolazone for fluid overload and respiratory distress.

The patient's cardiac status is also compromised, with a supratherapeutic INR and a history of atrial flutter. The patient is anticoagulated with lovenox, but it will be held due to worsening renal function. The patient's platelet count is thrombocytosis, likely related to acute infection and post-op status.

The patient's abdominal status is stable, with no significant change in pain and having bowel movements. The patient's wound is being managed with daily dressing changes and wound care.

The patient's diabetes status is well-controlled, and the patient is being managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is poor, and the patient may require mechanical ventilation to support breathing.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, and the patient may be at risk for cardiac arrest due to supratherapeutic INR and atrial flutter.
3. Infection: The patient's abdominal ultrasound revealed complex paramedian fluid collections, which may indicate chronic nature and superimposed infection.
4. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and the patient may be at risk for recurrent PE.
6. Sepsis: The patient's fever and respiratory distress may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's treatment with lasix and metolazone may lead to metabolic alkalosis, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

To manage these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and treatment with medications and interventions as needed."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and was readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Respiratory distress and hypoxia, which is likely related to his poor baseline respiratory status and possible pneumonia or fluid overload.
* Fever, which may be related to a recent 8-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
* Abdominal fluid collections, which may be infected, and a complex paramedian fluid collection on abdominal ultrasound.
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, indicating worsening renal function.
* Supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), which may be related to warfarin therapy.
* Prolonged QT interval, which may be related to ciprofloxacin therapy.
* Pulmonary hypertension, which is likely worsening due to his PFO closure.
* Atrial flutter, which may be related to his cardiac history and anticoagulation therapy.
* Thrombocytosis, which is likely related to acute infection and post-operative state.

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.2-9.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 91-91 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6-1.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 33-28.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* LDH: 203 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Ciprofloxacin (held due to prolonged QT interval)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Sildenafil
* Warfarin (held due to supratherapeutic INR)
* Lovenox (held due to worsening renal function)

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure
* Pneumonia
* Fluid overload
* Pulmonary embolism
* Diastolic congestive heart failure
* Atrial flutter
* Thrombocytosis
* Worsening renal function
* Supratherapeutic INR
* Prolonged QT interval

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing high-flow oxygen therapy
* Monitoring for respiratory distress and hypoxia
* Reassessing the patient's cardiac status and pulmonary hypertension
* Re-evaluating the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels
* Considering further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, to evaluate the patient's abdominal fluid collections and pulmonary embolism
* Continuing anticoagulation therapy, but adjusting the dosage and type of anticoagulant based on the patient's renal function and INR levels
* Monitoring the patient's platelet count and considering platelet transfusions if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures

   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.
   - Desaturated to 83% while sleeping last night. Was fine when woken.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic heart failure, and PFO closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and is now readmitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory status is poor, with bibasilar crackles and occasional wheeze bilaterally. His cardiac status is also poor, with a history of atrial flutter and prolonged QT interval.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.2-11.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.9-9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 91-104 x 10^9/L

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight. Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear which led to decompensation on
   the floor. Pneumonia possible given fever, recent cessation of
   antibiotics, however no white count, has not continued to spike. Fluid
   overload also possible given poor response to 80mg IV lasix on the
   floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Consider restart lovenox/heparin/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abdominal
   ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery has seen
   patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.  Influenza DFA
   negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn; hold cipro given elevated INR and QT
   prolongation (vancomycin re- ordered)
   - Continue hold ciprofloxacin as no source
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider hold lovenox; bridge with heparin pending decisions about
   right heart cath
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss regarding RHC
   - Given worsening renal function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above
   - Swan catheter for eval of right heart function
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Consider restart lovenox/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC)
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Restart coumadin s/p RHC
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight. Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear which led to decompensation on
   the floor. Pneumonia possible given fever, recent cessation of
   antibiotics, however no white count, has not continued to spike. Fluid
   overload also possible given poor response to 80mg IV lasix on the
   floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Consider restart lovenox/heparin/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abdominal
   ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery has seen
   patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.  Influenza DFA
   negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn; hold cipro given elevated INR and QT
   prolongation (vancomycin re- ordered)
   - Continue hold ciprofloxacin as no source
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider hold lovenox; bridge with heparin pending decisions about
   right heart cath
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss regarding RHC
   - Given worsening renal function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above
   - Swan catheter for eval of right heart function
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Consider restart lovenox/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC)
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Restart coumadin s/p RHC
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a complex medical history, including severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, diastolic heart failure, and PFO closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia, but was readmitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient continues to improve despite an episode of desaturation overnight. He has poor baseline respiratory status due to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic pulmonary embolism.
* Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely related to a recent 8-day course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient denies symptoms of aspiration, and abdominal ultrasound showed complex paramedian fluid collections, which are unlikely to be infected.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened over the past 2 days, likely due to increased lasix infusion and possible preload secondary to reduced volume.
* Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has elevated mean pulmonary artery pressures (mPAPs) and is likely in class IV symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes chronic thromboembolic disease, left-to-right shunting from the PFO, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and diastolic heart failure/left atrial overload.
* Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter and is currently anticoagulated.
* Prolonged QT: The patient's QT interval is prolonged, likely due to ciprofloxacin and possibly sotalol.
* Thrombocytosis: The patient has a thrombocytosis, which is likely related to acute infection and post-operative changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is poor, and he may require mechanical ventilation to support his oxygenation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and atrial flutter may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures may indicate a serious infection, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged QT interval and thrombocytosis may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor his respiratory, cardiac, and renal function, as well as his electrolyte levels and blood cultures. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be continued, and consideration should be given to restarting anticoagulation therapy. The patient's code status should be discussed with him and his family, and a plan for his disposition should be established."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension. He has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and atrial flutter, which was treated with cardioversion and sotalol dose reduction. He was diagnosed with chronic PEs and has been on heparin therapy.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory support: On 50-70% high flow mask, maintaining oxygenation.
* Cardiovascular: Sinus bradycardia, blood pressure 114/60 mmHg, heart rate 52 bpm.
* Renal function: Creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, urine output 3,135 mL in 24 hours.
* Fluid balance: Total input 2,387 mL, total output 3,535 mL, with a negative balance of -1,148 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC 11.2 K/uL
	+ Hct 27.3%
	+ Plt 91 K/uL
	+ Cr 1.0 mg/dL
	+ TropT <0.01 ng/mL
	+ TCO2 35 mmHg
	+ Glucose 58 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of chronic PEs and is at risk of developing new emboli.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter and pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of worsening renal function.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may lead to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections, given his prolonged ICU stay.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

The plan of care includes:

1. Continuing respiratory support with high-flow mask.
2. Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and adjusting therapy as needed.
3. Managing the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
4. Restarting heparin therapy when the INR is less than 2.
5. Continuing antibiotics for 8 days.
6. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting therapy as needed.
7. Providing stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis."

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, and fever. The patient has a complex medical history, including severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory distress with bibasilar crackles and occasional wheezing bilaterally
* Fever, which has been treated with vancomycin and zosyn, but has not responded
* Hypoxia, which is being managed with high-flow oxygen therapy
* Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), suggesting cardiac decompensation
* Worsening creatinine, likely related to increased lasix administration and possible preload secondary to reduced volume
* Thrombocytosis, likely related to acute infection and post-operative state
* Chronic PE, with supratherapeutic INR and need for anticoagulation
* Prolonged QT interval, likely secondary to ciprofloxacin and sotalol
* Type II diabetes, being managed with sliding scale insulin
* GERD, being managed with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia, given the patient's respiratory distress and fever
* Fluid overload, given the patient's poor response to lasix and possible preload secondary to reduced volume
* New PE, given the patient's history of chronic PE and worsening respiratory status
* Metabolic alkalosis, given the patient's chronic respiratory acidosis and possible overadministration of lasix
* Cardiac arrhythmias, given the patient's history of atrial flutter and prolonged QT interval
* Worsening renal function, given the patient's current creatinine levels and possible preload secondary to reduced volume
* Infection, given the patient's chronic PE and possible post-operative state

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue high-flow oxygen therapy to manage hypoxia
* Continue antibiotics for HAP and pneumonia
* Discontinue lasix gtt and re-assess urine output
* Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
* Continue heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending RHC/procedures
* Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
* Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow
* Consider induction of sputum culture to evaluate for recurrence of HAP
* Recheck C. diff if diarrhea persists

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement and discussion with case management regarding pulmonary rehab."

   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a complex medical history, including severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and is currently readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current medical condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which is likely related to his underlying pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic PE. The etiology of the decompensation is unclear, but pneumonia, fluid overload, and new PE are possible causes.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely related to his recent antibiotics course and underlying infection. However, the source of the infection is unclear, and further investigation is needed.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, likely related to increased lasix dosing and possible preload secondary to reduced volume.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is likely worsening, and he is experiencing class IV symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes chronic thromboembolic disease, L-to-R shunting from the PFO, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which was cardioverted at an outside hospital. He is currently anticoagulated and is experiencing recurrent atrial flutter with right ventricular overload when sotalol is decreased.
6. Prolonged QT: The patient's QT interval is prolonged, likely secondary to ciprofloxacin and sotalol.
7. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a thrombocytosis, likely related to acute infection and post-operative status.
8. Type II diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes, which is being managed with sliding scale insulin.
9. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient has GERD, which is being managed with a proton pump inhibitor.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with antibiotics and high-flow oxygen support.
2. Discontinuation of lasix and re-assessment of urine output.
3. Consideration of diamox for metabolic alkalosis.
4. Continue high-flow oxygen support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension.
5. Discussion of right heart catheterization (RHC) with the patient's family and medical team.
6. Monitoring of the patient's INR and initiation of heparin when it falls below 2.
7. Continued management of the patient's atrial flutter with anticoagulation and consideration of cardioversion.
8. Monitoring of the patient's QT interval and consideration of induction therapy for sputum culture.
9. Re-checking of C. difficile (C. diff) if diarrhea occurs.
10. Continued management of the patient's type II diabetes and GERD.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and a discussion with case management is needed regarding pulmonary rehabilitation."

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episodes of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Continue lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - No right heart catheterization at this time
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for a total of eight days
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Follow sputum culture; consider induction given concern for
   recurrence if can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Stable to mild improvement. Likely initially related with lasix
   gtt, possible preload component [**2-4**] volume.
   - Continue lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - No right heart catheterization at this time
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   .
   # Anemia. Hct slightly decreasing. Uncertain anemia chronic disease
   versus other etiologies.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.
   .

   possible procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, coumadin
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: Patient, patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF, and PFO closure.
* He is currently admitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress, which is likely related to pneumonia, fluid overload, or a new PE.
* He has a prolonged QT interval, atrial flutter, and thrombocytosis.
* He is receiving treatment for HAP, including antibiotics and lasix, and is being closely monitored for signs of sepsis.
* He has a history of strangulated hernia repair and is currently experiencing abdominal wall edema and serosanguinous drainage.
* He has a type II DM and is being managed with a sliding scale.
* He has a history of GERD and is receiving PPI therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress suggest that pneumonia is a possibility. If left untreated, pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
* Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is out of control, and he is at risk of developing fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory distress, cardiac failure, and death.
* New PE: The patient's history of PE and his current symptoms suggest that he may be at risk of developing a new PE. If left untreated, a new PE can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and death.
* Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is a potential complication of his cardiac condition, and it can lead to arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and death if left untreated.
* Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis is a potential complication of his infection and may increase his risk of bleeding.
* Prolonged QT interval: The patient's prolonged QT interval is a potential complication of his medication and may increase his risk of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

To address these potential complications, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage his fluid balance and electrolytes to prevent fluid overload.
* Continue to monitor his cardiac status and adjust his medication as needed to prevent arrhythmias.
* Continue to monitor his platelet count and adjust his medication as needed to prevent bleeding.
* Consider performing a right heart catheterization to assess his pulmonary hypertension and determine the best course of treatment.
* Consider performing a CT scan to rule out a new PE.
* Consider adjusting his antibiotic therapy to address any potential infections.
* Continue to monitor his electrolyte levels and adjust his medication as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
* Consider performing a stress test to assess his cardiac function and determine the best course of treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.
