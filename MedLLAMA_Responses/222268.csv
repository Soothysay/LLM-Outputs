   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established.
   - Enoxaparin 70mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis.
   - Hold diuretics
   - Uptitrate beta-blockers as tolerated by blood pressure
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea, vomitting resolved
   and patient taking POs
   - Hold off on IV fluids for now, but can consider 250cc boluses if
   urine output decreases.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort and was treated with beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine for recurrent episodes of chest pain. The patient has declined cardiac catheterization. She has mild pancreatitis and gastritis, and her creatinine clearance is <30. The patient is currently on anticoagulation therapy, and her troponin levels are elevated. She has chronic systolic CHF, chronic renal failure, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may exacerbate hypovolemia, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
	* Elevated troponin levels may indicate NSTEMI or demand ischemia, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
2. Renal Complications:
	* The patient's creatinine clearance is <30, increasing the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and further compromising renal function.
	* The patient is already experiencing chronic renal failure, which may worsen with continued anticoagulation therapy.
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may exacerbate hypovolemia, leading to decreased lung compliance and increased risk of respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* The patient's mild pancreatitis and gastritis may worsen, leading to further gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or abscesses.
5. Skin Breakdown Complications:
	* The patient's skin breakdown may worsen, leading to further skin compromise, infection, or sepsis.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her cardiac, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skin complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg SC q24h for
   creatinine clearance < 30
   - cont lovenox as enzymes are trending up
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis. Uptitrated beta blockers yesterday.
   - Hold diuretics
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea, vomitting resolved
   and patient taking POs
   - Hold off on IV fluids for now, but can consider 250cc boluses if
   urine output decreases.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and mild pancreatitis. She presented with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient has experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, including one episode with ST segment deviations that resolved after treatment with beta blockade and nitroglycerin. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but the cause is unclear, and it may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.

The patient has been started on anticoagulation with lovenox, and her medication regimen includes ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and her blood pressure is controlled with beta blockers.

The patient has mild pancreatitis, as evidenced by slightly elevated lipase and amylase levels, and has been advised to hold diuretics and consider uptitration of beta blockers as tolerated. Her chronic systolic CHF is stable, and she has not shown any signs of worsening heart failure.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and her creatinine clearance is less than 30. She has been started on therapeutic enoxaparin, and her code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's mild pancreatitis can worsen and lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscesses, or sepsis.
3. Renal complications: The patient's chronic renal failure can worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's coccygeal breakdown can worsen, leading to skin ulcers, infections, or sepsis.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastritis and mild pancreatitis can worsen, leading to complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state can increase her risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and mild pancreatitis. She presented with chest pain, which was initially attributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's chest pain episodes were managed with beta blockade, nitro, and morphine, with relief of symptoms.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support is via nasal cannula with 100% oxygen. Her physical examination is notable for a hyperdynamic precordium, irregular heart rhythm, and clear breath sounds.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI. The patient's creatinine clearance is less than 30, and she is receiving anticoagulation with Lovenox.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Chest pain: likely related to atrial fibrillation with RVR, with some contribution from old infarcts.
* Rhythm: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may be exacerbated by hypovolemia.
* Nausea/vomiting: likely related to mild pancreatitis, with elevated lipase and amylase levels.
* Chronic systolic CHF: patient is stable, with no change in dyspnea or leg edema.
* Chronic renal failure: patient's creatinine clearance is less than 30, and she is receiving anticoagulation with Lovenox.
* Skin breakdown: patient has a coccygeal breakdown, which is being managed conservatively.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can worsen the patient's condition.
* Cardiac failure, which can lead to worsening dyspnea, edema, and decreased cardiac output.
* Pancreatitis, which can progress to severe pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, or even death.
* Renal failure, which can worsen the patient's chronic renal failure and increase the risk of complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
* Skin breakdown, which can lead to infection, sepsis, and further complications.

The patient's plan includes continued anticoagulation with Lovenox, beta blockers, and diuretics, as well as close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and mild pancreatitis, presenting with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has had multiple episodes of chest pain, with one episode occurring in the context of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which improved with beta blockade and nitro. Repeat EKGs demonstrated no evidence of ST elevations but some ST-T wave changes were seen on admission. Enzymes are trending up. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and has been started on anticoagulation with lovenox. She has also been started on metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may exacerbate her cardiac condition, leading to further ischemia and acute systolic and diastolic heart failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's mild pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown may worsen, leading to further complications such as infection, sepsis, and death.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox to prevent further thrombotic complications.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including her heart rate, blood pressure, and EKG changes.
3. Consider further interventions such as cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention to address the patient's coronary artery disease.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pancreatitis with supportive care and antibiotics as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's nausea and vomiting closely, and consider further interventions such as anti-emetics or nasogastric suctioning.
6. Monitor the patient's skin breakdown closely, and consider further interventions such as wound care or antibiotics as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and consider further interventions such as oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, and consider further interventions such as dialysis or hemofiltration as needed."

   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV.
   Troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial
   fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is
   stable near 400, which was the same level during her last admission.
   Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation until more definitive trend
   for troponins can be established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg
   SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Given hypotension could only tolerate Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Have discussed treatment options with pt
   - Consider rinolazone
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis. Uptitrated beta blockers yesterday.
   - restart diuretic
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She presents with chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting.

The patient's current medication regimen includes metoprolol 50mg PO BID (home dose), Imdur for CP prophylaxis, Lovenox 80mg daily, and Furosemide (Lasix). She has refused cardiac catheterization and is being managed with NTG drip and MS IV for hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 86 bpm (69-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/49 mmHg (56-137/104 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 inspirations per minute (12-25 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with RVR

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Troponin elevation: 0.36 ng/mL (0.58-0.59 ng/mL)
* Creatinine clearance: < 30 mL/min
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 216 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.6 K/uL
* Sodium: 135 mmol/L
* Potassium: 5.3 mmol/L
* Chloride: 102 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 26.0 mmol/L

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue anticoagulation with Lovenox
* Continue ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin
* Consider uptitration of beta blockers as tolerated
* Restart diuretic
* Continue digoxin
* Continue lisinopril and beta blockers for chronic systolic CHF
* Diruesis with goal I/O negative -500 cc per day
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: worsening of atrial fibrillation, RVR, and CHF
* Renal complications: worsening of chronic renal failure
* Respiratory complications: pneumonia, respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal complications: worsening of gastritis and pancreatitis
* Skin complications: worsening of skin breakdown and decubitus ulcers
* Infection complications: sepsis, wound infection

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent these complications."

   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been experiencing chest discomfort, which has been treated with various medications, including metoprolol, Imdur, and NTG.

The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal limits, except for borderline blood pressure. She has been receiving diuretic therapy to reduce preload, afterload, and wall stress, and has been started on Lovenox for anticoagulation.

The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and atorvastatin, and has also refused wound care for a sacral decubitus ulcer. She has been advised to follow a low-sodium heart-healthy diet and has been prescribed medications for chronic systolic heart failure, including lisinopril, digoxin, and metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leading to further cardiac decompensation.
2. Development of pulmonary edema due to increased preload and afterload.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy.
4. Progression of sacral decubitus ulcer, leading to infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Development of respiratory failure due to increased lung water and decreased lung compliance.
6. Increased risk of cardiac arrest due to tachyarrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
7. Decreased renal function due to decreased perfusion pressure and increased sodium retention.
8. Increased risk of infection due to decreased immune function and prolonged hospital stay.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and bleeding. Her medications should be adjusted as needed to optimize her cardiac function and reduce her risk of complications. Additionally, her sacral decubitus ulcer should be managed aggressively to prevent infection and promote healing."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Recurrent episodes of chest pain, some of which are atypical for usual
   ischemic pain.
   Physical Examination
   HR 120s.
   JVP >16 with prominent v wave
   AS and TR murmurs
   Medical Decision Making
   Improving. Rate control remains an issue as does borderline hypotension
   Will increase metoprolol to 25 mg tid; Continue oral nitrates together
   with other heart failure regimen as recorded above.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload

   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Recurrent episodes of chest pain, some of which are atypical for usual
   ischemic pain.
   Physical Examination
   HR 120s.
   JVP >16 with prominent v wave
   AS and TR murmurs
   Medical Decision Making
   Improving. Rate control remains an issue as does borderline hypotension
   Will increase metoprolol to 25 mg tid; Continue oral nitrates together
   with other heart failure regimen as recorded above.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort and is experiencing worsening chest pain. Her blood pressure is borderline, and she is intolerant to beta blockers. She has been started on metoprolol 50mg PO BID, Imdur for prophylaxis, and Lovenox 80mg daily for anticoagulation. She is also receiving morphine prn for chest pain.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Pulse: 86 bpm
* Blood pressure: 92/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Elderly, overweight female, pleasant, and normoactive
* HEENT: MMM, OP clear
* Neck: Supple with JVP of 18cm
* Cardiac: PMI diffuse, + RV Heave, LUSB mid-peaking systolic murmur, and holosystolic murmur at Apex
* Lungs: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis; resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use; CTAB, no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi
* Abdomen: Soft, obese, NT, ND; no HSM or tenderness; Abd aorta not enlarged by palpation; no abdominial bruits
* Extremities: 2+ peripheral edema, stable
* Skin: Stage II Sacral decubitus noted on admission
* Pulses: Right DP 2+ PT 2+, Left DP 2+ PT 2+

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* WBC: 6.6-7.9 K/uL
* Hct: 26.3-26.0%
* Plt: 216-173 K/uL
* Cr: 1.5-2.1 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.36-0.59 ng/mL
* Glucose: 94-98 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Rate control: uptitrate beta blockers as above
* Diuresis: goal I/O negative -500 cc per day
* Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
* Continue lisinopril, BB
* Continue imdur
* Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of end-stage CAD

Potential medical complications:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Hypotension due to beta blocker intolerance
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation
* Skin breakdown due to sacral decubitus ulcer
* Respiratory failure due to chronic systolic heart failure
* Infection due to indwelling catheters
* VAP due to respiratory support
* DVT due to immobility"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV.
   Troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial
   fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is
   stable near 400, which was the same level during her last admission.
   Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation until more definitive trend
   for troponins can be established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg
   SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Given hypotension could only tolerate Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Have discussed treatment options with pt
   - Consider rinolazone
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis. Uptitrated beta blockers yesterday.
   - restart diuretic
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Seems resolved

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 71-year-old female, is being treated for severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She presented with chest discomfort and was initially treated with beta blockers, but her blood pressure was not high enough to tolerate this. She responded well to NTG drip and MS IV.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin levels, which may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR or NSTEMI
* Stable CPK levels near 400, suggesting a former NSTEMI
* Elevated lipase and amylase levels, suggesting mild pancreatitis
* Elevated JVP, which may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation
* Chronic renal failure
* Stage II sacral decubitus ulcer

The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and is being treated with anticoagulation, beta blockers, and diuretics. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition and treatment include:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation with RVR, leading to further cardiac complications
* Development of heart failure or pulmonary edema
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Progression of chronic renal failure
* Development of skin breakdown or infection
* Pancreatitis or worsening of gastritis
* Respiratory complications due to atrial fibrillation with RVR or underlying chronic lung disease

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, nitrates, and diuretics, but has not tolerated them well due to hypotension. She has also been prescribed anticoagulation therapy and has refused cardiac catheterization.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction, but the CPK levels are stable, suggesting that the elevation may be related to demand rather than NSTEMI. The patient's creatinine clearance is less than 30, and she has been prescribed lovenox.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous infarcts. She has a history of skin breakdown and has refused wound care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest that she may be at risk for myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increase her risk for heart failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and death.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's history of skin breakdown and refusal of wound care increase her risk for further skin breakdown and potential infection.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of skin breakdown increase her risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and death.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases her risk for bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhage and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and heart failure increase her risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine clearance less than 30 and history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increase her risk for renal failure, which can lead to uremia and death.

Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continued frequent angina
   Physical Examination
   BP 90s; HR 90-100
   Marked JVP elevation with prominent v wave.
   Medical Decision Making
   Difficulty controlling rate due to hypotension.
   creatinine elevation in setting of diuresis and ACE inhibitor - on hold
   and anemia.
   She continues to refuse cardiac cath.
   Will begin around the clock narcotic analgesics.
   Consider ranolazine.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - Trial of ranolazine today, monitor QTc.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.

   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continued frequent angina
   Physical Examination
   BP 90s; HR 90-100
   Marked JVP elevation with prominent v wave.
   Medical Decision Making
   Difficulty controlling rate due to hypotension.
   creatinine elevation in setting of diuresis and ACE inhibitor - on hold
   and anemia.
   She continues to refuse cardiac cath.
   Will begin around the clock narcotic analgesics.
   Consider ranolazine.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, which is not responding to treatment with Zofran. The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and Lisinopril has been discontinued. She is currently on Lasix, but it is not providing adequate urine output. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and the rapid ventricular response may lead to further cardiac complications.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient's urine output is low, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and further compromise her cardiac function.
3. Increased creatinine levels: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, which may indicate kidney damage or decreased kidney function.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can further exacerbate her cardiac condition.
5. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain is not well-controlled, and the underlying cause is unclear. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to her fatigue and shortness of breath, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient has stage II sacral decubitus, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
8. Potential for cardiac catheterization refusal: The patient has refused cardiac catheterization, which may limit her treatment options and increase her risk of cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize the patient's atrial fibrillation control, including rate control and rhythm control.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output closely and adjust diuretic therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
4. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's nausea and vomiting.
5. Continue to manage the patient's chest pain and consider further evaluation and treatment.
6. Consider transfusing the patient with PRBCs to improve her anemia.
7. Continue to manage the patient's skin breakdown and consider further evaluation and treatment.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment options for the patient's cardiac condition, including cardiac catheterization, if she is willing to consider it."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - Trial of ranolazine today, monitor QTc.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
   # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
   # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.
   FEN:  Low-sodium heart healthy diet

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
* She has been experiencing chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, which have been managed with anti-emetic medications and morphine.
* The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a palliative approach.
* She has been started on lovenox for anticoagulation, but has refused long-term anticoagulation.
* The patient has developed peripheral edema, and her creatinine has increased, prompting the discontinuation of lisinopril.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:** Given the patient's severe coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
2. **Renal Complications:** The patient's creatinine level has increased, and her eGFR is less than 30. This may lead to further worsening of renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications such as aspiration pneumonia.
4. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory status.
5. **Infection Complications:** The patient's peripheral edema and skin breakdown increase the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of impaired circulation and immune function.
6. **Anemia Complications:** The patient's persistent low Hct may lead to worsening anemia, which can further exacerbate her cardiac and respiratory symptoms.
7. **Chest Pain Complications:** The patient's ongoing chest pain may lead to further cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

In light of these potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely, adjusting her medications and treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting, despite receiving Zofran. The patient's creatinine has increased, and Lisinopril was discontinued. Lasix was started, but the patient's urine output has been minimal, requiring a 250cc bolus twice overnight. The patient's heart rate is 92 bpm, and blood pressure is 102/51 mmHg. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and their oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient has a history of allergies to Flexeril, Percocet, and Compazine. They have received antibiotics and are currently receiving morphine for chest pain. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted nausea and vomiting.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. The patient's creatinine level has increased, and their potassium level is slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Dehydration due to minimal urine output and fluid losses.
2. Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure, given the patient's elevated troponin-T levels and atrial fibrillation.
3. Renal failure or worsening of renal function due to decreased urine output and increased creatinine levels.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, given the patient's atrial fibrillation and possible cardiac damage.
5. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to the patient's nausea and vomiting.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, given the patient's elevated potassium level.
7. Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and respiratory support.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload

   ischemia and CP.  Goal 500-1L negative. Will resume home dose lasix of
   40mg PO daily.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort, which was initially treated with beta blockers but was limited by hypotension. The patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and chest pain, and has refused certain medications such as lisinopril and atorvastatin. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination reveals a soft, obese abdomen, 2+ peripheral edema, and a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may lead to pulmonary congestion and respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine clearance is < 30, which may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. This may lead to further decline in renal function and require dialysis.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may indicate gastrointestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, or other gastrointestinal complications.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's stage II sacral decubitus ulcer may worsen if not properly treated, leading to further tissue damage and potential infection.
6. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's low-molecular-weight heparin therapy may not be sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and chronic medical conditions may increase her risk of infection, which could be life-threatening.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status may exacerbate her underlying medical conditions and increase her risk of complications.
9. Medication-related complications: The patient's refusal of certain medications, such as lisinopril and atorvastatin, may lead to inadequate treatment of her underlying conditions, which could worsen her condition.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.
    FEN:  Low-sodium heart healthy diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Therapeutic enoxaparin for now, switch to heparin SC
   tomorrow.
   CODE: DNR/DNI, follow up palliative care reccomendations

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress

   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.

    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort and was treated with nitrates, morphine, and beta blockers. Her troponin levels are elevated, but the cause is uncertain. She has been started on anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin, but has refused long-term anticoagulation. She has also been prescribed statins, aspirin, and a low-sodium diet. The patient's condition is being managed with a focus on rate control, diuresis, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and the presence of atrial fibrillation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may persist or worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's systolic congestive heart failure may worsen due to her underlying cardiac condition and the use of diuretics.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her immunosuppressed state and the presence of indwelling catheters.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown may worsen due to her underlying medical condition and the use of pressure-reducing devices.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her ongoing bleeding and the lack of adequate iron replacement therapy.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop respiratory failure due to her underlying cardiac condition and the use of sedatives.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may develop gastrointestinal bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and the presence of atrial fibrillation.
9. Renal failure: The patient may develop renal failure due to her underlying cardiac condition and the use of diuretics.
10. Mortality: The patient's mortality risk is high due to her underlying medical condition and the presence of multiple comorbidities."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort and was treated with NTG drip and MS IV, but her condition was limited by hypotension. The patient has been started on lovenox for anticoagulation and has been prescribed MS Contin for pain management.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 67 bpm (64-95 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 81/39 mmHg (50-135/91 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Troponin: 0.36 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.1 ng/mL)
* Creatine kinase (CK): 372 IU/L (normal range: 25-170 IU/L)
* Creatine kinase-MB (CKMB): 15 IU/L (normal range: 0-5 IU/L)
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 13 IU/L (normal range: 7-56 IU/L)
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 29 IU/L (normal range: 8-48 IU/L)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* No acute distress
* Awake and alert
* Pleasant
* Hyperdynamic PMI
* Irregularly irregular heart rhythm
* 4/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border
* Blowing holosystolic murmur at the apex

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Severe coronary artery disease
* Systolic CHF
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Anemia
* Skin breakdown

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
* Cardiac failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema, hypotension, and even death
* Renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even death
* Anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased cardiac output
* Skin breakdown, which can lead to infection, sepsis, and even death
* Respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and even death

Given the patient's advanced age and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to prioritize her comfort and quality of life. The patient's refusal of cardiac catheterization and her preference for a palliative approach suggest that she is focused on symptom management rather than curative treatment. The patient's healthcare team should continue to work closely with her to manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort and has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 81/39 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her neurological status is also stable, with no focal deficits or abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction. Her creatinine clearance is low, and she has been started on lovenox for anticoagulation. Her electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypernatremia.

The patient's medical history is significant for severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She has a history of previous cardiac events, including a myocardial infarction and cardiac catheterization.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may continue to be a problem, and she may require further rate control measures.
2. Heart failure: The patient's systolic congestive heart failure may worsen, leading to increased fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate ongoing myocardial infarction, which may require further treatment.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's low creatinine clearance may worsen, leading to further kidney dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines may increase her risk of infection.
6. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown may worsen, leading to further complications and potential infections.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue beta blockers to control heart rate and blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including frequent echocardiograms and cardiac enzymes.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy with lovenox and consider switching to heparin SC if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and electrolyte levels closely, and adjust medications as necessary.
5. Continue wound care and skin management to prevent further skin breakdown.
6. Consider further treatment options, such as cardiac catheterization or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), to manage the patient's cardiac condition.
7. Provide supportive care, including pain management and symptom control, to improve the patient's quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.
    FEN:  Low-sodium heart healthy diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:  heparin SC, PPI, bowel regimen

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort and was initially treated with beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine. Due to hypotension, the beta blockers were discontinued, and the patient was started on morphine sulfate and lovenox. She has been experiencing chest pain, nausea, and vomiting, but her pain and nausea have been well-controlled with morphine sulfate and breakthrough pain medications. Her appetite has improved, and she is willing to take bowel medications and heparin injections.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and skin breakdown. She has been treated with blood transfusions, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, but her creatinine level has remained elevated. She has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a palliative approach. The patient has been started on morphine sulfate and lovenox, and her pain and nausea have been well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may lead to further decline in kidney function, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
4. Skin Breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown may lead to infection, sepsis, and potential amputation.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or exacerbation of COPD.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may lead to infection, sepsis, or septic shock.
8. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and recent cardiac event may lead to thromboembolic complications such as pulmonary embolism or stroke.
9. Medication Side Effects: The patient's medications, such as morphine sulfate and lovenox, may have side effects such as respiratory depression, hypotension, or bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
