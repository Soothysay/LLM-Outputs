You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a massive GI bleed. He presented with chest pain and was transferred for further management of a STEMI. Current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 80/49 mmHg. He has atrial fibrillation and is receiving heparin sodium infusion. His physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, trace, and left lower extremity edema, trace. He has a history of anemia, osteoarthritis, and sacral and foot decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to RV failure, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of BP and IVF administration is necessary.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 6.7, which may be related to renal failure. Close monitoring of K levels and EKG changes is necessary.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap is elevated, which may be due to uremia, lactate, or salicylates. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia, which may require transfusion. Monitoring of HCT levels is necessary.
5. Pulmonary embolism/DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but close monitoring for DVT is necessary.
6. Osteoarthritis: The patient has a history of osteoarthritis, which may require pain management and consideration for joint replacement.
7. Sacral and foot decubitus ulcers: The patient has a history of decubitus ulcers, which require close monitoring and consideration for wound care consult.
8. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient has a STEMI, which requires close monitoring and consideration for cardiac catheterization.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
10. Infection: The patient's immune status is compromised, which makes him susceptible to infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Administer IVF as needed to increase preload and maintain blood pressure.
3. Monitor the patient's potassium levels and EKG changes closely.
4. Investigate the cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis and consider treatment.
5. Consider transfusion for anemia.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider pain management for osteoarthritis.
8. Monitor the patient's sacral and foot decubitus ulcers closely and consider wound care consult.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardiac catheterization.
10. Consider antibiotics if signs of infection develop."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a previous pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI, likely inferior region. The patient is currently being managed medically due to his age and poor baseline functionality. He is experiencing hypotension, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, anemia, and is at risk for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to RV failure or LV dysfunction
	* Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, may worsen due to electrolyte imbalances
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema
	* Pneumonia or aspiration due to altered mental status and poor oral care
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, or sepsis
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbation due to underlying conditions
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to chronic iron deficiency anemia or underlying conditions
	* Acute pancreatitis or cholecystitis due to hyperkalemia or electrolyte imbalances
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral edema or infarction due to hypoxia, hypoperfusion, or cardiac complications
	* Seizures or altered mental status due to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects
6. Infections:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infections
	* Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) due to central lines or peripheral lines
7. Decubitus Ulcer Complications:
	* Infection or cellulitis due to poor wound care or compromised immune system
	* Septic shock or organ failure due to untreated decubitus ulcers

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Neither family nor patient desire cardiac catheterizaiton. Will manage
   medically.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a massive gastrointestinal bleed. He presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). 

The patient has been diagnosed with the following conditions:

1. STEMI: The patient has positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with a STEMI, likely in the inferior region. He will be managed medically, and not taken for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure in the setting of inferior MI. It may also be due to hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, likely due to poor perfusion caused by congestive heart failure (CHF) after STEMI.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a potassium level of 6.7, which may be related to renal failure or acid shifts in the setting of lactic acidosis.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia, and has been transfused 1 unit of red blood cells.
6. Pulmonary embolism/DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but is not on coumadin due to a history of gastrointestinal bleed.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient has been restarted on oxycodone with PRN doses.
8. Sacral and foot decubitus ulcers: The patient has sacral and foot decubitus ulcers, and would benefit from a care consult.
9. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin and PPI for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) and hyperkalemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's STEMI and hypotension may lead to cardiac failure, which could worsen his condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient's hyperkalemia and anion gap metabolic acidosis may indicate renal failure, which could worsen his condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's sacral and foot decubitus ulcers may increase the risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Poor wound healing: The patient's anemia and malnutrition may impair wound healing, making it more difficult to treat his decubitus ulcers.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the CCU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has a history of acute coronary syndrome, acute renal failure, and decubitus ulcer. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 91/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, indicating acute kidney injury. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease, and he may require dialysis.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. Wound complications: The patient's decubitus ulcer may become infected or worsen, leading to further complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive lines and devices increase his risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's use of diuretics and electrolyte-rich medications may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to eat and his use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to nutritional deficiencies and complications, such as malnutrition and liver dysfunction."

   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular

   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10860**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2197-4-21**] 13:31 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Worsening of cardiogenic shock: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is a risk of further deterioration of cardiac function, leading to cardiac arrest or multi-organ failure.
2. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and there is a risk of further deterioration of renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration of acid-base balance, leading to metabolic acidosis or respiratory acidosis.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or respiratory failure.
5. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has sacral and foot decubitus ulcers, which can lead to further skin breakdown, infection, and sepsis.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of developing pneumonia, particularly in the setting of cardiogenic shock and respiratory acidosis.
7. Pulmonary embolism/DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but there is still a risk of developing pulmonary embolism or DVT, particularly in the setting of immobility and poor perfusion.
8. Osteoarthritis: The patient has a history of osteoarthritis, and there is a risk of further deterioration, leading to increased pain and disability.
9. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is a risk of further deterioration, leading to organ failure or cardiac arrest.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent these potential complications and improve outcomes."

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2197-4-21**]:
   1. Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes. Probable
   bilateral
   pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
   2. Opacity overlying the mid lower chest may represent a hiatal hernia
   or a tortuous-dilated aorta. PA and lateral view of the chest may be
   helpful in
   further evaluation.
   3. Prominence of the azygos vein.
   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   Microbiology: None

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically. Lipids
   well controlled.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt would recommend stopping tomorrow (after 48
   hours)
   - Reduce atorvastatin from 80mg to 20 mg daily given LFT abnormalities
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening multi-organ dysfunction
   with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increasing the rate with inotropic agents as
   this would exacerbate patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock. Likely the driving force behind the
   hyperkalemia.
   - Optimize hemodynamics to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue
   perfusion
   - Renal consult to maintain electrolytes, doubtful that hemodialysis
   would be medically feasible but renal can also decide if medically
   feasible, would appreciate their input
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemi a
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure verus acid shifts in
   setting of lactic acidosis.  K 6.7 on admission and peaked t waves on
   ekg in lateral leads.
   - calcium gluconate
   - Insulin/glucose
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs this am.
   - pantoprazole iv
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   - currently on heparin gtt for STEMI
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: restart oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower than
   pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic compromise)  will
   titrate up PRN
   .
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   .
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt, PPI
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: full, discussed with family. They understand that he has a poor
   prognosis but pt wants full code after seeing his brother die [**Name (NI) 303**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically. Lipids
   well controlled.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt would recommend stopping tomorrow (after 48
   hours)
   - Reduce atorvastatin from 80mg to 20 mg daily given LFT abnormalities
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening multi-organ dysfunction
   with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increasing the rate with inotropic agents as
   this would exacerbate patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock. Likely the driving force behind the
   hyperkalemia.
   - Optimize hemodynamics to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue
   perfusion
   - Renal consult to maintain electrolytes, doubtful that hemodialysis
   would be medically feasible but renal can also decide if medically
   feasible, would appreciate their input
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemi a
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend

   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure verus acid shifts in
   setting of lactic acidosis.  K 6.7 on admission and peaked t waves on
   ekg in lateral leads.
   - calcium gluconate
   - Insulin/glucose
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a massive gastrointestinal bleed, who presented to the hospital with chest pain and is being managed for a suspected STEMI. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic severe hip pain, anemia, and osteoarthritis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction, which is likely contributing to his hypotension and oliguric renal failure.
* Respiratory: The patient has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's mean arterial pressure is in the low 50s, and he has received multiple fluid boluses to maintain his blood pressure.
* Renal: The patient has acute oliguric renal failure, which is likely secondary to hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock.
* Electrolytes: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is being managed with insulin, glucose, and Kayexalate.
* Metabolic: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is being managed with insulin and glucose.
* Infection: The patient has a suspected pulmonary embolism/DVT, which is being managed with heparin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac: The patient's severe diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular systolic dysfunction may lead to further decompensation, including cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.
* Renal: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
* Respiratory: The patient's respiratory rate may increase if his oxygen saturation decreases or if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
* Electrolytes: The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or arrest if not managed properly.
* Infection: The patient's suspected pulmonary embolism/DVT may lead to further complications, including sepsis and organ failure.

The patient's code status is full code, and his family has been informed of his poor prognosis. The patient's disposition is CCU, and he will continue to receive ICU care and monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2197-4-21**]:
   1. Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes. Probable
   bilateral
   pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
   2. Opacity overlying the mid lower chest may represent a hiatal hernia
   or a tortuous-dilated aorta. PA and lateral view of the chest may be
   helpful in
   further evaluation.
   3. Prominence of the azygos vein.
   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt would recommend stopping tomorrow (after 48
   hours)
   - check lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening organ dysfunction with
   worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increase the rate as this would exacerbate
   patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure verus acid shifts in
   setting of lactic acidosis.  K 6.7 on admission and peaked t waves on
   ekg in lateral leads.
   - calcium gluconate
   - repeat kayexalate
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs this am.
   - pantoprazole iv
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   - currently on heparin gtt for STEMI
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: restart oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower than
   pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic compromise)  will
   titrate up PRN
   .
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   .
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt, PPI
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: full, discussed with family. They understand that he has a poor
   prognosis but pt wants full code after seeing his brother die [**Name (NI) 303**]

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old nursing home resident, presented to the hospital with chest pain and was diagnosed with STEMI. He has a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a massive GI bleed. The patient is currently being managed medically for STEMI, with a focus on pain control, hypertension, and cardiac dysfunction. He is also experiencing renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, anemia, and potential pulmonary embolism/DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac tamponade due to severe diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
	* Cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular dysfunction.
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and potential pulmonary embolism.
	* Respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or pneumonia.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, and/or sepsis.
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbation due to hypertension and/or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
4. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, acidosis, and/or medications.
	* Hypocalcemia due to hyperkalemia and/or medications.
	* Metabolic acidosis due to anion gap metabolic acidosis and/or lactic acidosis.
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infections.
	* Bacteremia due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infections.
6. Bleeding Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to hypertensive crisis and/or anticoagulation therapy.
	* Hemorrhagic stroke due to hypertension and/or anticoagulation therapy.
7. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke due to cardiogenic shock, hypoxia, and/or hypertension.
	* Seizures due to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and/or medications.
8. Other Complications:
	* Decubitus ulcers due to immobility and/or poor perfusion.
	* Pressure sores due to immobility and/or poor perfusion.
	* Pneumonia due to aspiration and/or immobility.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   full code; she is aware that rapid deterioration could occur suddenly.
   - Renal consulted - likely not candidate for HD, asked for urine lytes,
   they (Such) spoke to HCP and helped arrange family meeting. They
   recommend following K, but otherwise holding off on placement of line
   and HD until tomorrow.
   - Family meeting will be at 5 p.m. on Saturday (sorry - only time
   possible for HCP)
   - Was made DNR/DNI after extensive discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] about what
   full code would mean. The gravity of his illness was made clear. He
   said that he might like to go home, but this will depend on meeting.

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2197-4-21**]:
   1. Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes. Probable
   bilateral
   pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
   2. Opacity overlying the mid lower chest may represent a hiatal hernia
   or a tortuous-dilated aorta. PA and lateral view of the chest may be
   helpful in
   further evaluation.
   3. Prominence of the azygos vein.
   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically. Lipids
   well controlled.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - stop hep gtt
   - Continue atorvastatin 20 mg daily given LFT abnormalities
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening multi-organ dysfunction
   with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increasing the rate with inotropic agents as
   this would exacerbate patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN. Likely
   the driving force behind the hyperkalemia.
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   - family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus CMO
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin
   - calcium gluconate
   - Insulin/glucose
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs yesterday.
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   - stop heparin gtt for STEMI today
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower
   than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic compromise)
   will titrate up PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident
   with a history of HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter,
   massive GI bleed who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and
   is transferred for further management of STEMI.
   24 Hour Events:
   - gave 500 cc bolus for low uop and BP (sbp 80s)
   - spoke with patient's [**Hospital1 69**]: on [**2197-3-30**], SCr was 1.2 and BUN 46
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs
   - six units insulin, two amps glucose and Kayexalate for elevated K
   - echo showing severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   - additional 500 cc fluid bolus at 8PM for MAPs in low 50s
   - spoke with HCP, [**Name (NI) 332**] [**Name (NI) 11956**] [[**Telephone/Fax (1) 11957**], [**Numeric Identifier 11958**](c)] to
   review clinical situation. She confirmed patient expressed wish to be
   full code; she is aware that rapid deterioration could occur suddenly.
   - Renal consulted - likely not candidate for HD, asked for urine lytes,
   they (Such) spoke to HCP and helped arrange family meeting. They
   recommend following K, but otherwise holding off on placement of line
   and HD until tomorrow.
   - Family meeting will be at 5 p.m. on Saturday (sorry - only time
   possible for HCP)
   - Was made DNR/DNI after extensive discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] about what
   full code would mean. The gravity of his illness was made clear. He
   said that he might like to go home, but this will depend on meeting.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary embolism with an IVC filter, who presented to the hospital with chest pain and is being managed for a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient's current condition is critical, with severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle and associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction, leading to cardiogenic shock and oliguric renal failure. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyperkalemia, and the patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's medication regimen includes aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole, and the patient is being managed with IV fluids, phenylephrine, and insulin/glucose to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating poor perfusion due to cardiogenic shock, and the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely related to the STEMI.

The patient's anemia is chronic and iron deficiency, and the patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's pulmonary embolism/DVT is being managed with an IVC filter and heparin, and the patient's osteoarthritis is being managed with oxycodone.

The patient's goals of care have changed from full code to DNR/DNI, and a family meeting is scheduled for today to discuss hemodialysis versus continuous renal replacement therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure progression and need for dialysis.
4. Infection due to indwelling catheters and decubitus ulcers.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Thrombocytopenia due to anticoagulation therapy.
7. Anemia progression and need for transfusions.
8. Pulmonary embolism/DVT progression and need for anticoagulation therapy.
9. Osteoarthritis exacerbation due to immobility and weight loss.
10. Decubitus ulcer progression and need for wound care.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing the cardiogenic shock, optimizing hemodynamics, and preventing complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and infection."

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2197-4-21**]:
   1. Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes. Probable
   bilateral
   pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
   2. Opacity overlying the mid lower chest may represent a hiatal hernia
   or a tortuous-dilated aorta. PA and lateral view of the chest may be
   helpful in
   further evaluation.
   3. Prominence of the azygos vein.
   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # ST elevations:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent
   with STEMI, however this was not supported by the findings on
   echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one would expect
   with the lateral ST elevations.  Echo did show severe diastolic
   dysfunction and right systolic dysfunction.  The patient noted chest
   pain for several days prior to admission and was originally managed
   medically for what was thought to be STEMI because he was not a good
   candidate for catheterization and reperfusion.  However, in light of
   his echo findings which do not correlate well with his EKG findings,
   one must also consider other causes for his diffuse ST changes such as
   myo/pericarditis.  Pt also had uremia which may have precipitated
   this.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - stop plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - stop atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume dispite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is
   likely a new insult and may have been due to MI or PE.  Pt presented
   with signs of multi-organ dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising
   lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
 goal JVP 14-16 cm
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60 (would
   discourage use of inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and
   diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN.
   Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated electrolyte
   disturbances causing the EKG changes
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal
   - f.u renal U/S
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   - family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus CMO
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.  This am potassium
   was hemolyzed
   - repeat potassium and check pm lytes as well
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs yesterday.
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.
   - obtain OSH records regarding time course of PE/DVT
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE (creatinine elevated preventing CT scan)
   - continue to monitor
   - stop heparin gtt today
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower
   than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic compromise)
   will titrate up PRN
   .
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   .
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.  Family
   meeting today to discuss HD versus CMO
   .
   # DVT ppx: IVC filter, pneumoboots
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2197-4-21**]:
   1. Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes. Probable
   bilateral
   pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
   2. Opacity overlying the mid lower chest may represent a hiatal hernia
   or a tortuous-dilated aorta. PA and lateral view of the chest may be
   helpful in
   further evaluation.
   3. Prominence of the azygos vein.
   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # ST elevations:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent
   with STEMI, however this was not supported by the findings on
   echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one would expect
   with the lateral ST elevations.  Echo did show severe diastolic
   dysfunction and right systolic dysfunction.  The patient noted chest
   pain for several days prior to admission and was originally managed
   medically for what was thought to be STEMI because he was not a good
   candidate for catheterization and reperfusion.  However, in light of
   his echo findings which do not correlate well with his EKG findings,
   one must also consider other causes for his diffuse ST changes such as
   myo/pericarditis.  Pt also had uremia which may have precipitated
   this.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - stop plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - stop atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume dispite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is
   likely a new insult and may have been due to MI or PE.  Pt presented
   with signs of multi-organ dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising
   lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
 goal JVP 14-16 cm
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60 (would
   discourage use of inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and
   diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN.
   Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated electrolyte
   disturbances causing the EKG changes
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal
   - f.u renal U/S
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   - family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus CMO
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.  This am potassium
   was hemolyzed
   - repeat potassium and check pm lytes as well
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve

   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs yesterday.
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.
   - obtain OSH records regarding time course of PE/DVT
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE (creatinine elevated preventing CT scan)
   - continue to monitor
   - stop heparin gtt today

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. **Renal Failure**: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which may worsen due to hypoperfusion, cardiogenic shock, and aortic stenosis. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and electrolytes is crucial.
2. **Cardiovascular Complications**: The patient has severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction, which may lead to further cardiac compromise. The patient's condition may deteriorate rapidly, and close monitoring is necessary.
3. **Hypotension**: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and further hypotension may occur due to cardiogenic shock, aortic stenosis, and renal failure. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and vasopressor support may be necessary.
4. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may worsen due to renal failure. Close monitoring of potassium levels and treatment with kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin may be necessary.
5. **Metabolic Acidosis**: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may worsen due to poor perfusion and decreased stroke volume. Close monitoring of lactate levels and acid-base status is necessary.
6. **Pulmonary Embolism/DVT**: The patient has a history of PE and DVT, and new PE may have occurred, explaining the right heart dysfunction. Close monitoring for PE/DVT and consideration of V/Q scan or CT scan are necessary.
7. **Decubitus Ulcer**: The patient has sacral and foot decubitus ulcers, which may worsen due to immobility and pressure. Close monitoring and consideration of wound care consult are necessary.
8. **Osteoarthritis**: The patient has chronic osteoarthritis, which may worsen due to immobility and pain. Close monitoring of pain control and consideration of physical therapy are necessary.
9. **Anemia**: The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia, which may worsen due to blood loss and decreased erythropoiesis. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of transfusions are necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   - potassium 7.0 gave kayexalate (not working well due to colostomy?)
   and 1 amp bicarb
   - renal estimates 24-48 hrs before he declines rapidly given the rate
   of his refractory hyperkalemia
   - After seeing the [**Doctor Last Name **] which did not show regional wall motion
   abnormailty c/w ST elevations, discussed that his renal failure may not
   be secondary to cardiogenic shock, but rather the inciting incident
   that caused his uremia which may have led to the EKG changes; because
   this may potentially be reversible, discussed with renal and pt the
   option of CVVH and pt wishes to go forward
   - met with family who supported CVVH
   - tried to obtain records and found the following:
         Had DVT in [**2186**] in one leg and then in [**2183**] in other leg
         Had IVC filter placed [**2183**]
         [**2190**] had PE and was continued on coumadin
         [**1-14**] had large GIB from AV malformation requiring large
   transfusion and right hemicolectomy
         [**12-14**] had AAA repair

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # ST elevations:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent
   with STEMI, however this was not supported by the findings on
   echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one would expect
   with the lateral ST elevations.  Echo did show severe diastolic
   dysfunction and right systolic dysfunction.  The patient noted chest
   pain for several days prior to admission and was originally managed
   medically for what was thought to be STEMI because he was not a good
   candidate for catheterization and reperfusion.  However, in light of
   his echo findings which do not correlate well with his EKG findings,
   one must also consider other causes for his diffuse ST changes such as
   myo/pericarditis.  Pt also had uremia which may have precipitated
   this.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - stop plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - stop atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume dispite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is
   likely a new insult and may have been due to MI or PE.  Pt presented
   with signs of multi-organ dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising
   lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
 goal JVP 14-16 cm
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60 (would
   discourage use of inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and
   diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN.
   Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated electrolyte
   disturbances causing the EKG changes
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal
   - f.u renal U/S
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   - family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus CMO
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.  This am potassium
   was hemolyzed
   - repeat potassium and check pm lytes as well
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs yesterday.
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.
   - obtain OSH records regarding time course of PE/DVT
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE (creatinine elevated preventing CT scan)
   - continue to monitor
   - stop heparin gtt today
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower
   than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic compromise)
   will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.  Family
   meeting today to discuss HD versus CMO
   # DVT ppx: IVC filter, pneumoboots
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**])

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and massive gastrointestinal bleed. He presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Shock: likely secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure, hypertrophic left ventricular (LV) with poor stroke volume despite normal ejection fraction, and aortic stenosis.
2. Oliguric renal failure: most likely secondary to hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume.
4. Hyperkalemia: likely related to renal failure, with potassium levels peaking at 7.0 mg/dL.
5. Anemia: chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac-positive contents in the ileostomy.
6. Pulmonary embolism/DVT: not on coumadin due to history of GI bleed, with an IVC filter in place.
7. Osteoarthritis: with ongoing oxycodone therapy.

The patient's current medications include:

* Aspirin 325 daily
* Plavix (stopped due to bleeding risk and questionable benefit)
* Atorvastatin (stopped due to elevated liver enzymes and questionable benefit)
* Beta blocker (held due to hypotension)
* ACEi (considered for initiation if BP tolerates)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
* Sodium bicarbonate 8.4% (Amp)
* Kayexalate (given for hyperkalemia)
* Insulin/glucose (given for hyperkalemia)

The patient's current lab results include:

* Troponin-T: 7.56 ng/mL
* Creatinine: 7.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 104 mg/dL
* Sodium: 139 mEq/L
* Potassium: 6.9 mEq/L
* Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 8.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 775 IU/L

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing asprin 325 daily
* Stopping plavix and heparin gtt due to bleeding risk and questionable benefit
* Holding beta blocker due to hypotension
* Considering initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
* Monitoring BP closely
* Optimizing hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion
* Renal diet and renally dosed medications
* Kayexalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
* Family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock
* Right ventricular failure
* Acute tubular necrosis
* Hyperkalemia
* Anion gap metabolic acidosis
* Pulmonary embolism/DVT
* Osteoarthritis
* Sacral and foot decubitus ulcers
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Renal failure
* Respiratory failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - Continue  phenylephrine gtt PRN for MAP > 60 (would discourage use of
   inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and diastolic dysfunction
   - consider CTA with contrast removal by CVVH to r/o PE
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident
   with a history of HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter,
   massive GI bleed who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and
   is transferred for further management of STEMI.
   24 Hour Events:

   [**4-22**]
   - potassium 7.0 gave kayexalate (not working well due to colostomy?)
   and 1 amp bicarb
   - renal estimates 24-48 hrs before he declines rapidly given the rate
   of his refractory hyperkalemia
   - After seeing the [**Doctor Last Name **] which did not show regional wall motion
   abnormailty c/w ST elevations, discussed that his renal failure may not
   be secondary to cardiogenic shock, but rather the inciting incident
   that caused his uremia which may have led to the EKG changes; because
   this may potentially be reversible, discussed with renal and pt the
   option of CVVH and pt wishes to go forward
   - met with family who supported CVVH
   - tried to obtain records and found the following:
         Had DVT in [**2186**] in one leg and then in [**2183**] in other leg
         Had IVC filter placed [**2183**]
         [**2190**] had PE and was continued on coumadin
         [**1-14**] had large GIB from AV malformation requiring large
   transfusion and right hemicolectomy
         [**12-14**] had AAA repair
         [**2197-3-19**] had known creatinine 1.2
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1294**] VA: echo performed in [**5-14**] showed RV was normal in size and
   function (compared to now with right ventricular systolic dysfunction),
   LV small with concentric hypertrophy, LVEF >70% and no regional wall
   abnormalities, aortic valve area 1.3 cm2, mild to moderate mitral
   stenosis.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE, and massive GI bleed, who presented to the hospital with chest pain and is being managed for STEMI. He has developed shock, oliguric renal failure, hyperkalemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, and pulmonary embolism/DVT. He has been started on CVVH, pressors, and diuretics, and is being monitored closely for hemodynamic instability and electrolyte disturbances.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiac arrest due to hypotension and decreased cardiac output
	* Development of cardiogenic shock
	* Worsening of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and decreased LV function
2. Renal complications:
	* Progression to anuric renal failure
	* Development of acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Increased risk of hyperkalemia and acidosis
3. Pulmonary complications:
	* Worsening of pulmonary embolism/DVT
	* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Increased risk of pneumonia
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding
	* Increased risk of sepsis
5. Hematological complications:
	* Development of anemia
	* Increased risk of bleeding due to decreased platelet count
6. Infections:
	* Development of sepsis
	* Increased risk of pneumonia and urinary tract infections
7. Metabolic complications:
	* Development of hyperkalemia
	* Increased risk of acidosis and electrolyte disturbances
8. Cardiovascular complications:
	* Development of atrial fibrillation
	* Increased risk of stroke and thromboembolic events

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing various medical complications due to his underlying conditions and the interventions being used to manage them. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these complications will be necessary to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcome."

   Echo from OSH: normal RV in [**5-14**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - Continue  phenylephrine gtt PRN for MAP > 60 (would discourage use of
   inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and diastolic dysfunction
   - consider CTA with contrast removal by CVVH to r/o PE
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**])
   # DISPO: CCU

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events over past 24 hours reviewed with CCU team:
   Decision for CVVH based on possible recovery of RV function, absence of
   evidence of STEMIn as etiology, possible  improved cardiac output and
   acute renal insult (normal kidney size);
   Line placement and CVVH in progress with good tolerance
   Physical Examination
   Pericardial rub not heard today; short 2/6 systolic murmur of AS; no
   diastolic murmur;
   less alert currently;
   Medical Decision Making
   Willl continue CVVH and follow renal parameters with renal team;
   Trial fluid bolus as means to improve LV preload and cardiac output;
   Continue low dose phenylephrine for BP support

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - Continue  phenylephrine gtt PRN for MAP > 60 (would discourage use of
   inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and diastolic dysfunction
   - consider CTA with contrast removal by CVVH to r/o PE
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events over past 24 hours reviewed with CCU team:
   Decision for CVVH based on possible recovery of RV function, absence of
   evidence of STEMIn as etiology, possible  improved cardiac output and
   acute renal insult (normal kidney size);
   Line placement and CVVH in progress with good tolerance
   Physical Examination
   Pericardial rub not heard today; short 2/6 systolic murmur of AS; no
   diastolic murmur;
   less alert currently;
   Medical Decision Making
   Willl continue CVVH and follow renal parameters with renal team;
   Trial fluid bolus as means to improve LV preload and cardiac output;
   Continue low dose phenylephrine for BP support

Summary:

Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**], an 85-year-old nursing home resident, was admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism (PE), and massive gastrointestinal bleed. He presented with chest pain and was transferred for further management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with worsening renal failure, hyperkalemia, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is at risk of cardiogenic shock due to right ventricular (RV) failure, hypertrophic left ventricular (LV) with poor stroke volume, and aortic stenosis.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely pre-renal secondary to hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size secondary to hypertrophy and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV preload.
3. ST Elevations: The ST elevations may be due to pericarditis caused by uremia or STEMI, but the echocardiogram did not show LV dysfunction, which is unexpected.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is likely related to renal failure and is being managed with kayexalate, bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, likely due to poor perfusion caused by decreased stroke volume.
6. Pulmonary Embolism/DVT: The patient has a history of PE and DVT, and new PE may explain right heart dysfunction.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient has a history of osteoarthritis and is receiving treatment with oxycontin and oxycodone.
8. Sacral and Foot Decubitus: The patient is at risk of developing sacral and foot decubitus ulcers.
9. Goals of Care: The patient's goals of care have changed from full code to DNR/DNI.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH and monitor renal parameters with the renal team.
2. Trial fluid bolus as a means to improve LV preload and cardiac output.
3. Continue low-dose phenylephrine for BP support.
4. Consider CTA with contrast removal by CVVH to rule out PE.
5. Monitor BP closely.
6. Consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates.
7. Continue to trend lactate levels.
8. Continue to monitor hct and consider transfusions if necessary.
9. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
10. Follow closely for PR prolongation, QRS widening, and other electrolyte disturbances."

   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE, and massive GI bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of STEMI.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic; Renal failure, acute; Hypotension; Acute coronary syndrome; Coronary ischemia
* Respiratory: Low lung volumes; Heart size unchanged
* Neurological: Responds to stimuli, but no assessment of movement, tone, or reflexes
* Gastrointestinal: Right colectomy changes; Good output into the right lower quadrant ostomy bag
* Renal: Oliguric renal failure; Elevated creatinine and lactate
* Hemodynamic: Hypotension; Shock likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor stroke volume
* Pain: Chest pain; Right hip pain

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: Cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, or pulmonary edema due to the patient's cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome
* Renal complications: Further deterioration of renal function, electrolyte imbalances, or acidosis due to the patient's acute renal failure
* Respiratory complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia, or respiratory acidosis due to the patient's low lung volumes and heart failure
* Neurological complications: Seizures, stroke, or cognitive decline due to the patient's poor perfusion and multi-organ dysfunction
* Gastrointestinal complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction due to the patient's previous GI bleed and current oliguric renal failure
* Hematological complications: Bleeding or thrombocytopenia due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and multi-organ dysfunction

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Cardiac support: Pressors, IVF bolus, and cardiac healthy diet
* Renal support: CVVH, optimization of hemodynamics, and renal diet
* Pain management: Opioids and non-opioid analgesics
* Anticoagulation therapy: Heparin gtt
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Nutrition: Glycemic control and IV nutrition
* Lines: Midline, dialysis catheter, and prophylactic antibiotics

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is to the CCU."

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine. Rising lactate most likely secondary to phenylephrine
   causing peripheral vasoconstriction and end-organ damage
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - Trial of dopamine today
   - monitor BP closely
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Lactate high at 18, now at 12, and AG
   from 35 to 22 after DC
ing phenylephrine, most likely secondary to
   severe cardiogenic shock exacerbated by vasoconstriction in effort to
   maintain blood pressures.
   - DC phenylephrine
   - Bolus PRN, with caution given patient is oliguric
   - Trial of dopamine per above
   - continue to trend
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - Would recommend against CVVH, as would likely be medically futile
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 50) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus and dopamine)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Liver failure: Patient with liver failure leading to worsening
   coaggulopathy and hypoglycemic secondary to impaired gluconeogenisis,
   and probably contributing to the elevated lactate.
   - trend enzymes
   - avoid Tylenol
   - treat underlying condition with IVF and dopamine trial today
   # Anemia:  HCT drop likely hemodilutional in setting of receiving
   several liters of fluid and all counts being down. Chronic iron
   deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive contents in ileostomy.
   Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct, recheck at CBC at 1pm, if HCT <25 can offer
   transfusion to family during meeting today if they still favor
   aggressive management
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt for now, pending goals of care discussion
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac, renal and diabetic diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**]), will have a goals of care discussion
   with family today to readdress as patient
s status is grave.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: chest pain
   24 Hour Events:
 MIDLINE - START [**2197-4-23**] 03:34 PM
   [**4-23**]
   - PICC line placed due to difficulty drawing labs; of note, was diffult
   to position, is currently positioned....
   - Noted to have several hypoglycemic empisodes in the morning. Insulin
   decreased.
   - Bicarb 10 on AM labs; RR and temperature mildly increased. This
   prompted ABG --> very acidodic with lactate of 16. Only complaint
   remains right hip pain.
   - Volume repleted with 2L D5W with 3 amps NaHCO3
   - Urgent abdominal/hip CT basically negative. One area near AAA graft
   which could potentially represent a tiny endo leak, although difficult
   to say on this study (definitely not a major leak per radiology).
   Advanced degenerative disease of the right hip.
   - Spoke with family at 7:30P, reviwed poor prognosis.

   # Anemia:  HCT drop likely hemodilutional in setting of receiving
   several liters of fluid and all counts being down. Chronic iron
   deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive contents in ileostomy.
   Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct, recheck at CBC at 1pm, if HCT <25 can offer
   transfusion to family during meeting today if they still favor
   aggressive management
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt for now, pending goals of care discussion
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac, renal and diabetic diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**]), will have a goals of care discussion
   with family today to readdress as patient
s status is grave.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

1. Cardiac Status:
	* Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic
	* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST elevations on ECG
	* Right ventricular (RV) failure, likely secondary to MI or PE
	* Hypotension, likely due to cardiogenic shock
2. Renal Status:
	* Oliguric renal failure, likely pre-renal secondary to hypoperfusion
	* Creatinine 1.2, with rising lactate levels
	* No CVVH recommended due to limited life expectancy and potential for medical futility
3. Metabolic Status:
	* Anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to cardiogenic shock and vasoconstriction
	* Hyperkalemia, likely related to renal failure
	* Liver failure, leading to worsening coagulopathy and hypoglycemia
	* Anemia, likely hemodilutional in setting of receiving several liters of fluid
4. Other Conditions:
	* Decubitus ulcer, present at admission
	* Osteoarthritis, with ongoing pain management
	* Sacral and foot decubitus, requiring wound care consultation
	* Pulmonary embolism/DVT, with IVC filter in place, but not on coumadin due to history of GI bleed
5. Goals of Care:
	* Patient has changed from full code to DNR/DNI, with a goals of care discussion planned with family today
	* Patient's status is grave, with limited life expectancy

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

1. Further cardiogenic shock and hemodynamic instability
2. Worsening renal failure and electrolyte imbalances
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to liver failure and coagulopathy
4. Development of sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
5. Potential for further complications from decubitus ulcers and osteoarthritis
6. Risk of respiratory failure due to underlying chronic conditions
7. Potential for further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest

Given the patient's grave prognosis and limited life expectancy, it is essential to focus on palliative care and symptom management, while also addressing any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75.3 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has undergone several procedures, including placement of a PICC line, insertion of a dialysis catheter, and a CT scan of the abdomen. His current condition is complicated by acute renal failure, hypertension, and hypotension. He is receiving treatment for pain, including morphine sulfate, and is being monitored for cardiac ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypoglycemic episodes and increased lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further evaluation of his blood cultures and imaging studies is needed to determine the source of the infection.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. Further evaluation of his cardiac function and monitoring of his rhythm is needed.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a significant concern, and further evaluation of his kidney function and potential causes of the failure is needed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a concern, and further evaluation of his blood pressure and potential causes of the hypotension is needed.
5. Pain management: The patient's chronic pain and acute pain from the chest pain require adequate pain management. Further evaluation of his pain levels and potential causes of the pain is needed.
6. Infection: The patient's positive MRSA screen and pending blood and urine cultures suggest the possibility of an infection. Further evaluation of his infection and potential causes of the infection is needed.
7. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer is a concern, and further evaluation of his skin integrity and potential causes of the ulcer is needed.
8. Endoleak: The patient's CT scan of the abdomen suggests the possibility of an endoleak. Further evaluation of the endoleak and potential causes of the leak is needed.
9. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac ischemia symptoms suggest the possibility of cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation of his cardiac function and potential causes of the ischemia is needed.
10. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Further evaluation of his respiratory function and potential causes of the failure is needed."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**])

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient is suffering from cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and hypotension, which are likely secondary to right ventricular failure, hypertrophic left ventricular dysfunction, and aortic stenosis. The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely pre-renal due to hypoperfusion from poor forward flow caused by decreased left ventricular chamber size secondary to hypertrophy and newly failed right ventricle.

The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely related to poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume, and the patient's hyperkalemia is likely related to renal failure. The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and the patient's anemia is chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac-positive contents in the ileostomy.

The patient's pulmonary embolism/DVT is a concern, as the patient has a history of GI bleed and is not on coumadin. The patient's osteoarthritis is managed with oxycontin and oxycodone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and hypotension increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Renal failure progression: The patient's oliguric renal failure can progress to acute tubular necrosis or chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and oliguric renal failure increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed and use of anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines increase the risk of sepsis.
7. Decubitus ulcer progression: The patient's sacral and foot decubitus ulcers can progress to deep tissue injury if not managed properly.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and poor nutritional intake increase the risk of malnutrition.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and anion gap metabolic acidosis increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
10. Pulmonary embolism/DVT progression: The patient's pulmonary embolism/DVT can progress to saddle embolism or pulmonary infarction if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the patient's disposition is to the CCU."
