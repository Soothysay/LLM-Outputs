You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent STEMI, and chronic diastolic dysfunction, is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and suspected cardiac event. He has been experiencing recurrent pulmonary effusions and is on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 80s-90s/50s mmHg, oxygen saturation of 92-95% on 3LNC, and a heart rate of 72 bpm. His laboratory results show elevated troponin and CK levels, indicating cardiac injury. He is being treated with heparin, ranitidine, and fluconazole, and is receiving IV fluids and dopamine to maintain blood pressure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of recurrent pulmonary effusions and diastolic dysfunction increases his risk of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his hypotension and cardiac injury.
3. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and recent hemodialysis may increase his risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of his renal function.
4. Infection: The patient's history of esophagitis and recent antibiotic use may increase his risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
5. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase his risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of hypotension and cardiac injury.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of depression and recent use of analgesics may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or altered mental status.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and aggressive management of his cardiac, respiratory, and renal status are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, and ESRD on HD, who presents with hypotension after dialysis, troponin elevation, and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions. He has known chronic diastolic failure and is at risk for cardiac events. The patient is being treated with fluid boluses to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg and is being monitored for signs of cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and troponin elevation suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which could be exacerbated by his known chronic diastolic failure.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of recurrent pulmonary effusions and his current hypotension increase the risk of pulmonary edema, which could further compromise his respiratory status.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD on HD and his current hypotension increase the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of his renal function.
4. Infection: The patient's history of esophagitis and UGIB increases the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of his compromised immune system.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of esophagitis and UGIB increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of his compromised coagulation status.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of recurrent pulmonary effusions and his current hypotension increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could further compromise his overall status.
7. Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and his current hypotension increase the risk of cardiac rhythm disturbances, which could further compromise his cardiac function.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Holding blood pressure medications and giving fluid boluses to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg
* Continuing telemetry and monitoring for signs of cardiogenic shock
* Trending troponin, CK, and CK/MB every 6 hours
* Continuing heparin gtt for prophylaxis and hypokinesis
* Gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
* Holding off on nodal agents due to continued hypotension
* Monitoring for signs of pleural effusions and draining as needed
* Continuing HD on regular schedule
* Monitoring for signs of infection and sepsis
* Continuing prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's plan also includes continuing his home medications, including allopruinol for gout, fluconazole for recurrent esophagitis, and citalopram for depression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cardiac arrest, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension after dialysis, elevated troponin levels, and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with possible myocardial infarction (MI). The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary effusions, diastolic dysfunction, and chronic diastolic failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 82/67 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 3L nasal cannula. His respiratory support includes oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, with a troponin level of 1.09 ng/mL, and an ECG with mildly increased ST depressions. His hemoglobin is 12.5 g/dL, and his platelet count is 269 K/uL.

The patient's plan includes holding beta blockers and imdur, administering fluid boluses to maintain a blood pressure above 90 mmHg, and monitoring for signs of cardiogenic shock. The patient will also receive heparin for prophylaxis and aspirin for antiplatelet therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient's ECG changes and elevated troponin levels are consistent with possible MI, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.
3. Pulmonary effusions: The patient's history of recurrent pulmonary effusions increases the risk of respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's diastolic dysfunction can lead to heart failure, pulmonary edema, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD on HD increases the risk of complications related to dialysis, such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his cardiogenic shock, possible MI, pulmonary effusions, diastolic dysfunction, and ESRD on HD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, and STEMI, who is currently in the ICU due to hypotension after dialysis. He has known chronic diastolic dysfunction and recently suffered a suspected MI. He is on HD for ESRD and has a history of recurrent pulmonary effusions. The patient's current condition is characterized by hypotension, troponin elevation, and ECG changes consistent with an MI. He is receiving fluid boluses to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg and is being monitored for mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to recent MI or LV systolic failure
	* RV failure of unclear etiology
	* Possible cardiac event
2. Hypotension:
	* Multifactorial causes, including fluid removal during dialysis, cardiac event, and administration of analgesic medications
3. Pulmonary Complications:
	* Recurrent pulmonary effusions
	* Possible pneumonia or sepsis
4. Renal Complications:
	* ESRD on HD
	* Possible acute kidney injury due to hypotension or cardiac event
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* History of esophagitis and UGIB, which may be exacerbated by the patient's current condition
6. Infectious Complications:
	* Possible sepsis or pneumonia
7. Other Complications:
	* Possible gout flare due to changes in medication regimen
	* Possible depression or anxiety due to current medical condition and treatment regimen"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**],
   diastolic dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p
   bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, presents with
   hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation
   and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday). Also possibly cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 90 mmHg
   - BP now returning to baseline this AM
   - Will continue to monitor after dialysis. If Pt hemodynamically stable
   and asymptomatic Pt can be transferred to floor after dialysis
   .
   # CORONARIES: ECG with mildly increased ST depressions, slightly
   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal
   equivalent.  It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few
   weeks.

   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses

   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped after pt
   found to have oozing AVM on colonoscopy
   -heparin ggt
   -will hold off on nodal agents given continued hypotension.
   .
   # Pleural effusions: Per IP, plan pleurex drainage PRN if Pt w/

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, CABG, and STEMI, who presented with hypotension after dialysis, troponin elevation, and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 82/67 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 91%. He is receiving fluids and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure above 90 mmHg.

The patient has new RV failure, which may be related to the recent MI and LV systolic failure. He has known chronic diastolic failure. The patient's troponin levels are slightly elevated, and he is being treated with heparin, aspirin, and Plavix.

The patient has a history of esophagitis, and he is being treated with ranitidine. He also has a history of depression and is being treated with citalopram.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's new RV failure and LV systolic failure may lead to pulmonary edema.
3. Sepsis: The patient's temperature elevation and lack of evidence of infection may indicate sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of esophagitis and gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased lung function and respiratory acidosis may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Kidney failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent dialysis may worsen, leading to kidney failure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalances may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalance.
8. Infection: The patient's history of esophagitis and gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**], diastolic
   dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p
   bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, presents with
   hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation
   and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.  Episode of chest pain
   during HD on [**2102-10-23**], now s/p failed PCI, intubated, with persistent
   hypotension.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday).  Less likely cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.  Persistent hypotension
   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)
   -will start dopamine if patient becomes unresponsive to IVF
   -Send Blood Cx
   -Will not start antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
   -pt would likely benefit from continuous a-line monitoring (ABGs, BP),
   difficult right radial placement, will likely need fem a-line
   -hypotension likely [**3-20**] RV failure (ishemia vs. left heart diastolic
   failure as etiology), less likely hypovolemic, septic, adrenal insuff,
   neurogenic, cardiogenic or tamponade physiology
   -will f/u results of TTE this morning
   .
   # CORONARIES: ECG will mildly increased ST depressions, slightly
   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal
   equivalent.  It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few
   weeks.   P/w chest pain yesterday morning, now s/p unsuccessful PCI
   -Trend troponin, CK and CK/MB Q6H x 2
   -continue telemetry
   -heparin ggt has been discontinued
   -ASA 325
   -Plavix 75, will switch omeprazole to zantac
   -Pravastatin 80
   .
   # PUMP:  Previously normal EF, but could be decreased now in the
   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt also for hypokinesis
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped (reason
   no clear from patient/chart).
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt
   -will hold off on nodal agents given continued hypotension.
   .
   #Acute respiratory alkalosis
 improving, likely [**3-20**] anxiety.  Pt
   continues to have high plateau pressures, improving.  Rate and
   alkalosis also improving.  Less likely etiologies include PE and PNA.
   - Wean sedation today for extubation
   # Pleural effusions: Per IP, plan for daily pleurex drainage.  L
   pleurex drained 250 cc 9/5.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal following, plan to continue HD on regular schedule
   of M/W/F.  Last HD [**10-20**].
   -monitor lytes
   -continue sevelamer
   -continue prednisone
   .
   # Hx esophagitis/ h/o UGIB: Omeprazole changed to Ranitidine.  Will
   order active T&S.
   .
   # Gout: Continue home dose allopruinol.
   # Recurrent [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis: Continue home dose fluconazole.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, and ESRD on HD. He presented with hypotension after dialysis, troponin elevation, and ECG changes, consistent with anterior ischemia. He underwent emergent PCI, which was technically difficult, and was intubated due to agitation in the cath lab. The procedure was unsuccessful, and the patient is now intubated and sedated.

The patient's current condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is persistently low, and it is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including fluid removal at dialysis, cardiac event, and administration of analgesic medications.
2. Acute respiratory alkalosis: The patient has a high rate and high plateau pressures, which are improving, likely due to anxiety.
3. New RV failure: The patient has new RV failure of unclear etiology, which may be related to recent MI and LV systolic failure or chronic diastolic failure.
4. Cardiac rhythm: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped, and may require restarting heparin ggt.
5. Pleural effusions: The patient has chronic pleural effusions, which require daily pleurex drainage.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient is on regular HD schedule, and his renal function is being monitored.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a history of esophagitis, UGIB, and depression, which require ongoing management.
8. Potential bleeding risk: The patient has a history of life-threatening GI bleed and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Hold blood pressure medications (beta blocker, imdur) and give fluid boluses to keep SBP above 80 mmHg.
2. Monitor mental status and consider restarting dopamine if the patient becomes unresponsive to IVF.
3. Send blood cultures and consider antibiotics if there is evidence of infection.
4. Start dopamine if the patient becomes unresponsive to IVF.
5. Trend troponin, CK, and CK/MB every 6 hours.
6. Continue telemetry and heparin ggt discontinuation.
7. ASA 325, Plavix 75, and Pravastatin 80 therapy.
8. Gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses.
9. Consider restarting heparin ggt for hypokinesis.
10. Monitor lytes and continue sevelamer, prednisone, and Ranitidine therapy.
11. Order active T&S for esophagitis and UGIB.
12. Continue home dose allopruinol for gout and fluconazole for recurrent esophagitis.
13. Continue home dose citalopram for depression.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is CCU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He underwent an emergent PCI procedure due to anterior ischemia, but the procedure was technically difficult and the mid-PDA graft stenosis was occluded distal to restenosis. The patient was intubated and sedated, and is currently managed on invasive ventilation. He has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 79/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) due to the occlusion of the mid-PDA graft stenosis
	* Heart failure due to the patient's pre-existing chronic heart disease
	* Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, which is currently present
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and possible aspiration
	* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's history of chronic renal failure and potential nephrotoxicity from medications
	* Chronic kidney disease progression
4. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and potential bacterial colonization
	* Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Delirium due to the patient's sedation and potential underlying neurological conditions
	* Cerebral edema due to the patient's hypotension and potential hypoxia
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Stress ulceration due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and potential gastrointestinal bleeding
7. Hemodynamic Complications:
	* Hypotension due to the patient's chronic hypertension and potential medication side effects
	* Shock due to the patient's chronic heart disease and potential hypovolemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**], diastolic
   dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p
   bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, presents with
   hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation
   and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.  Episode of chest pain
   during HD on [**2102-10-23**], now s/p failed PCI, intubated, with persistent
   hypotension.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday).  Less likely cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.  Persistent hypotension
   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)
   -will start dopamine if patient becomes unresponsive to IVF
   -Send Blood Cx
   -Will not start antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
   -pt would likely benefit from continuous a-line monitoring (ABGs, BP),
   difficult right radial placement, will likely need fem a-line
   -hypotension likely [**3-20**] RV failure (ishemia vs. left heart diastolic
   failure as etiology), less likely hypovolemic, septic, adrenal insuff,
   neurogenic, cardiogenic or tamponade physiology
   -will f/u results of TTE this morning
   .
   # CORONARIES: ECG will mildly increased ST depressions, slightly
   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal
   equivalent.  It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few
   weeks.   P/w chest pain yesterday morning, now s/p unsuccessful PCI
   -Trend troponin, CK and CK/MB Q6H x 2
   -continue telemetry
   -heparin ggt has been discontinued
   -ASA 325
   -Plavix 75, will switch omeprazole to zantac
   -Pravastatin 80
   .
   # PUMP:  Previously normal EF, but could be decreased now in the
   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt also for hypokinesis
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped (reason
   no clear from patient/chart).
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt
   -will hold off on nodal agents given continued hypotension.
   .
   #Acute respiratory alkalosis
 improving, likely [**3-20**] anxiety.  Pt
   continues to have high plateau pressures, improving.  Rate and
   alkalosis also improving.  Less likely etiologies include PE and PNA.
   -? Wean sedation today for extubation -> will discuss on rounds
   # Pleural effusions: Per IP, plan for daily pleurex drainage.  L

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**], diastolic
   dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p
   bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, presents with
   hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation
   and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.  Episode of chest pain
   during HD on [**2102-10-23**], now s/p failed PCI, intubated, with persistent
   hypotension.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday).  Less likely cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.  Persistent hypotension
   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)
   -will start dopamine if patient becomes unresponsive to IVF
   -Send Blood Cx
   -Will not start antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
   -pt would likely benefit from continuous a-line monitoring (ABGs, BP),
   difficult right radial placement, will likely need fem a-line
   -hypotension likely [**3-20**] RV failure (ishemia vs. left heart diastolic
   failure as etiology), less likely hypovolemic, septic, adrenal insuff,
   neurogenic, cardiogenic or tamponade physiology
   -will f/u results of TTE this morning
   .
   # CORONARIES: ECG will mildly increased ST depressions, slightly
   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal
   equivalent.  It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few
   weeks.   P/w chest pain yesterday morning, now s/p unsuccessful PCI
   -Trend troponin, CK and CK/MB Q6H x 2
   -continue telemetry
   -heparin ggt has been discontinued
   -ASA 325
   -Plavix 75, will switch omeprazole to zantac
   -Pravastatin 80
   .
   # PUMP:  Previously normal EF, but could be decreased now in the
   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt also for hypokinesis
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped (reason
   no clear from patient/chart).
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt
   -will hold off on nodal agents given continued hypotension.
   .
   #Acute respiratory alkalosis
 improving, likely [**3-20**] anxiety.  Pt
   continues to have high plateau pressures, improving.  Rate and
   alkalosis also improving.  Less likely etiologies include PE and PNA.
   -? Wean sedation today for extubation -> will discuss on rounds

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic diastolic dysfunction, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presented with chest pain during dialysis, which was relieved with nitroglycerin, and was found to have ECG changes consistent with anterior ischemia. He underwent emergent PCI, which was technically difficult, and was unable to stent a mid-PDA graft stenosis due to graft occlusion.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a history of recurrent pulmonary effusions, and is being treated for hypotension. His blood pressure is currently in the 70s-80s mmHg, and he has required one 500cc NS bolus. He has a central venous catheter in place, but was unable to have a right radial line placed.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm
* Blood pressure: 79/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%

His laboratory results show:

* Troponin: 1.61 ng/mL
* Creatinine: 6.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 36 mg/dL
* Glucose: 77 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 8.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 184 K/uL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: likely multifactorial, possibly related to fluid removal during dialysis, cardiac event, or administration of analgesic medications. The patient is being treated with fluid boluses and dopamine, and will be monitored for signs of cardiac dysfunction.
* Coronaries: the patient has mild ST depression on his ECG, elevated cardiac enzymes, and a history of chest pain. He is being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin, and will have his troponin, CK, and CK-MB levels trended every 6 hours.
* Pump: the patient's left ventricular function is likely decreased due to recent myocardial infarction, and he has new right ventricular failure of unclear etiology. He is being treated with gentle fluid resuscitation and will be considered for restarting heparin.
* Rhythm: the patient is in atrial fibrillation, and will be considered for restarting heparin. He will be held off on nodal agents due to ongoing hypotension.
* Acute respiratory alkalosis: the patient's alkalosis is likely related to anxiety, and he will be weaned off sedation today for extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: including further cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: including respiratory failure, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.
* Renal complications: including acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease.
* Infection: including sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections.
* Gastrointestinal complications: including gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, or vomiting.

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, and his code status is full code."

   65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**], diastolic
   dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p
   bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, presents with
   hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation
   and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.  Episode of chest pain
   during HD on [**2102-10-23**], now s/p failed PCI, intubated, with persistent
   hypotension.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday).  Less likely cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.  Persistent hypotension
   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)
   -will start dopamine if patient becomes unresponsive to IVF
   -Send Blood Cx
   -Will not start antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
   -pt would likely benefit from continuous a-line monitoring (ABGs, BP),
   difficult right radial placement, will likely need fem a-line
   -hypotension likely [**3-20**] RV failure (ishemia vs. left heart diastolic
   failure as etiology), less likely hypovolemic, septic, adrenal insuff,
   neurogenic, cardiogenic or tamponade physiology
   -will f/u results of TTE this morning

   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal

   weeks.   P/w chest pain yesterday morning, now s/p unsuccessful PCI
   -Trend troponin, CK and CK/MB Q6H x 2
   -continue telemetry
   -heparin ggt has been discontinued
   -ASA 325
   -Plavix 75, will switch omeprazole to zantac
   -Pravastatin 80
   .
   # PUMP:  Previously normal EF, but could be decreased now in the
   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt also for hypokinesis
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, and ESRD on HD. He presented with chest pain during dialysis, which was relieved with nitro, but later became agitated and required endotracheal intubation. He underwent emergent PCI, but the procedure was technically difficult and failed to stent mid-PDA graft stenosis, resulting in graft occlusion distal to restenosis.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a Swan-Ganz catheter in place. He has a history of recurrent pulmonary effusions and is on HD three times a week. His vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 79/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

His laboratory results show:

* Troponin: 1.61 ng/mL
* CK: 150 IU/L
* CK-MB: 23 IU/L
* WBC: 8.5 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 34.4%
* Platelet count: 184 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 6.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 36 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 79/57 mmHg, which is low. This may be due to fluid removal during dialysis, cardiac event, or administration of analgesic medications.
2. Acute respiratory alkalosis: The patient's ABG shows an acute respiratory alkalosis, which may be due to anxiety or other factors.
3. Right ventricular failure: The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter data shows high right atrial pressures, suggesting right ventricular failure.
4. Left ventricular systolic failure: The patient's troponin and CK-MB levels are elevated, suggesting possible left ventricular systolic failure.
5. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic failure.
6. Pulmonary effusions: The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary effusions.

The patient's plan includes:

* Holding blood pressure medications and giving fluid boluses to keep systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg
* Monitoring mental status and sedation
* Starting dopamine if the patient becomes unresponsive to IV fluids
* Sending blood cultures
* Withholding antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
* Considering restarting heparin and aspirin
* Continuing HD on a regular schedule
* Monitoring electrolytes and adjusting medications as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**], diastolic
   dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p
   bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, presents with
   hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation
   and ECG with slightly increased ST depressions.  Episode of chest pain
   during HD on [**2102-10-23**], now s/p failed PCI, intubated, with persistent
   hypotension.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday).  Less likely cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.  Persistent hypotension
   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)
   -will start dopamine if patient becomes unresponsive to IVF
   -Send Blood Cx
   -Will not start antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
   -pt would likely benefit from continuous a-line monitoring (ABGs, BP),
   difficult right radial placement, will likely need fem a-line
   -hypotension likely [**3-20**] RV failure (ishemia vs. left heart diastolic
   failure as etiology), less likely hypovolemic, septic, adrenal insuff,
   neurogenic, cardiogenic or tamponade physiology
   -will f/u results of TTE this morning
   .
   # CORONARIES: ECG will mildly increased ST depressions, slightly
   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal
   equivalent.  It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few
   weeks.   P/w chest pain yesterday morning, now s/p unsuccessful PCI
   -Trend troponin, CK and CK/MB Q6H x 2
   -continue telemetry
   -heparin ggt has been discontinued
   -ASA 325
   -Plavix 75, will switch omeprazole to zantac
   -Pravastatin 80
   .
   # PUMP:  Previously normal EF, but could be decreased now in the
   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt also for hypokinesis
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped (reason
   no clear from patient/chart).
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt
   -will hold off on nodal agents given continued hypotension.
   .
   #Acute respiratory alkalosis
 improving, likely [**3-20**] anxiety.  Pt
   continues to have high plateau pressures, improving.  Rate and
   alkalosis also improving.  Less likely etiologies include PE and PNA.
   - Wean sedation today for extubation
   # Pleural effusions: Per IP, plan for daily pleurex drainage.  L
   pleurex drained 250 cc 9/5.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal following, plan to continue HD on regular schedule
   of M/W/F.  Last HD [**10-20**].
   -monitor lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**2102-10-23**]: Episode of chest pain late morning during HD, relieved somewhat
   with nitro, ECG concerning for anterior ischemia.  Pt underwent
   emergent PCI, technically difficult.  Pt became extremely agitated in
   cath lab, required endotracheal intubation.  Attempted and failed to
   stent mid-PDA graft stenosis, graft now occluded distal to restenosis.
   Pt managed on vent overnight, ABGs show acute respiratory alkalosis,
   with high rate and high plateau pressures.  Right IJ central cath
   place.  Unable to place right radial line.  Hypotensive with SBP in
   70s-80s overnight, given one 500cc NS bolus.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac bypass surgery (CABG) who presented with hypotension after dialysis, troponin elevation, and ECG changes. He underwent an emergent PCI, which was technically difficult, and became agitated, requiring endotracheal intubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s-80s mmHg, and he has received one 500cc NS bolus. The hypotension is likely multifactorial, possibly due to fluid removal during dialysis, a cardiac event, and administration of analgesic medications.
* Cardiac: The patient has a history of CAD and CABG, and his recent ECG shows mildly increased ST depressions, slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, and no CP or evidence of anginal equivalent. He has been started on ASA 325, Plavix 75, and Pravastatin 80.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support with a CMV/ASSIST mode, with a plateau pressure of 34 cmH2O and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His SpO2 is 99%.
* Renal: The patient has ESRD on HD and is scheduled for regular HD on M/W/F.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and unable to assess mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's recent MI and LV systolic failure may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and ventilator support may lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), respiratory failure, or aspiration.
* Renal complications: The patient's ESRD on HD may lead to further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, or sepsis.
* Infection: The patient's recent procedures and immunosuppressive medications may increase his risk of infection, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and recent procedures may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, or hemoptysis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Hold blood pressure medications (beta blocker, imdur) and give fluid boluses to keep SBP above 80 mmHg.
* Monitor mental status and wean sedation for extubation.
* Continue HD on regular schedule.
* Monitor lytes and continue sevelamer.
* Continue prednisone.
* Order active T&S.
* Continue home dose allopruinol, fluconazole, and citalopram.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch tall, 66.3 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. They underwent an emergent PCI procedure due to anterior ischemia, which was technically difficult. The patient became agitated in the cath lab and required endotracheal intubation. They are currently managed on invasive ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, with a set tidal volume of 350 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 79/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. They have also been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are at risk of developing respiratory failure due to the invasive ventilation and potential lung injury from the PCI procedure.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and they are at risk of developing cardiovascular instability due to the PCI procedure and potential cardiac complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is at risk of developing acute renal failure due to the PCI procedure and potential contrast-induced nephropathy.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive lines and potential lung injury from the PCI procedure.
5. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium and is at risk of developing further episodes of delirium due to the sedation and potential underlying medical conditions.
6. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the PCI procedure and potential anticoagulation therapy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications due to the sedation and potential underlying medical conditions."
