   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Assessment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP,
   atrial fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with
   leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b
   c.diff who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning
   for free air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Currently has leukocytosis, hypotensive, tachycardia.  Has
   many likely sources such as c.diff, blood (PICC in place), urine, PNA,
   but now with bowel perforation s/p colectommy and also with potentially
   a duodenoal perforation
   - Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 12-15
   - LR boluses to keep CVP up, also to improve UOP
   - cipro, flagyl IV.  also vanco IV for MRSA cellulitis.  Cannot do PO
   vanco right now given surgery and concern for duodenal perforation
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - repeat CXR
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60.  will also add vasopressin to help
   decrease norepinephrine dose which will only worsen tachycardia
   - serial abdominal exam; low threshold to d/w surgery for repeat look
   in abdomen if necessary
   - consider removal of PICC in AM
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   CXR with significant pulm edema and Right pleural effusion. ? left
   pleural effusion.  Likely partly secondary to pulmonary edema in the
   setting of RVR and significant MR.  Also, could be developing ARDS in
   the setting of perforated bowel.
   - currently not using ARDSnet settings
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: creatinine up to 1.4, but currently anuric post operatively.
   Likely mostly pre-renal.  [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN secondary to hypotension.
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - urine lytes if cr continues to go up
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cannot give PO vanco for now; cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #2 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - hold off on esmolol or dilt gtt as these can both cause hypotension
   - try vasopressive for BP and decrease norepinephrine as tolerated
   - consider dig loading
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC
   # PPx: hep sc, ppi IV
   # Code: FULL CODE
   # Dispo: ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   decrease norepinephrine dose which will only worsen tachycardia
   - serial abdominal exam; low threshold to d/w surgery for repeat look
   in abdomen if necessary

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 79-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a recent diagnosis of leukemia cutis/AML. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air, which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently suffering from severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and C. difficile infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.4°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 123 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 100/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Central venous pressure: 7 mmHg

The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, PICC line, and endotracheal tube. He is receiving various medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and sedatives.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 62.8 cells/μL
* Hematocrit: 35.9%
* Platelet count: 107 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 5.6 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Overweight/obese
* Endotracheal tube and OG tube in place
* Cardiovascular examination: normal heart sounds, no murmurs
* Peripheral vascular examination: diminished radial and dorsalis pedis pulses
* Respiratory/chest examination: symmetric expansion, crackles on left side
* Abdominal examination: distended, no bowel sounds present
* Neurological examination: sedated, unable to assess movement or tone

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure and potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury and potential development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* C. difficile infection and potential perforation of the colon
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and potential development of thromboembolic complications
* Leukemia cutis/AML with potential progression to leukemia

Based on the patient's condition, the plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and vasopressors as needed
* Maintaining central venous pressure between 12-15 mmHg
* Repeating CXR and serial abdominal exams
* Considering removal of PICC line and insertion of a new central line
* Monitoring electrolytes and adjusting medications as necessary
* Reassessing the patient's code status and disposition in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain and was found to have a perforated colon, which was treated with a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has multiple potential sources of sepsis, including C. difficile, blood (PICC line), urine, and pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.4°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 123 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 100/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 7 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 62.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 107 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.6 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Chest X-ray with significant pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion
* CT scan of the abdomen showing concern for free air

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* IV fluids to maintain CVP of 12-15 mmHg
* LR boluses to keep CVP up
* Antibiotics changed to vancomycin IV and PR, flagyl, and flucloxacillin
* Blood cultures (unable to obtain sputum and urine cultures)
* Repeat CT scan
* Follow-up surgery recommendations, possibly back to the operating room today
* Norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg
* Keep all lines for now with an unstable patient and no positive blood cultures
* Hct Q 8 hours
* Bladder pressures Q 4 hours per surgery recommendations
* Albumin 25 g per surgery today for volume

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation
* C. difficile colitis
* Pneumonia
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* Leukemia-related complications, including bleeding and infection
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and developed left thigh MRSA cellulitis, which progressed to acute abdominal pain with concern for free air and was subsequently treated with right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis. He is receiving pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg and has a lactate level of 4.5 mmol/L, indicating severe metabolic acidosis. He is also experiencing respiratory failure, with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and has a volume overload on his chest X-ray.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and PICC line, and is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulants. He is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and may progress to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Bowel perforation: The patient has a high risk of developing a second bowel perforation, which can lead to further complications and mortality.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further hypoxemia and hypercarbia.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is rising, and he is becoming anuric, which can lead to acute kidney injury and potential need for dialysis.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
6. Leukemia cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis can progress, leading to further skin and systemic complications.
7. C. diff: The patient's C. diff infection can worsen, leading to further complications and mortality.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis, and is at high risk of developing further complications, including bowel perforation, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, leukemia cutis, and C. diff infection. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 55 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a recent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute abdominal pain, suspected bowel perforation, and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.4°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 127 bpm
* Blood pressure: 99/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. He is also receiving respiratory support through invasive ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 62.8
* Hematocrit: 35.9%
* Platelet count: 107
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 4.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* LDH: 912 IU/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT scan: Severe rotation of the colon, with free air and fluid in the abdomen
* CXR: Volume overload, with bilateral infiltrates

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis: Due to suspected bowel perforation and c. diff, the patient is receiving antibiotics and vasopressors.
* Bowel perforation: The patient is at risk for a second bowel perforation, and a CT scan is planned to evaluate the extent of the damage.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation and has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient is becoming anuric and is receiving IV fluids to maintain a CVP of >15 mmHg.
* AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is receiving chemotherapy, and a bone marrow transplant is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis and organ failure if the bowel perforation is not managed promptly.
* Bowel perforation: The patient is at risk for a second bowel perforation, which can lead to further complications and mortality.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure if the invasive ventilation is not managed effectively.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for further renal failure if the IV fluids are not managed effectively.
* AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is at risk for further complications from the chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Sepsis
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff.  On 2
   pressors.  S/p surgery, but now with concerns for second bowel
   perforation discovered on scan after surgery performed.  Lactate 4.5.
   Other sources include line infection.
   - vanc/ceftaz/IV flagyl
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors/IVF to maintain MAP > 55
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery now with concerns for second perf.
   Also with bloody fluid being suctioned from ET tube
   - Abd/Chest CT this am
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.
   - ARDSnet
   - Advance ET tube 3cm
   - Consider R CT to improve ventilation.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine continues to rise.  Becoming anuric.
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - Renally dose meds
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #3 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Runs of SVT.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as left thigh MRSA cellulitis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to bowel perforation and C. difficile infection. He is receiving antibiotics and pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
2. Bowel perforation: The patient had a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, but a second bowel perforation was discovered on a post-operative scan. He is at risk for further complications, including peritonitis and abscess formation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation and volume overload reduction.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and he is becoming anuric. He is receiving IV fluids to maintain his central venous pressure (CVP) above 15 mmHg.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which may be contributing to his bowel perforation.
6. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is receiving treatment for his AML, and his white blood cell count is being monitored.
7. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which is being managed with rate control medications.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for:

* Elevated lactate levels (4.5 mmol/L)
* Elevated creatinine levels (1.4-1.7 mg/dL)
* Elevated white blood cell count (62.8-107 K/uL)
* Elevated platelet count (107-91 K/uL)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (22-35 mg/dL)
* Elevated serum glucose levels (142-130 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies are notable for:

* A severely rotated chest X-ray (CXR) with an endotracheal tube in the high position
* A CT scan showing a bowel perforation and concern for free air

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for sepsis and C. difficile infection
* Pressors to maintain blood pressure
* Mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure
* IV fluids to maintain CVP above 15 mmHg
* Renal dose medications to manage acute kidney injury
* Follow-up cultures and laboratory tests to monitor the patient's condition
* Consideration of surgery for bowel perforation and abscess formation
* Monitoring of the patient's AML/Leukemia cutis treatment and response"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and hospital course complicated by C. diff. He developed acute abdominal pain on 3/21 with CT concerning for free air and underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently on pressors and has a lactate level of 4.5. The patient has multiple medical issues, including sepsis, bowel perforation, respiratory failure, and anuria.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to bowel perforation caused by C. diff. and line infection. The patient's lactate level of 4.5 indicates a high level of inflammation, and the presence of pressors suggests that the patient's blood pressure is not stable.
2. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is a critical issue, and the presence of bloody fluid being suctioned from the ET tube suggests that the patient's condition is worsening. The patient's abdominal CT scan this morning will help determine the extent of the perforation, and surgery will be necessary to repair the perforation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's volume overload on CXR suggests that the patient's lungs are not able to expand properly, and the presence of ARDSnet indicates that the patient is at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Anuria: The patient's anuria is a critical issue, and the patient's creatinine level of 1.9 suggests that the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly. The patient's IVFs will need to be adjusted to keep the patient's CVP above 15, and the patient's medications will need to be renally dosed.
5. C. diff: The patient's C. diff infection is a critical issue, and the patient's IV flagyl will need to be continued to treat the infection. The patient's bloody stool suggests that the patient's infection is not responding to treatment, and the patient's abdominal CT scan this morning will help determine the extent of the infection.
6. AML/Leukemia Cutis: The patient's AML/leukemia cutis is a critical issue, and the patient's day 3 after dacogen completed indicates that the patient's treatment is not yet complete. The patient's follow-up counts will need to be monitored to ensure that the patient's leukemia is in remission.
7. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is a critical issue, and the patient's tachycardic heart rate of 130-150s suggests that the patient's heart is not functioning properly. The patient's repletion of lytes will need to be monitored to ensure that the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and the patient's pressors will need to be adjusted to ensure that the patient's blood pressure is stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors/IVF to maintain MAP > 55
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.  Also with bloody fluid being
   suctioned from ET tube this am
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - ARDSnet
   - Consider R CT to improve ventilation if necessary.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine continues to rise.  Becoming anuric.  Potassium
   rising.
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - Renally dose meds
   - Repeat lytes after surgery and consider HD/ CVVH in next 24 hrs.
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl / PR vanc / IVIG
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #3 after dacogen completed.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with acute abdominal pain and was found to have a perforated colon with c.diff infection. He underwent surgery twice, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and had an abscess drainage and anastomosis of a leak.

The patient's current condition is critical, with sepsis likely due to the bowel perforation and c.diff infection. He is receiving vanc/meropenem for sepsis, IV flagyl/PR vanc and IVIG for c.diff, and pressors/IVF to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 55. He has a rising lactate level and is receiving blood/urine/sputum cultures and follow-up cultures.

The patient has respiratory failure, with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, volume overload on CXR, and a loculated pleural effusion on the right side. He is receiving ARDSnet and is being considered for a right CT to improve ventilation if necessary.

The patient's creatinine is continuing to rise, and he is becoming anuric, with a rising potassium level. He is receiving IVFs to keep his central venous pressure (CVP) > 15, and his medications are being renally dosed. He will likely require hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in the next 24 hours.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is being treated with repletion of electrolytes and consideration of changing pressors if persistent arrhythmias occur.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the bowel perforation and c.diff infection.
2. Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the rising creatinine and anuria.
4. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium, due to the patient's rising potassium level.
5. Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
6. Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection, due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
7. Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the surgical site or gastrointestinal tract, due to the patient's coagulopathy and anticoagulation therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical condition, with a focus on preventing and treating potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and anastomosis of leak.
   # Sepsis
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff.  On 2
   pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Lactate rising.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl/PR vanc and IVIG for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors/IVF to maintain MAP > 55
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.  Also with bloody fluid being
   suctioned from ET tube this am
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - ARDSnet
   - Consider R CT to improve ventilation if necessary.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine continues to rise.  Becoming anuric.  Potassium
   rising.
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - Renally dose meds
   - Repeat lytes after surgery and consider HD
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl / PR vanc / IVIG
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #3 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Runs of SVT.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain with CT findings concerning for free air. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and later repeat surgery with abscess drainage and anastomosis of a leak. He is currently critically ill, requiring multiple pressors, and has developed sepsis, bowel perforation, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to bowel perforation caused by C. difficile. This can lead to multi-organ failure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation can lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure can worsen his condition, leading to respiratory arrest, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and potentially death.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's rising creatinine levels and anuria suggest acute kidney injury, which can lead to end-stage renal disease, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis can lead to severe colitis, perforation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen his condition, leading to heart failure, stroke, and potentially death.
7. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML can progress to acute myeloid leukemia, leading to life-threatening complications, including bleeding, infection, and organ failure.
8. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability, requiring multiple pressors, can lead to cardiovascular collapse, shock, and potentially death.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional deficiencies, including glycemic control and electrolyte imbalances, can worsen his condition, leading to organ failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
10. Infection: The patient's multiple lines, including arterial, multi-lumen, and PICC lines, increase his risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill, with multiple life-threatening complications, requiring close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further deterioration and potential death."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial
   fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia
   cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff
   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure.
   - blood and LR to goal CVP >= 15 given PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q6hrs
   -bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilatory settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords)
   - continue current vent settings.  Will not attempt to weane patient
   for now
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - s/p vitamin K on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**] but urine output increasing as of
   [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for worsening kidney function nad possible
   need for dialysis but appears to be improving.  Likely experienced ATN
   from hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
   - renal consult
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #4 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC
   # PPx: hep sc, ppi IV drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2157-3-22**] 11:15 AM
 OR SENT - At [**2157-3-22**] 02:17 PM
   -antibiotic cocktail now meropenem, IV and PR vanc (c. diff), flagyl,
   fluconazole.
   -bronchoscopy in a.m. b/c of concern for right lobar collapse.  No
   mucous plug seen on bronch but ETT tube was actually at level of vocal
   chords and right lung inflated better after tube advanced.
   -Had abdominal CT that showed extravasation of contrast in duodenum.
   Taken by surgery again to OR where an abscess was found and drained in
   the lesser sac and JP drains were placed around site of duodenal perf.
   The perf was not repaired because they were ""unable to mobilize the
   duodenum"" in a way that allowed for repair.  OR blood loss ~ 700cc and
   recieved 1u PRBC in OR and second unit on floor in evening.  Also got
   two bags of platelets for count of 42 and 2u FFP per surgery reccs.
   -around 2 a.m., got 2 more units of FFP, plt, blood for hct of 22
   -got CXR in evening per surgery's reccs. showed improved aeration of R
   lung.
   -BMT: patient is day 7 decitabine and counts should fall this week
   -cards: continue supportive care and tx'ing underlying sepsis
   -renal consulted in evening b/c oliguric during day but UOP picked up
   in evening so didn't do anything; will come by again on [**3-23**] to
   re-assess.

   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, admitted with leukemia cutis and AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff infection. He developed acute abdominal pain with CT scan showing free air, leading to right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk of further deterioration due to persistent sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He may require further ventilatory support and monitoring.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and active bleeding from JP drains. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and empirical treatment for DIC are necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney function is compromised, with oliguric phase and possible need for dialysis. Close monitoring of kidney function and electrolyte levels is essential.
5. C.diff Infection: The patient's C.diff infection may have contributed to the perforated colon and ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of C.diff symptoms and treatment are necessary.
6. AML/Leukemia Cutis: The patient's AML treatment may cause further bone marrow suppression and bleeding complications. Close monitoring of blood counts and platelet levels is essential.
7. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's tachycardia may worsen his hemodynamic status and increase the risk of cardiac complications. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and electrolyte levels is essential.

Recommendations:

1. Continue sepsis management with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation.
2. Monitor respiratory status closely and adjust ventilatory settings as necessary.
3. Manage coagulopathy with empirical treatment for DIC and close monitoring of coagulation parameters.
4. Monitor kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue C.diff treatment and monitor symptoms closely.
6. Monitor AML/Leukemia Cutis treatment and blood counts closely.
7. Monitor atrial fibrillation with RVR and adjust electrolyte levels as necessary.

The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and improve his overall condition."

   fluconazole.
   -bronchoscopy in a.m. b/c of concern for right lobar collapse.  No
   mucous plug seen on bronch but ETT tube was actually at level of vocal
   chords and right lung inflated better after tube advanced.
   -Had abdominal CT that showed extravasation of contrast in duodenum.
   Taken by surgery again to OR where an abscess was found and drained in
   the lesser sac and JP drains were placed around site of duodenal perf.
   The perf was not repaired because they were ""unable to mobilize the
   duodenum"" in a way that allowed for repair.  OR blood loss ~ 700cc and
   recieved 1u PRBC in OR and second unit on floor in evening.  Also got
   two bags of platelets for count of 42 and 2u FFP per surgery reccs.
   -around 2 a.m., got 2 more units of FFP, plt, blood for hct of 22
   -got CXR in evening per surgery's reccs. showed improved aeration of R
   lung.
   -BMT: patient is day 7 decitabine and counts should fall this week
   -cards: continue supportive care and tx'ing underlying sepsis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP,
   atrial fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with
   leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b
   c.diff who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning
   for free air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2157-3-22**] 08:00 AM
 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2157-3-22**] 11:15 AM
 OR SENT - At [**2157-3-22**] 02:17 PM
   -antibiotic cocktail now meropenem, IV and PR vanc (c. diff), flagyl,
   fluconazole.
   -bronchoscopy in a.m. b/c of concern for right lobar collapse.  No
   mucous plug seen on bronch but ETT tube was actually at level of vocal
   chords and right lung inflated better after tube advanced.
   -Had abdominal CT that showed extravasation of contrast in duodenum.
   Taken by surgery again to OR where an abscess was found and drained in
   the lesser sac and JP drains were placed around site of duodenal perf.
   The perf was not repaired because they were ""unable to mobilize the
   duodenum"" in a way that allowed for repair.  OR blood loss ~ 700cc and
   recieved 1u PRBC in OR and second unit on floor in evening.  Also got
   two bags of platelets for count of 42 and 2u FFP per surgery reccs.
   -around 2 a.m., got 2 more units of FFP, plt, blood for hct of 22
   -got CXR in evening per surgery's reccs. showed improved aeration of R
   lung.
   -BMT: patient is day 7 decitabine and counts should fall this week
   -cards: continue supportive care and tx'ing underlying sepsis
   -renal consulted in evening b/c oliguric during day but UOP picked up
   in evening so didn't do anything; will come by again on [**3-23**] to
   re-assess.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain and was found to have free air on CT scan, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple potential sources of sepsis, including c.diff, blood, urine, and PNA. He is currently receiving antibiotics and has been anuric with just 20cc of urine output since admission.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and significant pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR. He may be developing ARDS secondary to perforated bowel.
3. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4 and is anuric post-operatively, likely due to pre-renal azotemia. He may develop ATN secondary to hypotension and pressors.
4. C.diff: The patient has a history of c.diff and may have perforated colon as a result.
5. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient has AML and is at risk for bleeding and infection.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR and is at risk for stroke and cardiac arrest.
7. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk for further decline in renal function.
8. Gastrointestinal Perforation: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal perforation and is at risk for further complications, including peritonitis and abscess formation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Sepsis: IV fluids to goal CVP 12-15, LR boluses to keep CVP up, and antibiotics changed to Vanco IV and PR, flagyl, and fluconazole.
2. Respiratory Failure: CXR with significant pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, consider chest tube PRN, bronch today, and push in ETT 2 cm today.
3. Coagulopathy/DIC: IVFs to keep CVP>15, monitor lytes, and dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable.
4. C.diff: Cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now, and surgery following.
5. AML/Leukemia cutis: tx to keep HCT>30 for now, tx to keep plts >50K, and BMT recs.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Hold nodal agents for now, no amio for now, and consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed by amio gtt if becomes acutely unstable.
7. Acute Kidney Injury: IVFs to keep CVP>15, monitor lytes, and dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable.
8. Gastrointestinal Perforation: Consider surgery following, and monitor for signs of peritonitis and abscess formation."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl and IVIG for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 55
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC as needed
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to platelets from
   chemo.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Runs of SVT.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and developed acute abdominal pain on day 3 with computed tomography (CT) concerning for free air. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and was found to have a second perforation, which was drained via abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak. The patient has developed sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory failure, and is receiving vasopressors and antibiotics. He also has coagulopathy, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and chemotherapy, and is at risk for further bleeding. The patient's creatinine and potassium levels are stable, and his urine output is improving. He is also at risk for further complications, including c. difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, and stress ulceration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to the bowel perforation and is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the bowel perforation and the volume overload on his chest CT. He is at risk for further respiratory compromise.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to DIC and chemotherapy, and he is at risk for further bleeding.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient's c. difficile infection is likely due to the antibiotics he has received and is at risk for further complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is at risk for further complications, including stroke and heart failure.
6. Stress Ulceration: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration due to his critical illness and is receiving prophylactic therapy.
7. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is at risk for further complications, including peritonitis and abscess formation.
8. Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis is at risk for further progression and is at risk for complications, including bleeding and infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors as ordered.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Continue c. difficile infection therapy as ordered.
5. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis as ordered.
7. Monitor the patient's bowel perforation status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's leukemia cutis status closely and adjust therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl and IVIG for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 55
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC as needed
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to platelets from
   chemo.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Runs of SVT.
   - Replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a history of duodenal ulcer s/p surgery. He was admitted with acute abdominal pain and was found to have a second duodenal perforation, which required repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is on two pressors and has a history of bowel perforation, which is likely the cause of his sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a volume overload on CXR and a loculated pleural effusion on the right side.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has likely developed DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) due to his chemotherapy and has additional hits to his platelets from chemo.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient has had two surgeries for bowel perforation and has drains placed in the leak.
5. C. diff: The patient has a history of C. diff and is currently being treated with IV flagyl.
6. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is on day 4 after dacogen completion and is awaiting a bone marrow transplant.
7. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with lytes and consideration for changing pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Worsening sepsis and septic shock
2. Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
3. Coagulopathy and bleeding complications
4. Bowel obstruction or perforation
5. C. diff colitis and diarrhea
6. Leukemia relapse or progression
7. Atrial fibrillation and stroke

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
2. IV flagyl and IVIG for C. diff
3. F/U cultures
4. Pressors to maintain MAP > 55
5. F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
6. Follow fever curve
7. PRBC as needed

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition plan is not specified in the note.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are not specified in the note.
3. Lines: The patient has an arterial line, multi-lumen line, PICC line, and 20-gauge line.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with boots and SQ UF heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI gtt."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain. He underwent two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, bowel perforation, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of septic shock and multi-organ failure due to the presence of multiple antibiotics and pressors.
2. Bowel Perforation: The patient has a high risk of further bowel perforation and subsequent sepsis, given his history of c. diff and recent surgeries.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of further respiratory compromise due to his underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the presence of a loculated pleural effusion on the right side.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine is rising, and he is becoming anuric, indicating a high risk of acute kidney injury.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are rising, and he is at risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is persistent, and he is at risk of developing further arrhythmias, particularly if his electrolytes are not repleted.
7. C. Difficile: The patient is at risk of further c. difficile infections, given his recent antibiotic use and history of c. diff.
8. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is progressing, and he is at risk of developing further complications, such as bleeding or infection.
9. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to his prolonged immobility and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
10. Venous Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to his immobility and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 55
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed. LR for now as pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to platelets from
   chemo.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 60 minutes
   Patient is critically ill, family updated<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with acute abdominal pain and was found to have a second duodenal perforation, requiring repeat surgery with abscess drainage.

The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, with a lactate trending down after the second surgery. He is on two pressors, norepinephrine and fentanyl, and is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, for sepsis. He also has respiratory failure, with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and is on a ventilator with a FiO2 of 60%. His chest CT shows complete collapse of the right lung and a loculated pleural effusion on the right.

The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and chemotherapy. He is receiving platelet transfusions and fresh frozen plasma as needed. He also has bowel perforation, with serial Hcts and follow-up of bladder pressures.

Other issues include C. difficile colitis, which may have caused the perforated colon, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has resolved after surgery. He is also experiencing acute kidney injury, with a creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, and is receiving hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: worsening of sepsis, development of multi-organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: further deterioration of lung function, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and increased risk of mortality.
3. Coagulopathy: worsening of bleeding, development of hemorrhagic shock, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Bowel perforation: further perforation, development of peritonitis, and increased risk of mortality.
5. C. difficile colitis: worsening of colitis, development of toxic megacolon, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Atrial fibrillation: development of cardiac arrhythmias, worsening of heart failure, and increased risk of mortality.
7. Acute kidney injury: worsening of kidney function, development of acute kidney failure, and increased risk of mortality.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure.
   - blood and LR to goal CVP >= 15 given PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q6hrs
   -bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilatory settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords)
   - continue current vent settings.  Will not attempt to weane patient
   for now
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - s/p vitamin K on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**] but urine output increasing as of
   [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for worsening kidney function nad possible
   need for dialysis but appears to be improving.  Likely experienced ATN
   from hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
   - renal consult
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #4 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC
   # PPx: hep sc, ppi IV drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on ventilatory support with a CXR showing pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, and may be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated bowel. He is currently on stable ventilatory settings.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and is receiving norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain a MAP of 60. His blood pressure is 84/48 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has a CVP of 14 mmHg and is receiving blood and LR to goal CVP of 15.
* Coagulation: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and elevated FDPs, and is being treated empirically for DIC.
* Renal: The patient was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**] but urine output is increasing as of [**2157-3-23**]. He is at risk for worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis.
* Infectious: The patient has c.diff and is being treated with IV flagyl and PR Vanco. He also has MRSA cellulitis and is being treated with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury, respiratory failure)
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding
* Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response)
* Infection-related complications (e.g. sepsis, c.diff)
* Gastrointestinal complications (e.g. perforated bowel, ileus)
* Renal failure requiring dialysis
* Cardiovascular complications (e.g. cardiogenic shock)

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for c.diff and MRSA cellulitis
* Blood and LR to goal CVP of 15
* Norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain a MAP of 60
* Empirical treatment for DIC
* Renal consult and IVFs to keep CVP >15
* Monitoring of electrolytes and creatinine
* Dose adjustment of vancomycin based on creatinine level
* Follow-up with oncology and cardiology services
* Continued respiratory support and monitoring of vital signs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed
   in lesser sac (JP2 is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is
   intermediate, and JP3 is deepest).
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60 but will attempt to
   wean vasopressin per surgery
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q6hrs
   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - mild alkalemia on ABG this a.m. so will decrease RR, keep Vt at
   550cc, and recheck ABG
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery, though oncology
   prefers transfusion for Hct>27
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute tubular necrosis, and C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressure is still hypotensive, and he is receiving two pressors. He may require further interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further adjustments to his ventilator settings. The development of ARDS is a concern, and the patient may require invasive mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters are abnormal, and he is at risk for further bleeding. He may require further transfusions and empiric treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis: The patient's kidney function is still compromised, and he may require further management with dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient's C. difficile infection is ongoing, and he may require further treatment with antibiotics and other measures to control the infection.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is ongoing, and he may require further management with anti-arrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
7. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is ongoing, and he may require further treatment with chemotherapy or other therapies to manage the disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his pressor therapy as needed.
2. Adjust the patient's ventilator settings to optimize his respiratory status and prevent further respiratory failure.
3. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with transfusions and empiric treatment for DIC.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his management accordingly.
5. Continue to manage the patient's C. difficile infection with antibiotics and other measures.
6. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with anti-arrhythmic medications or cardioversion as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's leukemia cutis/AML and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   - Bronch with airway inspection today
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* He has undergone two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and has been diagnosed with bowel perforation, c.diff infection, and possible DIC.
* He is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants, and is being monitored for sepsis, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and bowel perforation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis/Hypotension:** The patient's sepsis is likely due to bowel perforation and c.diff infection, and he is being treated with vasopressors. There is a risk of further deterioration in his condition if the infection is not effectively managed.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely related to his underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory decline if the patient's condition does not improve.
3. **Coagulopathy:** The patient has likely developed DIC, which is a serious condition that can lead to bleeding and other complications. Monitoring of coagulation studies and administration of clotting factors will be necessary to manage this condition.
4. **Bowel Perforation:** The patient has undergone surgery to repair the bowel perforation, but there is a risk of further complications, including infection and abscess formation.
5. **C.diff Infection:** The patient has been diagnosed with c.diff infection, which is a serious condition that can lead to further complications, including perforated colon and sepsis.
6. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can lead to further complications, including stroke and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. **Leukemia Cutis/AML:** The patient has ongoing leukemia cutis/AML, which can lead to further complications, including bone marrow failure and bleeding.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as necessary to manage his sepsis, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, bowel perforation, c.diff infection, and atrial fibrillation.
* Consider adding caspofungin to the patient's antibiotic regimen to cover for possible fungal infections.
* Continue to follow the patient's laboratory values, including coagulation studies, and administer clotting factors as necessary to manage his coagulopathy.
* Monitor the patient's bowel output and adjust his fluid management accordingly to prevent further complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid management accordingly to prevent further complications.
* Consider consulting with infectious disease and hematology specialists to further manage the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA cellulitis, c. diff, and bowel perforation, which increases the risk of developing sepsis. The patient is already on two pressors and has a falling Hct, which may indicate ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely due to volume overload and loculated pleural effusion. Weaning FiO2 and correcting alkalosis may be necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of DIC and is at risk of further bleeding due to the ongoing chemotherapy and surgical drains. Monitoring DIC labs and administering platelets, FFP, and cryoprecipitate as needed may be necessary.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient has already undergone two surgeries to address bowel perforation, and further surgery may be necessary to manage the ongoing leak.
5. C. diff: The patient has c. diff, which may be contributing to the patient's ongoing abdominal pain and bleeding.
6. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient has AML and leukemia cutis, which may be affecting the patient's blood counts and increasing the risk of bleeding and infection.
7. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac complications.
8. Somnolence: The patient is sedated, and weaning off sedation may be necessary to assess the patient's neurological status.
9. Nutritional Deficits: The patient is critically ill and may be at risk of nutritional deficits, which may require aggressive nutritional support.
10. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a history of volume overload and electrolyte imbalances, which may require careful monitoring and management.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring and managing these potential complications closely to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 55
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed. LR for now as pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to platelets from
   chemo.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer s/p surgery. He has been admitted with acute abdominal pain and was found to have bowel perforation, which led to sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs:
	+ Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
	+ Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
	+ Blood pressure: 99/54 mmHg
	+ Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
	+ Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count: 23.2 x 10^9/L
	+ Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 107 x 10^9/L
	+ Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
	+ Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
	+ Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
	+ Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
	+ LDH: 607 IU/L
* Imaging results:
	+ CXR: Rotated, volume loss on right, ET tube in good position, bilateral effusions, and bilateral airspace disease
	+ CT: Concerning for free air and bowel perforation
* Medical issues:
	+ Sepsis/hypotension: Most likely due to bowel perforation
	+ Respiratory failure: Hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
	+ Coagulopathy: Likely DIC with additional hit to platelets from chemo
	+ Bowel perforation: S/p surgery
	+ C. difficile: Possibly cause of perforated colon
	+ AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed
	+ Atrial fibrillation with RVR: On arrival, very tachycardic to 130-150s; now in NSR after surgery

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis/hypotension: Continued sepsis and hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory failure: Prolonged respiratory failure can lead to respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia.
* Coagulopathy: Continued coagulopathy can lead to bleeding complications and organ failure.
* Bowel perforation: Continued bowel perforation can lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
* C. difficile: Continued C. difficile infection can lead to recurrent diarrhea, colitis, and sepsis.
* AML/Leukemia cutis: Continued AML/Leukemia cutis can lead to bone marrow failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding complications.
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Continued atrial fibrillation with RVR can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 55 mmHg
* IV antibiotics for sepsis
* Consider adding caspofungin for sepsis
* IV flagyl for C. difficile
* F/U cultures
* Pressors to maintain MAP > 55 mmHg
* F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
* Follow fever curve
* PRBC/plts as needed
* Surgery following
* Serial Hcts
* Follow bladder pressures
* Hold on CVVHD for now
* IV flagyl
* No IVIG at this time
* Follow counts
* BMT following
* Replete lytes
* If persistent arrhythmias, consider change pressors

The patient's current condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   - Bronch with airway inspection today
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with acute abdominal pain, which was found to be due to bowel perforation and c. difficile infection. He has undergone two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and has developed a leak.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is on two pressors and has had two surgeries. His lactate levels are trending down, but he is still experiencing falling hemoglobin and serosanguinous fluid from his abdominal drains.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and volume overload on his chest X-ray. He has a loculated pleural effusion on the right side and is on 50% FiO2.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has likely developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to his chemotherapy and bone marrow suppression. He is experiencing bloody output from his surgical drains.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient has had two surgeries to repair his bowel perforation, and he will likely require further surgery.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated with IV flagyl, but is not tolerating the medication.
6. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is on day 4 of his chemotherapy regimen and will require further treatment.
7. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's heart rate has normalized after his surgery, but he will require close monitoring for persistent arrhythmias.
8. Somnolence: The patient is sedated, but will have his sedation weaned off soon.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 107,000/uL
* White blood cell count: 23.2/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 607 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Volume loss on the right side, with an endotracheal tube in good position and bilateral effusions and airspace disease.
* CT scan: Complete collapse of the right lung, with a loculated pleural effusion on the right side.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing treatment for sepsis with vancomycin and meropenem
* Adding caspofungin to his antibiotic regimen
* Administering IV flagyl for c. difficile infection
* Following up on cultures and monitoring his fever curve
* Weaning his FiO2 as tolerated
* Correcting his alkalosis
* Performing bronchoscopy to inspect his airway
* Following up on his coagulopathy with platelet transfusions and cryoprecipitate as needed
* Monitoring his bowel perforation and considering further surgery
* Following up on his AML/leukemia cutis with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation
* Monitoring his atrial fibrillation with RVR and considering changes to his pressors
* Weaning his sedation off soon."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed
   in lesser sac (JP2 is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is
   intermediate, and JP3 is deepest).  Weaned off vasopressin on [**2157-3-24**].
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60 but will attempt to wean
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q8hrs
   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable (Increasing dose to
   q12h from q24h)
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing concerning free air and subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following medical issues:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is septic with a likely source of infection being bowel perforation. He has required levophed and vasopressin, and his blood pressure and urine output are being monitored.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is being treated with mechanical ventilation. He also has pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on his CXR.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and elevated FDPs, which is being treated with blood and platelet transfusions.
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has ATN with muddy brown casts in his urine, which is likely related to hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis.
5. Clostridioides difficile (C.diff): The patient has C.diff, which is being treated with IV flagyl and PR vancomycin.
6. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)/Leukemia Cutis: The patient has AML/leukemia cutis, which is being treated with chemotherapy and blood transfusions.
7. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with norepinephrine and beta-blockers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ATN can worsen, leading to acute kidney injury.
5. C.diff colitis: The patient's C.diff can lead to colitis, which can worsen his septic shock and respiratory failure.
6. Leukemia relapse: The patient's AML/leukemia cutis can relapse, leading to further complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR can lead to cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for his septic shock and C.diff.
2. Blood and platelet transfusions: The patient is receiving blood and platelet transfusions to treat his coagulopathy.
3. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to treat his respiratory failure.
4. Norepinephrine: The patient is receiving norepinephrine to treat his septic shock.
5. Chemotherapy: The patient is receiving chemotherapy for his AML/leukemia cutis.
6. Blood pressure management: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
7. Renal function monitoring: The patient's renal function is being monitored to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed
   in lesser sac (JP2 is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is
   intermediate, and JP3 is deepest).
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60 but will attempt to
   wean vasopressin per surgery
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q6hrs
   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - mild alkalemia on ABG this a.m. so will decrease RR, keep Vt at
   550cc, and recheck ABG
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery, though oncology

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has developed septic shock, likely due to bowel perforation, and is at risk of further complications such as multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and elevated FDPs, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Empirical treatment for DIC is being considered.
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has ATN with muddy brown casts in urine, which may indicate worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis.
5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a history of C. diff infection, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and may require further treatment.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may require further management to prevent complications.
7. Leukemia cutis/AML: The patient has leukemia cutis and AML, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
8. Cytopenia: The patient has cytopenia, which may require further transfusions and support.
9. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may require further management and support.
10. Abdominal distension: The patient has abdominal distension, which may indicate bowel obstruction or other complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following are the recommended interventions:

1. Continue to manage the patient's septic shock with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
3. Continue to treat the patient's coagulopathy with blood products and empirically with DIC treatment.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's C. diff infection with antibiotics and monitor for signs of improvement.
6. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider further management if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's leukemia cutis and AML and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to provide transfusions and support for the patient's cytopenia.
9. Monitor the patient's hypotension and adjust treatment as necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's abdominal distension and consider further evaluation and management if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
    # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.( nearly 1.7L)
   - Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (off vasopressin, still on levo)
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Somnolence: Likely [**3-7**] toxic-metabolic encelopathy.  Sedation off,
   will follow.  Too unstable to transport to head CT and low suspicion
   for focal intracranial process.
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   Other issues per Resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently in the ICU due to severe sepsis, respiratory failure, and bowel perforation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.4°F (39.1°C)
* Heart rate: 90 bpm
* Blood pressure: 106/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate

The patient has undergone two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and has had abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak. The patient is currently receiving vasopressors and has a falling hematocrit and serosanguinous fluid coming out of abdominal drains.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with:

* White blood cell count: 16.3
* Hematocrit: 22.7
* Platelet count: 37
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 502 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are concerning, with a CXR showing volume overload and a chest CT showing complete collapse of the right lung.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis/hypotension: likely due to bowel perforation
* Respiratory failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
* Somnolence: likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
* Coagulopathy: likely due to DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from chemotherapy
* Bowel perforation: s/p surgery
* C. diff: possibly causing perforated colon
* AML/Leukemia cutis: day #4 after dacogen completed
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
* IV flagyl for C. diff
* F/U cultures
* Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
* F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
* Follow fever curve
* PRBC/plts as needed
* LR/albumin for now as pressor need continues to drop

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: IV nutrition
* Glycemic control: insulin
* Lines: arterial line, multi-lumen line, and midline line
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
    # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   - Bronch with airway inspection today
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male admitted with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, and leukemia cutis/AML, who developed acute abdominal pain and was found to have a bowel perforation, MRSA cellulitis, and c. diff infection. The patient has undergone two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and has been treated with antibiotics and pressors.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaO2 of 166, and PaCO2 of 48.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is on two pressors, norepinephrine and heparin, and has a blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has a central venous pressure of 8 mmHg and a total fluid balance of 45 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 4.1 mEq/L.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a bowel perforation and has undergone two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.
* Infectious: The patient has a c. diff infection and is being treated with IV flagyl.
* Hematological: The patient has a falling hematocrit level and is being transfused with packed red blood cells and platelets as needed.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a c. diff infection and a bowel perforation, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a bleeding disorder and is at risk of developing a coagulopathy.
* Bowel perforation: The patient has a bowel perforation and is at risk of developing a peritonitis or abscess.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is at risk of developing a stroke or cardiac arrest.
* Leukemia cutis: The patient has leukemia cutis and is at risk of developing a skin rash or infection.
* DIC: The patient has a bleeding disorder and is at risk of developing a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for the c. diff infection
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the FiO2 and PEEP as needed
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust the pressors as needed
* Monitor the patient's renal status and adjust the fluid balance as needed
* Monitor the patient's hematological status and transfuse as needed
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust the sedation as needed
* Consider adding caspofungin to the antibiotic regimen
* Consider adding IV flagyl to the antibiotic regimen
* Follow the patient's counts and consider a bone marrow transplant if necessary
* Follow the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust the fluids as needed
* Consider changing the pressors if the patient's arrhythmias persist."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
    # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (off vasopressin, still on levo)
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Somnolence: Likely [**3-7**] toxic-metabolic encelopathy.  Sedation off,
   will follow.  Too unstable to transport to head CT and low suspicion
   for focal intracranial process.
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   Other issues per Resident note.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a recent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is on two pressors and has a falling Hct and serosangunous fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a volume overload on CXR and a loculated pleural effusion on the right side.
3. Somnolence: The patient is likely experiencing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, and sedation has been stopped.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a likely diagnosis of DIC, with bloody output from surgical drains.
5. Bowel Perforation: The patient has a recent history of bowel perforation and has undergone surgery.
6. C. diff: The patient has a diagnosis of C. diff and is being treated with IV flagyl.
7. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is on day 4 after dacogen completion and is awaiting bone marrow transplant.
8. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient was tachycardic on arrival but has since converted to NSR.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
* IV flagyl for C. diff
* Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
* F/U cultures
* Follow fever curve
* PRBC/plts as needed
* LR/albumin for pressor need

The patient's labs show:

* WBC: 16.3
* Hct: 22.7
* Plt: 37
* Cr: 1.3
* TCO2: 30
* Glucose: 120

The patient's imaging studies include a CXR showing volume overload and a chest CT with complete collapse of the right lung.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is at risk for further complications, including:

* Sepsis/hypotension
* Respiratory failure
* Coagulopathy
* Bowel perforation
* C. diff
* AML/Leukemia cutis
* Atrial Fibrillation with RVR

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his various complications, as well as ongoing treatment and management of his underlying conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed
   in lesser sac (JP2 is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is
   intermediate, and JP3 is deepest).  Weaned off vasopressin on [**2157-3-24**].
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60 but will attempt to wean

   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable (Increasing dose to
   q12h from q24h)
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and acute abdominal pain. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU with septic shock, likely due to bowel perforation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.4°F (39.1°C)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm
* Blood pressure: 92/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 16.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 46
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113 mg/dL

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He is also on several medications, including vancomycin, flagyl, and fluconazole.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, crackles in bilateral lung fields
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no bowel sounds
* Extremities: Right and left radial pulses are not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to verbal stimuli, no movement or tone assessment

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently on stable ventilator settings. The patient's coagulopathy is characterized by elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and active bleeding from JP drains.

The patient's kidney function is impaired, with muddy brown casts in urine and a history of oliguria. He is at risk for worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely due to sepsis and postoperative status. He is not anticoagulated, and cardioversion is not indicated at this time.

The patient's nutrition is being managed with TPN without lipids. His glycemic control is being monitored, and his lines are being managed with arterial and central venous access.

The patient's access is managed with a right internal jugular line, left axillary a-line, and left PICC.

The patient's disposition is ICU care, and his code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy.
2. Worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis.
3. Respiratory failure, including hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
4. Coagulopathy, including bleeding from JP drains and possible need for transfusions.
5. Atrial fibrillation, including risk of embolic events.
6. Leukemia cutis/AML, including risk of bleeding and infection.
7. Bowel perforation, including risk of peritonitis and abscess formation.
8. C. difficile infection, including risk of recurrence and complications.
9. Nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Medication-related complications, including adverse reactions to antibiotics and other medications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though vasopressin now off (as of
   [**3-24**]) and levophed being weaned.    Currently has leukocytosis,
   hypotensive on pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p colectomy and
   re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal perforation.  Also
   had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed in lesser sac (JP2
   is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is intermediate, and JP3 is
   deepest).
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60 but will continue to wean
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc; d/c
d vanc PR
   given absence of significant colitis on colon path
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q8hrs
   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable (Increasing dose to
   q12h from q24h)
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and acute abdominal pain. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and later developed septic shock, likely due to bowel perforation. He also has respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and C. difficile infection.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Fever: 102.4°F (39.1°C)
* Blood pressure: 92/56 mmHg
* Heart rate: 101 bpm
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* WBC count: 16.3 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 26.6%
* Platelet count: 46 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* INR: 1.6
* Fibrinogen: 437 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 441 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely due to bowel perforation, and he requires ongoing management with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, and his CXR shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. He may be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated bowel.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in his abdomen. He may have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and empiric treatment is being considered.
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts in his urine, and his urine output is increasing. He may have experienced ATN due to hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis.
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient has C. difficile infection, which may be the cause of his perforated colon.
6. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is ongoing, and he is receiving chemotherapy.
7. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may be due to his sepsis and post-operative state.
8. FEN (Fever, Neutropenia, and End-organ dysfunction): The patient has fever, neutropenia, and end-organ dysfunction, which may be related to his sepsis and underlying leukemia.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation for septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider bronchoscopy to assess lung aeration.
3. Continue coagulation factor replacement and platelet transfusions to manage coagulopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue antibiotics for C. difficile infection and consider surgery.
6. Continue chemotherapy for leukemia cutis/AML.
7. Manage atrial fibrillation with RVR with anti-arrhythmic medications and consider cardioversion if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's FEN and consider adjusting treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis and acute abdominal pain, which was found to be due to a perforated colon. He underwent surgery and developed a c.diff infection, which is thought to be the cause of the perforated colon. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. He is also receiving pressors for hypotension and has a coagulopathy likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to his c.diff infection and perforated colon. This could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if his FiO2 is not weaned as tolerated, and he may require further interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen if his DIC is not managed effectively, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is a high-risk condition that could lead to peritonitis, abscesses, and sepsis if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. C.diff Infection: The patient's c.diff infection is likely to persist if not managed effectively with antibiotics, which could lead to further complications such as perforation and sepsis.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not managed effectively with anticoagulation and rate control, which could lead to stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.
7. Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis is likely to worsen if not managed effectively with chemotherapy and supportive care, which could lead to further complications such as bleeding, infection, and organ failure.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his various medical issues. He is at high risk of developing further complications, and prompt and effective management is essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He developed acute abdominal pain on day 3 of admission, which was later confirmed to be a perforated gastric ulcer with abscess. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and was diagnosed with septic shock, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He also has a history of leukemia cutis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Current Status:

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, and fluconazole. He is also receiving norepinephrine for septic shock, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored. His platelet count is low, and he is receiving platelet transfusions as needed. His kidney function is improving, but he remains at risk for further kidney damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a major concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including organ failure and death.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is a major concern, and he is at risk for further kidney damage and potentially permanent kidney failure.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's DIC is a major concern, and he is at risk for further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis is a major concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including skin lesions and potentially life-threatening infections.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a major concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including stroke and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a major concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including hemorrhagic shock and potentially life-threatening bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current status is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his septic shock, acute kidney injury, and DIC. He also requires further evaluation and management of his leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. His gastrointestinal bleeding is also a major concern, and he requires close monitoring and management of his bleeding.

The plan is to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results, and to adjust his management accordingly. He will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his blood pressure will be closely monitored. His platelet count will be monitored, and he will receive platelet transfusions as needed. His kidney function will be closely monitored, and he will receive further evaluation and management as needed. His leukemia cutis will be further evaluated and managed, and his atrial fibrillation will be closely monitored and managed. His respiratory failure will be further evaluated and managed, and his gastrointestinal bleeding will be closely monitored and managed."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though vasopressin now off (as of
   [**3-24**]) and levophed being weaned.    Currently has leukocytosis,
   hypotensive on pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p colectomy and
   re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal perforation.  Also
   had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed in lesser sac (JP2
   is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is intermediate, and JP3 is
   deepest).
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60 but will continue to wean
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc; d/c
d vanc PR
   given absence of significant colitis on colon path
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q8hrs
   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   #Coagulation:
   meet parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high
   risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable (Increasing dose to
   q12h from q24h)
    # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
    # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain with CT findings concerning for free air. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and later developed septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (ATN).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient is at risk of developing further complications from septic shock, including organ dysfunction, hypotension, and death.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He may require further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. **Acute Kidney Injury (ATN):** The patient's ATN is likely due to hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis. He may require further interventions, such as dialysis, to manage his kidney function.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient is at risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to his sepsis and ATN. He may require empirical treatment with blood products and anticoagulants.
5. **C. difficile Infection:** The patient's C. difficile infection may be contributing to his perforated colon and septic shock. He may require further treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.
6. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation may be contributing to his tachycardia and hypotension. He may require further treatment with antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
7. **Leukemia Cutis/AML:** The patient's leukemia cutis/AML may be contributing to his septic shock and ATN. He may require further treatment with chemotherapy and supportive care.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to manage the patient's septic shock with vasopressors and fluids.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or ECMO.
3. Manage the patient's ATN with dialysis and supportive care.
4. Empirically treat the patient's coagulopathy with blood products and anticoagulants.
5. Continue to treat the patient's C. difficile infection with antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
7. Continue to manage the patient's leukemia cutis/AML with chemotherapy and supportive care.

**ICU Care:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely.
2. Provide supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
3. Continue to manage the patient's access, including arterial and central venous lines.
4. Communicate with the patient's wife and other healthcare providers as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
     # Sepsis/hypotension
   - Cont require pressors MPA >60 though making significant progress
   weaning
   - Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff
   - cont vanc/meropenem empiric sepsis - tailor regimen as cx data
   becomes available
   - cont IV flagyl for c. diff
    #AML/Leukemia cutis
   - Following counts
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   - BMT following
    # Respiratory Failure
   - hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   - Volume overload on CXR
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
    #Somnolence
   - significantly improved after weaning sedation
   - alert, following commands.
    #Coagulopathy:
   - Improving
   - Presumed [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from chemo.
   Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
    #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial hcts
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
   #ATN
   -RF improving

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and subsequent complications including bowel perforation, acute abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone multiple surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, as well as abscess drainage and drain placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.4°F, heart rate 115 bpm, blood pressure 98/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 0 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%.
* Laboratory results: Hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 13.8, platelet count 49, and creatinine 1.2 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is overweight/obese, with symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is requiring pressors and has a high likelihood of bowel perforation due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.
* AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient's blood counts are being monitored, and PRBCs and platelets are being transfused as needed.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and is requiring mechanical ventilation.
* Somnolence: The patient is alert and following commands, but was previously sedated.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a presumed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and is at risk for bleeding due to the presence of bloody output from surgical drains.
* Bowel perforation: The patient has a history of bowel perforation and is at risk for further complications.
* C. diff: The patient has a C. diff infection and is being treated with IV metronidazole.
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal function is improving, and medications are being adjusted for glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with rate control and possible consideration of antiarrhythmic therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued empiric therapy for sepsis with vancomycin and meropenem.
* Transfusion of PRBCs and platelets as needed.
* Monitoring of blood counts and coagulation studies.
* Serial hct and follow-up of bladder pressures.
* Surgical follow-up for bowel perforation.
* Adjustments to medications for GFR.
* Consideration of antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation.
* Continued mechanical ventilation and weaning as tolerated.
* Close monitoring of the patient's condition and adjustment of therapy as needed."

   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
Presumed secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess
   though also in the context of active C diff infection.  Despite
   persistent fevers, patient has done well as we have continued to wean
   pressors and he has become more responsive.   Still concern for
   remaining closed space infection.
   -wean off norepinephrine as tolerated (MAP>60)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis and AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c. difficile infection. He developed acute abdominal pain with a CT scan showing free air and was subsequently undergone right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 129 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 124/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient has a large post-operative wound with oozing of blood, which is concerning in the context of anemia and thrombocytopenia. He is also at risk for developing ARDS due to perforated bowel.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.6-9.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 32-63 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 350 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole, and is being treated for DIC with blood and fresh frozen plasma transfusions. He is also receiving TPN and IV fluids to maintain adequate hydration.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to his underlying infections, including MRSA cellulitis and c. difficile infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions, including perforated bowel and sepsis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for developing coagulopathy due to his underlying conditions, including DIC and thrombocytopenia.
4. ARDS: The patient is at risk for developing ARDS due to perforated bowel and sepsis.
5. Kidney injury: The patient is at risk for developing kidney injury due to his underlying conditions, including sepsis and hypoperfusion.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying conditions, including perforated bowel and sepsis.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for developing cardiac complications due to his underlying conditions, including atrial fibrillation and sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat underlying infections.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to assess for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy.
3. Consider empiric treatment for DIC and ARDS.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and consider prophylactic measures to prevent bleeding.
6. Consider cardiac consultation to assess the patient's cardiac status and risk for cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
Presumed secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess
   though also in the context of active C diff infection.  Despite
   persistent fevers, patient has done well as we have continued to wean
   pressors and he has become more responsive.   Still concern for
   remaining closed space infection.  Weaned off norepinephrine since
   [**2157-3-27**].
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -rescan Monday or Tuesday (d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and ID) for remaining fluid
   collections
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume in
   conjunction with lasix gtt to decrease anasarca
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
Presumed secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess
   though also in the context of active C diff infection.  Despite
   persistent fevers, patient has done well as we have continued to wean
   pressors and he has become more responsive.   Still concern for
   remaining closed space infection.  Weaned off norepinephrine since
   [**2157-3-27**].
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -rescan Monday or Tuesday (d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and ID) for remaining fluid
   collections
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume in
   conjunction with lasix gtt to decrease anasarca
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with left thigh MRSA cellulitis and developed acute abdominal pain, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient is presumed to be in septic shock secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess, although the presence of active C. diff infection may also be contributing. Despite persistent fevers, the patient has done well with continued broad-spectrum antibiotics and has become more responsive.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, with pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR. He is currently on stable ventilator settings and has had bronchoscopies to assess lung aeration.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated FDP levels, meeting parameters for DIC, although he is not clinically in DIC given the absence of diffuse bleeding. Empirical treatment for DIC is being initiated.
4. Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: The patient is being managed for sepsis, and transfusion parameters are being monitored.
5. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts in his urine, indicating ATN, although his urine output is increasing. He may have experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis.
6. C. diff: The patient has C. diff infection, which is being treated with IV flagyl.
7. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient has leukemia cutis, and his oncology team is monitoring his counts.
8. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient is being managed for atrial fibrillation, and cardiology has been consulted. Norepinephrine is being weaned off, and consideration is being given to emergent cardioversion if the patient becomes acutely unstable.
9. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient has a sacral deep tissue injury, which is being managed by wound nurses.
10. FEN: The patient is being managed for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, with IVFs and TPN.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and respiratory failure may lead to further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and pulmonary edema may increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's duodenal perforation and C. diff infection may lead to GI bleeding.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and RVR may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ATN and potential for further kidney injury may lead to renal failure.
6. Coagulopathy-related bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he develops further organ dysfunction.
7. Wound complications: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury may become infected or develop complications, such as abscesses or cellulitis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his management plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
   - Off pressors x 24 hours
   - Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff
   - Cont vanc/meropenem/fluconazole for empiric sepsis - tailor regimen
   as cx data becomes available
   - Cont IV flagyl for c. diff
   # AML/Leukemia cutis
   - Following counts
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50)
   - BMT following
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   - Volume overload on CXR
 lasix gtt per surgery plus albumin
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC. Not ready for PS yet until chest wall
   edema/ anasarca starts to lift
   # Somnolence
   - Significantly improved after weaning sedation, but now back on
   fentanyl for pain/cough control
   # Coagulopathy:
   - Improving
   - Presumed [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from chemo.
   Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs/HIT
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   # Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial hcts
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
   #ATN
   - RF improving
   - meds adjusted for GFR
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer perforation, who developed acute abdominal pain and was found to have free air on CT scan. He underwent surgery and was diagnosed with c.diff, MRSA cellulitis, and leukemia cutis/AML.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.7°F, heart rate 115 bpm, blood pressure 94/57 mmHg, respiratory rate 11 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure 33.5 mmHg, mean arterial pressure 69 mmHg, and cardiac output 4.2 L/min.
* Fluid balance: Total input 3528 mL, total output 4210 mL, and net balance -682 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure 24 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and his blood pressure is within normal limits.
* Neurologic: The patient is sedated and not responsive.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 9.7 K/uL, platelet count 51 K/uL, and creatinine 1.1 mg/dL.
* Imaging: The patient has bibasilar infiltrates and effusions on chest X-ray.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis/hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has a history of c.diff and MRSA cellulitis, which may contribute to his hypotension.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory rate is high, which may indicate respiratory failure.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and may have ongoing bleeding from surgical drains.
* Bowel perforation: The patient has a history of bowel perforation and may have ongoing peritoneal contamination.
* C.diff: The patient has a history of c.diff and may continue to have ongoing diarrhea and abdominal pain.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which may contribute to his hypotension and cardiac output.
* Leukemia cutis/AML: The patient has leukemia cutis/AML, which may contribute to his bone marrow suppression and bleeding diathesis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Off pressors for 24 hours
* Continue empiric antibiotics for sepsis
* Continue IV flagyl for c.diff
* Follow-up with serial hemoglobin and platelet counts
* Continue mechanical ventilation and wean FiO2 as tolerated
* Continue IV fluids and albumin as needed
* Follow-up with serial chest X-rays and abdominal CT scans
* Consider bone marrow transplantation following recovery from current illness."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with acute abdominal pain and was found to have a perforated colon, which was surgically repaired. He has developed sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory failure, and is receiving pressors, antibiotics, and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient has a white blood cell count of 9.7, a platelet count of 51, and a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL. His creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen level is 26 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Sepsis/hypotension
* AML/leukemia cutis
* Respiratory failure
* Somnolence
* Coagulopathy
* Bowel perforation
* C. difficile infection
* Acute tubular necrosis
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued pressors to maintain blood pressure
* Antibiotics for sepsis and C. difficile infection
* Respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Blood product transfusions as needed
* Further surgery to repair the perforated colon and drain abscesses
* Chemotherapy for AML
* Monitoring for bleeding and coagulopathy

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated complications
* Bleeding and coagulopathy
* Infection and sepsis
* Organ failure, including kidney and liver failure
* Cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock
* Neurological complications, including seizures and coma

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
   - Off pressors x 24 hours
   - Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff
   - Cont vanc/meropenem/fluconazole for empiric sepsis - tailor regimen
   as cx data becomes available
   - Cont IV flagyl for c. diff
   # AML/Leukemia cutis
   - Following counts
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50)
   - BMT following
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   - Volume overload on CXR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and acute abdominal pain. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and then repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak. The patient has developed sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory failure, and is being treated with empiric antibiotics and vasopressors. He also has AML/Leukemia cutis, somnolence, coagulopathy, and bowel perforation. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his underlying infections, including MRSA cellulitis and C. diff. This could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation. This could lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or lung injury.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to his underlying condition and the need for anticoagulation therapy. This could lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is a potentially life-threatening complication that could lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
5. C. diff: The patient's C. diff infection could lead to further complications, such as diarrhea, dehydration, and potentially life-threatening colitis.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to further complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
7. Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis could lead to further complications, such as skin breakdown, infection, and potentially life-threatening bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor and manage his various medical issues to prevent further complications and improve his chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc..  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  .
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -ID would like to rescan for persistent collection but surgery would
   prefer to postpone given no planned further intervention at this time
   and low suspicion for colleciton
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   -No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck evel in AM)
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc..  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  .
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -ID would like to rescan for persistent collection but surgery would
   prefer to postpone given no planned further intervention at this time
   and low suspicion for colleciton
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   -No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck evel in AM)
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain, and a CT scan showed free air and perforation, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He was diagnosed with septic shock, presumed secondary to duodenal perforation and abscess, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has respiratory failure, hypercarbic and hypoxemic, and is being ventilated. He has a coagulopathy, which is being empirically treated for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts in his urine and is being monitored for worsening kidney function. He is also being treated for C. difficile infection and has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock is being managed, but there is a risk of continued organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with ventilation, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is being empirically treated for DIC, but there is a risk of bleeding complications if not managed properly.
4. Acute tubular necrosis: The patient's ATN is being monitored, but there is a risk of worsening kidney function and potential need for dialysis.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's C. difficile infection is being treated, but there is a risk of recurrence and potential complications such as colitis and sepsis.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being monitored, but there is a risk of continued rapid ventricular response and potential complications such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
7. Wound infection: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury is being monitored, but there is a risk of wound infection and potential complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
8. DVT or PE: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to his immobility and medical conditions.
9. Organ failure: The patient is at risk for developing organ failure, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure, due to his underlying medical conditions and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to assess the progression of his septic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Adjust his antibiotic regimen as necessary to ensure effective treatment of his infections.
3. Continue to manage his respiratory failure with ventilation and monitor for worsening respiratory failure.
4. Empirically treat his coagulopathy for DIC and monitor for bleeding complications.
5. Monitor his kidney function and adjust his fluid management and electrolyte levels as necessary.
6. Continue to treat his C. difficile infection and monitor for recurrence.
7. Monitor his atrial fibrillation and adjust his anticoagulation regimen as necessary to prevent stroke or cardiac arrest.
8. Monitor his wound and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent wound infection and promote healing.
9. Monitor for DVT or PE and adjust his anticoagulation regimen as necessary to prevent complications.
10. Consider consulting with a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, surgeons, and infectious disease specialists, to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for the patient."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis and left thigh MRSA cellulitis, which progressed to acute abdominal pain and multiple surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has developed multiple complications, including sepsis, hypotension, acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, bowel perforation, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and increased risk of mortality.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist or worsen, requiring continued vasopressor support.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring mechanical ventilation and continued oxygen therapy.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications and increased risk of mortality.
5. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation may lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
6. C. diff Infection: The patient's C. diff infection may worsen, leading to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased risk of mortality.
7. ATN: The patient's ATN may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and increased risk of mortality.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen, leading to increased risk of stroke and mortality.
9. Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis may progress, leading to increased risk of bleeding and infection.
10. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction syndrome may worsen, leading to increased risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust medications as needed to manage the patient's multiple complications.
3. Consider consulting with infectious disease and hematology specialists to optimize the patient's care.
4. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and nutritional support.
5. Consider referring the patient to a tertiary care center for further management and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
   - Off pressors x 24 hours
   - Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff
   - Cont vanc/meropenem/fluconazole for empiric sepsis - tailor regimen
   as cx data becomes available
   - Cont IV flagyl for c. diff
   # AML/Leukemia cutis
   - Following counts
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50)
   - BMT following
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   - Volume overload on CXR
 lasix gtt per surgery plus albumin
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC. Not ready for PS yet until chest wall
   edema/ anasarca starts to lift
   # Somnolence
   - Significantly improved after weaning sedation, but now back on
   fentanyl for pain/cough control
   # Coagulopathy:
   - Improving
   - Presumed [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from chemo.
   Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs/HIT
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   # Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial hcts
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
   #ATN
   - RF improving
   - meds adjusted for GFR
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   Other issues per Resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He developed acute abdominal pain, which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and subsequently, a repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in a leak.

The patient is currently experiencing sepsis/hypotension, which is likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He is receiving empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole, as well as IV flagyl for C. diff.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and volume overload on his chest X-ray. He is receiving lasix gtt and albumin to manage this condition.

He is also experiencing somnolence, which has improved after weaning sedation but has worsened due to the need for fentanyl for pain and cough control.

The patient has a coagulopathy, which is improving but still requires close monitoring, and he is at risk for bleeding due to the presence of surgical drains.

He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has improved after surgery but may persist. He requires repletion of electrolytes and consideration of changing pressors if persistent arrhythmias occur.

Other issues of concern include acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is improving, and chronic kidney disease, which requires adjustments to medications and fluids.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and his glycemic control is being monitored.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: continued deterioration in blood pressure, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Respiratory failure: worsening hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
3. Coagulopathy: bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, due to the presence of surgical drains.
4. Atrial fibrillation: persistent arrhythmias, leading to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
5. Acute tubular necrosis: further deterioration in kidney function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. C. diff: continued spread of the infection, leading to sepsis or organ failure.
7. Bowel perforation: further complications, including peritonitis or abscess formation.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with acute abdominal pain and was found to have a perforated colon, which required surgery. He also has a history of MRSA cellulitis and c. difficile infection.

The patient's current condition is critical, with the following concerns:

1. Sepsis and Hypotension: The patient is on pressors and has been experiencing hypotension, which is being managed with aggressive diuresis. He is receiving empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole, and will need to have his regimen tailored based on culture data.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a volume overload on his chest X-ray. He is receiving oxygen therapy and will need to be weaned off it as tolerated.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a presumed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with additional hits to his bone marrow from chemotherapy. He is bleeding from his surgical drains and will need to have his DIC labs and HIT monitored.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient has a perforated colon and will need to undergo further surgery.
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a c. difficile infection, which may be contributing to his perforated colon.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which is being managed with medications adjusted for his glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being managed with repletion of electrolytes and consideration of changing his pressors if the arrhythmia persists.

The patient's laboratory results show the following:

* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.3
* Platelet count: 63
* Creatinine: 1.1
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28
* Glucose: 105
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show a poor-quality chest X-ray with evidence of volume overload.

Based on this information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock
2. Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome
3. Coagulopathy and bleeding
4. Bowel perforation and peritonitis
5. C. difficile infection and colitis
6. Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
7. Atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias
8. Leukemia cutis and bone marrow suppression

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics, pressors, diuretics, and supportive care. He will need to be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration and will require further surgical interventions to address his bowel perforation and c. difficile infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He is currently admitted to the ICU with acute abdominal pain, sepsis, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.9°C (102.1°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (98-120 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 117/64 mmHg (83-117/64 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (0-28 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 63 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Poor quality, with evidence of volume overload
* CT scan: Concerning for free air and abscess drainage

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is on pressors and has a high risk of sepsis due to his multiple surgeries and infections.
* AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient's bone marrow is suppressed, and he has a high risk of bleeding and infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and is at risk of further respiratory compromise.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to his low platelet count and presumed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
* Bowel perforation: The patient has a high risk of further bowel perforation and peritonitis.
* C. difficile infection: The patient has a high risk of further C. difficile infection and peritonitis.
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient has a high risk of ATN due to his sepsis and hypotension.
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has a high risk of arrhythmias and cardiac complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding
* Bowel perforation and peritonitis
* C. difficile infection and peritonitis
* Acute tubular necrosis
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve his clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of sepsis/hypotension, c.diff, and the empiric sepsis regimen.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, and the volume overload on CXR may worsen their respiratory status.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to presumed DIC with additional hits to the bone marrow from chemotherapy, and may require platelet transfusions, FFP, and cryoprecipitate.
4. Bowel Perforation: The patient has a history of bowel perforation and may require further surgery to manage the perforation.
5. C. difficile: The patient has a c. difficile infection, which may worsen their clinical condition.
6. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has a risk of developing ATN due to the use of nephrotoxic medications and the presence of acute kidney injury.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may require management with rate control medications and consideration of cardioversion.
8. Leukemia Cutis: The patient has leukemia cutis, which may require further treatment with chemotherapy and monitoring of blood counts.
9. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which may require management with diuretics and albumin infusions.
10. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which may require drainage with a pigtail catheter.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck level in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC
   # Comm: Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4140**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck level in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of MRSA cellulitis, c.diff, and perforated bowel.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a high risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and the presence of pleural effusions.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated FDP levels and is at risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Renal failure: The patient has experienced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is at risk of developing worsening kidney function.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is on pressors and has a history of hypotension, which may indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability.
6. Wound complications: The patient has a sacral deep tissue injury and is at risk of developing wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is at risk of developing cardiovascular instability.
8. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk of developing infectious complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and may be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.

To address these potential complications, the patient's medical team should:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Maintain adequate fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Manage the patient's respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and consider weaning him off the ventilator when possible.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and treat any bleeding or coagulation disorders promptly.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Manage the patient's wound care and prevent wound complications.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider cardioversion if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust his TPN as needed.
9. Consider antibiotic therapy for any suspected infections.

Overall, the patient's medical team should work closely together to manage his complex medical condition and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o

   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc..  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  .
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -ID would like to rescan for persistent collection but surgery would
   prefer to postpone given no planned further intervention at this time
   and low suspicion for colleciton
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   -No further attempts to diurese today

   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain with CT concerning for free air and underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of MRSA cellulitis, c.diff, and duodenal perforation. The patient's fevers and hypotension are concerning signs of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, and the patient is at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the perforated bowel.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, and the patient is at risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to the presence of elevated FDP.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is a concern, and the patient is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
5. C.diff: The patient's c.diff infection is a concern, and the patient is at risk of developing recurrent infections if not managed properly.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a concern, and the patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications if not managed properly.
7. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury is a concern, and the patient is at risk of developing wound complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA, c.diff, and other potential infections.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely and consider empirical treatment for DIC.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's c.diff infection with IV flagyl.
6. Consider cardioversion for atrial fibrillation if the patient becomes acutely unstable.
7. Manage the patient's sacral deep tissue injury with wound care and consider surgical intervention if necessary.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing serious complications due to the presence of multiple comorbidities and the severity of his illness. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck evel in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today

   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**]. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

Current status:

* The patient is septic with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension.
* He has respiratory failure with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and is on ventilator support.
* He has a coagulopathy with elevated FDP, but is not clinically in DIC.
* He has acute kidney injury with muddy brown casts in urine, but is oliguric.
* He has C. difficile infection, and is being treated with IV flagyl.
* He has AML/leukemia cutis, and is being treated with dacogen.
* He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and is being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.
* Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to perforated bowel and sepsis.
* Coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to sepsis and AML/leukemia cutis.
* Acute kidney injury and possible need for dialysis due to sepsis and hypoperfusion.
* C. difficile infection and possible complications such as colitis and sepsis.
* AML/leukemia cutis and possible complications such as bleeding and infection.
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and possible complications such as stroke and heart failure.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, fluconazole) to cover potential sources of infection.
* Monitor for signs of septic shock and adjust management accordingly.
* Continue respiratory support with ventilator therapy and consider placement of pigtail catheter in left chest for pleural effusions.
* Manage coagulopathy with blood products and anticoagulation therapy.
* Monitor kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Continue treatment for C. difficile infection and AML/leukemia cutis.
* Monitor atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion if necessary.
* Continue to replete electrolytes and fluids as needed.
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and infection, and adjust management accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
    CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodental perforation but no clear
   evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - bronch today given aspiration event on [**3-30**] and surgery request for
   bronch
   - pigtail catheter to be placed in left chest per IP
   - send pleural fluid for gm stain and cx
   - attempt PS trial after sitting patient up in bed to reduce PEEP
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT reccs
   - family meeting today to discuss prognosis of AML given limited
   chemotherapy regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications have arisen:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents are likely the source of continued infection, leading to septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is exacerbated by sepsis and the presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient meets parameters for DIC, although they are not clinically in DIC due to the absence of diffuse bleeding. Empirical treatment for DIC is being initiated due to the high risk.
4. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts in their urine, indicating ATN, which is likely a result of hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient was diagnosed with C. difficile in the setting of abdominal pain and septic picture.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's tachycardia is likely a response to being septic and post-operatively, and is being managed with norepinephrine.
7. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient has a wound that is being managed by wound nurses.
8. Feeding and nutrition: The patient is NPO for now and is receiving IV fluids and TPN to replete electrolytes as needed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.
2. Monitoring and treating for septic shock, including the use of vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
3. Managing respiratory failure with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy to evaluate for mucous plugs or collapse.
4. Empirically treating for DIC with blood products, FFP, and blood transfusions as needed.
5. Monitoring and managing ATN with close attention to urine output and electrolyte levels.
6. Managing C. difficile infection with IV flagyl and surgery following.
7. Managing atrial fibrillation with norepinephrine and close monitoring for signs of instability.
8. Managing sacral deep tissue injury with wound care and close monitoring for signs of infection.
9. Providing nutritional support with TPN and IV fluids as needed.
10. Monitoring and managing electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.
11. Continuously reassessing the patient's condition and adjusting the plan of care as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck level in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to

   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* White blood cell count: 8.2 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 22.8%
* Platelet count: 50 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30 mg/dL
* Glucose: 127 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.
* Respiratory failure: Hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis, with pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
* Coagulopathy: Meets parameters for DIC, but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.
* Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: Sepsis management as above.
* AML/Leukemia cutis: Likely counts will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR: On arrival, very tachycardic to 130-150 beats per minute, likely all response to being septic and post-operatively.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, fluconazole).
* ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of counts dropping soon.
* CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess.
* Albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume.
* No further attempts to diurese today.
* Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50.
* Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs.
* Continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170 today.
* Place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural effusions and?parapneumonic effusion.
* Daily ABGs.
* Continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed.
* Coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6.
* S/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**].
* F/u renal reccs.
* Monitor lytes.
* Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck level in AM).
* Cont with IV flagyl.
* Surgery following.
* Tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery.
* Tx to keep plts >50K.
* BMT recs.
* Hold nodal agents for now.
* No amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if spontaneously converts.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Coagulopathy
* Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation
* AML/Leukemia cutis
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Sacral deep tissue injury
* FEN (Fistula)
* Access issues with RIJ, left radial a-line, and left PICC
* VAP (Ventilator-associated pneumonia)
* DVT (Deep vein thrombosis)
* Stress ulcer
* ATN (Acute tubular necrosis)"

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodental perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - bronch today given aspiration event on [**3-30**] and surgery request for
   bronch
   - pigtail catheter to be placed in left chest per IP
   - send pleural fluid for gm stain and cx
   - attempt PS trial after sitting patient up in bed to reduce PEEP
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT reccs
   - family meeting today to discuss prognosis of AML given limited
   chemotherapy regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodental perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - bronch today given aspiration event on [**3-30**] and surgery request for
   bronch
   - pigtail catheter to be placed in left chest per IP
   - send pleural fluid for gm stain and cx
   - attempt PS trial after sitting patient up in bed to reduce PEEP
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT reccs
   - family meeting today to discuss prognosis of AML given limited
   chemotherapy regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and acute abdominal pain. He developed septic shock, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy, and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, albumin, and blood products to manage his septic shock and coagulopathy. He has also been ventilated for respiratory failure and has a pigtail catheter in his left chest for drainage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt management with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors. If left untreated, sepsis can lead to organ failure, shock, and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management with ventilatory support. If not managed properly, respiratory failure can lead to hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and death.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a significant concern, as it can lead to bleeding, organ failure, and death. Empirical treatment with blood products and anticoagulants is necessary to manage this condition.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is a serious condition that requires close monitoring and management with medications and cardioversion. If left untreated, atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, heart failure, and death.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney injury is a concern, as it can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease. Close monitoring of kidney function and management with dialysis may be necessary.
6. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis is a significant concern, as it can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and colonic perforation. Management with antibiotics and supportive care is necessary to prevent complications.
7. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management with chemotherapy and blood transfusions. If left untreated, leukemia cutis/AML can lead to organ failure, shock, and death.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve his chances of survival."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient
   is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors, will attempt to get 1L negative today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement yesterday and patient did well on PS trial.  S/p bronch on
   [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.
   Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.
   - IP to drain right side effusion today, will send for studies, CXR
   afterward and attempt [**6-7**] trial if tolerates
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain, which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.
2. Respiratory failure: Both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis, with CXR showing pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
3. Coagulopathy: Meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP, but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.
4. Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: Sepsis management as above, transfusion parameters as above.
5. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): With muddy brown casts in urine, likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis.
6. Clostridium difficile (C.diff): Diagnosed in the setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon interval development of septic picture.
7. AML/Leukemia cutis: S/p dacogen, with ongoing treatment to keep HCT>25 and plts >50K.
8. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): Stabilizing, but still requires close monitoring.
9. Sacral deep tissue injury: Wound nurses following.
10. FEN (feeding): NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.2-9.6
* Hct: 24.6-26.4
* Plt: 28-56
* Cr: 1.1-1.2
* TCO2: 29-31
* Glucose: 127-163
* Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* LDH: 291 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Meropenem
* Metronidazole
* Fluconazole
* Fentanyl
* Norepinephrine
* Midazolam
* Pantoprazole
* Heparin Sodium
* Lasix
* Albumin
* Blood products

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Weaning pressors and repleting with blood products as needed
* Monitoring and managing respiratory failure
* Treating coagulopathy and ATN
* Managing C.diff and AML/Leukemia cutis
* Monitoring and managing atrial fibrillation
* Wound care for sacral deep tissue injury
* Feeding with TPN

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient
   is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors, will attempt to get 1L negative today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement yesterday and patient did well on PS trial.  S/p bronch on
   [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.
   Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.
   - IP to drain right side effusion today, will send for studies, CXR
   afterward and attempt [**6-7**] trial if tolerates
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
    # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient
   is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors, will attempt to get 1L negative today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement yesterday and patient did well on PS trial.  S/p bronch on
   [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.
   Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.
   - IP to drain right side effusion today, will send for studies, CXR
   afterward and attempt [**6-7**] trial if tolerates
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a duodenal ulcer who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain with CT concerning for free air and is now post-right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient has a number of significant medical issues, including:

1. Bowel perforation with septic shock: The patient has a duodenal perforation and is experiencing septic shock, which is being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is being managed with blood transfusions and anticoagulant therapy.
4. Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: The patient has a duodenal perforation and is at risk for further complications, including abscess formation and sepsis.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which is being managed with fluid management and close monitoring of renal function.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which is being managed with antibiotics.
7. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient has AML/Leukemia cutis, which is being managed with chemotherapy and close monitoring.
8. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being managed with beta blockers and anticoagulant therapy.
9. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient has a sacral deep tissue injury, which is being managed with wound care and close monitoring.
10. FEN (feeding and electrolyte management): The patient is being managed with TPN and close monitoring of electrolyte levels.

The patient is at risk for a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his bowel perforation and C. difficile infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for further coagulopathy due to his underlying liver disease and anticoagulant therapy.
4. Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: The patient is at risk for further complications, including abscess formation and sepsis, due to his duodenal perforation.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient is at risk for further acute kidney injury due to his underlying kidney disease and fluid management.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient is at risk for further C. difficile infection due to his underlying gut disease and antibiotic therapy.
7. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient is at risk for further complications, including bleeding and infection, due to his AML/Leukemia cutis.
8. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is at risk for further complications, including cardiac arrest and stroke, due to his atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
9. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient is at risk for further complications, including infection and sepsis, due to his sacral deep tissue injury.

The patient's overall prognosis is guarded, and he is at risk for a number of potential complications. Close monitoring and management of his medical issues are essential to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with severe respiratory failure, abdominal perfusion, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. They are intubated and require vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure. The patient has a history of cancer and is experiencing coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. They are receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors, and are being treated with TPN and lipids for nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and they require ongoing mechanical ventilation. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure exacerbation is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe, and they are at risk for organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
3. Coagulopathy and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage, particularly with invasive procedures.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a concern, and they may require ongoing vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
5. Volume Overload: The patient's total body volume is overloaded, which increases the risk of fluid overload and cardiac failure.
6. Cancer Progression: The patient's underlying cancer may be progressing, which could worsen their overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutrition is being provided through TPN, which may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.
8. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are being monitored, but they may be at risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, particularly with the use of insulin and other medications.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly with the use of invasive devices and the presence of cancer.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and optimize their care."

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient
   is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**], metronidazole d1=[**3-21**],
   fluconazole d1=[**3-21**]
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors, will attempt to get 1L negative today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement yesterday and patient did well on PS trial.  S/p bronch on
   [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.
   Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.
   - IP to drain right side effusion today, will send for studies, CXR
   afterward and attempt [**6-7**] trial if tolerates
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
    # Access: RIJ,  left midline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 THORACENTESIS - At [**2157-4-1**] 01:28 PM
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2157-4-1**] 03:00 PM
   -Received two units of platelets in the morning for drainage of right
   sided pleural effusion (had thoracentesis to remove 1.2 L fluid)
   -Had diffuse oozing of blood from colostomy site and some IV sites
   prior to platelets and resolved somewhat, Hct checked from drain and
   was <2%
   -A-line d/c'd as not working
   -Had right sided thoracentesis with 1.2 L of fluid removed (unable to
   place drain because collection too posterior)
   -Got one packet of platelets in PM for plt 29, deferred blood given
   overall goal to get patient negative
   -Weaned from [**11-12**] to [**11-7**] in AM and did well till late afternoon
   -Had blood gas in PM that showed increasing hypoxia and more
   concerningly hypercarbia, then began to have smaller tidal volumes and
   signs of tiring so put back on AC, got tachycardic briefly w/ increased
   ectopy but then settled down again

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, who was admitted with leukemia cutis and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury. He has a duodenal perforation, C. difficile infection, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's continued fevers and wide differential diagnosis, including infection, tumor, and other causes, need to be addressed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure is a concern, especially in the setting of sepsis. The patient's CXR shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, which may be indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy meets parameters for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), although he does not have clinically apparent bleeding. Empirical treatment for DIC is necessary due to the patient's high risk.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is a concern, especially with the development of muddy brown casts in his urine. The patient's urine output is increasing, but close monitoring of his renal function is necessary.
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient's C. difficile infection needs to be treated with IV flagyl, and surgery may be necessary.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requires close monitoring, and cardioversion may be necessary if the patient becomes acutely unstable.
7. Duodenal Perforation: The patient's duodenal perforation requires continued management of sepsis and coagulopathy, as well as consideration for surgical intervention.
8. Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis requires continued treatment with chemotherapy and close monitoring of his blood counts.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Continue empirical treatment for DIC.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Treat the patient's C. difficile infection with IV flagyl.
6. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation closely and consider cardioversion if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's duodenal perforation with sepsis and coagulopathy management.
8. Continue treatment for leukemia cutis with chemotherapy and close monitoring of blood counts."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and acute abdominal pain. He developed septic shock, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood products, and albumin. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and has been weaned from norepinephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for continued sepsis due to the ongoing infection and duodenal perforation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to the ongoing sepsis, pneumonia, and pleural effusions.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for continued coagulopathy due to the ongoing sepsis, DIC, and bleeding.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient is at risk for hemodynamic instability due to the ongoing sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiac dysfunction.
5. Renal Failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to the ongoing sepsis, hypovolemia, and ATN.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is at risk for metabolic acidosis due to the ongoing sepsis, hypovolemia, and kidney dysfunction.
7. Wound Complications: The patient is at risk for wound complications due to the ongoing sepsis, hypovolemia, and poor perfusion.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest due to the ongoing sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiac dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood products as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider extubation if possible.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely and consider transfusions as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and consider vasopressors as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic status closely and consider insulin therapy if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's wound status closely and consider wound care and dressing changes as needed.
8. Consider cardiac monitoring and consider cardioversion if the patient's cardiac status deteriorates."

   -Received two units of platelets in the morning for drainage of right
   sided pleural effusion (had thoracentesis to remove 1.2 L fluid)
   -Had diffuse oozing of blood from colostomy site and some IV sites
   prior to platelets and resolved somewhat, Hct checked from drain and
   was <2%
   -A-line d/c'd as not working
   -Had right sided thoracentesis with 1.2 L of fluid removed (unable to
   place drain because collection too posterior)
   -Got one packet of platelets in PM for plt 29, deferred blood given
   overall goal to get patient negative
   -Weaned from [**11-12**] to [**11-7**] in AM and did well till late afternoon
   -Had blood gas in PM that showed increasing hypoxia and more
   concerningly hypercarbia, then began to have smaller tidal volumes and
   signs of tiring so put back on AC, got tachycardic briefly w/ increased
   ectopy but then settled down again

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery, admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain with CT concerning for free air and underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has been experiencing septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury (ATN) due to hypoperfusion. He has also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for continued sepsis due to the ongoing infection and duodenal perforation, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to persist due to the ongoing sepsis and coexisting medical conditions, which may require ongoing mechanical ventilation and respiratory support.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue due to the ongoing sepsis and duodenal perforation, which may lead to further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's ATN is likely to persist due to the ongoing sepsis and hypoperfusion, which may require ongoing dialysis support.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is likely to continue due to the ongoing sepsis and may require ongoing anticoagulation and cardioversion.
6. C.diff: The patient's c.diff infection is likely to persist due to the ongoing sepsis and may require ongoing treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.
7. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is likely to continue due to the ongoing sepsis and may require ongoing treatment with chemotherapy and supportive care.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's sepsis, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and ATN are being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis support. The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is being managed with anticoagulation and cardioversion. The patient's c.diff infection is being managed with antibiotics and supportive care. The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is being managed with chemotherapy and supportive care. The patient's wound is being managed with wound care and antibiotics. The patient's nutrition is being managed with TPN and glycemic control. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 13), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 14), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 14)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - restart lasix gtt
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 14)
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint: 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial
   fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia
   cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff
   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   24 Hour Events:
   [**4-1**]
   -Received two units of platelets in the morning for drainage of right
   sided pleural effusion (had thoracentesis to remove 1.2 L fluid)
   -Had diffuse oozing of blood from colostomy site and some IV sites
   prior to platelets and resolved somewhat, Hct checked from drain and
   was <2%
   -A-line d/c'd as not working
   -Had right sided thoracentesis with 1.2 L of fluid removed (unable to
   place drain because collection too posterior)
   -Got one packet of platelets in PM for plt 29, deferred blood given
   overall goal to get patient negative
   -Weaned from [**11-12**] to [**11-7**] in AM and did well till late afternoon
   -Had blood gas in PM that showed increasing hypoxia and more
   concerningly hypercarbia, then began to have smaller tidal volumes and
   signs of tiring so put back on AC, got tachycardic briefly w/ increased
   ectopy but then settled down again

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 13), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 14), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 14)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - restart lasix gtt
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 14)
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, duodenal ulcer, leukemia cutis/AML, and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, acute abdominal pain, and a history of c.diff.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, thoracentesis, and removal of a duodenal perforation. He has also received various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and blood products.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a CXR showing pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. He has been extubated successfully.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but his heart rate has been stable over the last several days.
* Hematological status: The patient has a coagulopathy, with elevated FDP and INR, but is not clinically in DIC.
* Renal status: The patient has developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts in his urine, but his urine output has been increasing.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a duodenal perforation and has undergone a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has not been fully resolved, and he remains at risk for further complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase his risk of bleeding and other complications.
* ATN: The patient's ATN may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further kidney damage.
* Duodenal perforation: The patient's duodenal perforation may lead to further complications, including abscess formation and sepsis.
* C.diff: The patient's C.diff infection may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Monitoring and managing his coagulopathy
* Managing his respiratory status with supplemental oxygen and bronchodilators
* Monitoring and managing his renal status with furosemide and albumin
* Managing his gastrointestinal status with IV fluids and total parenteral nutrition
* Monitoring and managing his atrial fibrillation with rate control medications
* Continuing to follow up with his oncologist for his AML/leukemia cutis

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   off Lasix drip and leviphed and see if he maintains MAPS with
   transition to less aggressive care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1.       Resp Failure: We were able to extubate him successfully last
   night with a clear sense from family that he is not to be re intubated.
   He is tolerating but tyrick may be to keep him negative
   2.           Hemodynamics: intravasc dry but total body volume
   completely overloaded
 getting a little levophed to maintain MAP 60,
   but trying to gain ground on keeping negative to maintain adequate
   oxygenation. This is a short term solution as family is spenindong time
   with him today and needs to be readdressed in AM. That is, can we shuit
   off Lasix drip and leviphed and see if he maintains MAPS with
   transition to less aggressive care.
   3.           AML: Coagulapathic and thrombocytopenic. Transfuse plt
   only as needed for procedures or active bleeding- no plans for Rx touch
   base with Onc in AM.
   4.       Abdominal Perforation: still with open abdomen , no plans for
   intervention. Discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4443**] this morning on rounds, her

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall, 137.8 kg male with a perforated abdomen, who remains extubated after a planned extubation. He is currently on low-dose pressor support and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory support includes a face tent and standby ventilator mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has significant fluid overload, with a total fluid input of 4,860 mL and a total fluid output of 6,595 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -1,735 mL. His urine output is 5,400 mL, and his NG tube output is 410 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values, including an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP). His coagulation studies show a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating coagulopathy.

The patient's physical examination reveals fair air movement in the chest, soft minimal bowel sounds in the abdomen, and 4+ pitting edema and massive scrotal edema in the extremities.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently set to standby mode, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's oxygenation needs increase.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he is receiving low-dose pressor support to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. There is a risk of further hemodynamic instability if the patient's blood pressure drops.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation studies show abnormalities, including a prolonged PT, PTT, and INR. This increases the risk of bleeding complications if the patient undergoes invasive procedures.
4. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC and LDH levels, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload is significant, and there is a risk of further fluid accumulation if the patient's fluid input is not managed carefully.
6. Abdominal perforation: The patient's abdominal perforation is still present, and there is a risk of further complications if the perforation is not managed properly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   1.       Resp Failure: in setting of sig volume overload, diuresing
   well on lasix drip but this requires vasopressor support to
   accomplaish. Will try back on PSV today- did get fatigued overnight so
   may need PSV by day and AC by night . This is difficult situation as
   goal is extubation as soon as possible but plan for no re intubation
   shudl he fail and family hopeful to have some meaningful time to speak
   with him on goals oif at all possible post extubation
   2.       Hemodynamics: intravasc dry but total body volume completely
   overloaded
 getting a little levophed to maintain MAP 60, but trying
   to gain ground on keeping negative
   3.        AML: Coagulapathic and thrombocytopenic. Transfuse plt only
   as needed for procedures or active bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   well on lasix drip but this requires vasopressor support to
   accomplaish. Will try back on PSV today- did get fatigued overnight so
   may need PSV by day and AC by night . This is difficult situation as
   goal is extubation as soon as possible but plan for no re intubation
   shudl he fail and family hopeful to have some meaningful time to speak
   with him on goals oif at all possible post extubation
   2.       Hemodynamics: intravasc dry but total body volume completely
   overloaded
 getting a little levophed to maintain MAP 60, but trying
   to gain ground on keeping negative
   3.        AML: Coagulapathic and thrombocytopenic. Transfuse plt only

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 getting a little levophed to maintain MAP 60, but trying
   to gain ground on keeping negative to maintain adequate oxygenation.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall male with a weight of 137.8 kg, who has been admitted to the ICU with a perforated abdomen. He has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and pain management medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, and blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a face tent in place. His respiratory support includes a standby ventilator with a tidal volume of 854 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. He has a diagnosis of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and his skin integrity is impaired.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and the presence of a standby ventilator.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's intravascular volume is overloaded, and he is receiving vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. This may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, particularly if he requires invasive procedures or if he has a traumatic injury.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding complications, particularly if he requires platelet transfusions.
5. Abdominal perforation: The patient's abdominal perforation may lead to further complications, such as peritonitis, abscess formation, or fistulae.
6. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis may lead to further complications, such as organ failure, septic shock, or death.
7. Cancer: The patient's underlying cancer may lead to further complications, such as metastases, organ failure, or death.
8. Skin integrity impairment: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as pressure ulcers, skin infections, or sepsis.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing further complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent or minimize these complications."

   Chief Complaint: 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial
   fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia
   cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff
   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued to do well from a respiratory perspective post extubation
   - restarted lasix gtt, had good UOP
   - continued low dose levophed
   - increased frequency of fentanyl boluses to q1hr prn b/c of pain
   Plan:  continue diuresis with lasix gtt and levophed, continue
   antibiotics, two possible trajectories include (1) continue supportive
   care, e.g. antibx, diuresis, attempt to weane pressors, surgery does
   not plan to take patient back to OR, versus (2) onc thinks prognosis
   from AML is poor, therefore family may consider CMO.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia
   cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff
   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued to do well from a respiratory perspective post extubation
   - restarted lasix gtt, had good UOP
   - continued low dose levophed

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain, which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury. He is also being managed for atrial fibrillation, AML/leukemia cutis, and sacral deep tissue injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further sepsis due to the ongoing infection and persistent duodenal perforation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function can continue to deteriorate, leading to worsening renal failure.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Leukemia cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML can progress, leading to worsening hematological parameters and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury can worsen, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Based on the patient's current condition and treatment plan, the following actions should be taken:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the ongoing infection.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
3. Continue blood transfusions as needed to manage the patient's coagulopathy and anemia.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control and consider cardioversion if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's leukemia cutis/AML and consider chemotherapy or other treatments as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's sacral deep tissue injury and consider wound care and other treatments as necessary.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 13), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 14), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 14)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - restart lasix gtt
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal recs
   - monitor lytes
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 14)
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial
   fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia
   cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff
   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued to do well from a respiratory perspective post extubation
   - restarted lasix gtt, had good UOP
   - continued low dose levophed
   - increased frequency of fentanyl boluses to q1hr prn b/c of pain
   Plan:  continue diuresis with lasix gtt and levophed, continue
   antibiotics, two possible trajectories include (1) continue supportive
   care, e.g. antibx, diuresis, attempt to weane pressors, surgery does
   not plan to take patient back to OR, versus (2) onc thinks prognosis
   from AML is poor, therefore family may consider CMO.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 79-year-old male, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including leukemia cutis/AML, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and duodenal ulcer with a history of MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT findings concerning for free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient has been experiencing septic shock, likely due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents. He has also developed respiratory failure, with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis, and pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR.

The patient's coagulopathy is managed with blood, FFP, and blood transfusions as needed, with a goal INR <= 1.6. He has also developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts in urine, likely due to hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis.

The patient's medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, metronidazole, and fluconazole, as well as lasix, levophed, and fentanyl for pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Infection-related complications, such as abscess formation, wound infections, or bacteremia.
3. Gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus, perforation, or bleeding.
4. Coagulopathy-related complications, such as bleeding or thrombosis.
5. Respiratory failure-related complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
7. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 15), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 15)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - d/c'ed lasix gtt, pt diuresing well w/o lasix
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50 per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.  No longer has evidence of DIC on labs.
   - continue blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy and is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury (ATN). He is also experiencing sacral deep tissue injury and has a history of C. diff infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents. The patient's fevers and persistent duodenal perforation increase the risk of sepsis and its complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is exacerbated by his sepsis and pulmonary edema. The risk of respiratory failure is increased by the patient's underlying respiratory disease and the presence of pleural effusions.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a result of his sepsis and may increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's ATN is likely due to his hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis. The risk of ATN is increased by the patient's underlying kidney disease and the presence of muddy brown casts in his urine.
5. C. diff Infection: The patient's C. diff infection is a risk factor for sepsis and its complications. The patient's ongoing treatment with IV flagyl is aimed at preventing further C. diff infection.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for embolic events, and the patient is not anticoagulated. The risk of embolic events is increased by the patient's sepsis and the presence of atrial fibrillation.
7. Sacral Deep Tissue Injury: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury is a risk factor for infection and sepsis. The patient's wound nurses are following his wound care.
8. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML is a risk factor for sepsis and its complications. The patient is undergoing palliative induction therapy with decitabine.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for sepsis and its complications, and his underlying medical conditions increase the risk of respiratory failure, coagulopathy, ATN, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 15), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 15)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - d/c'ed lasix gtt, pt diuresing well w/o lasix
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50 per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.  No longer has evidence of DIC on labs.
   - continue blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 15)
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p decitabine 5day palliative induction
   therapy.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer status post surgery, admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He has undergone a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He has also been diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to adjust his treatment accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to persist, and he may require continued oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue, and he may require continued blood transfusions and anticoagulant therapy.
4. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's ATN is likely to resolve, but close monitoring of his renal function is necessary to adjust his treatment accordingly.
5. C. diff infection: The patient's C. diff infection is likely to persist, and he may require continued antibiotic therapy.
6. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is likely to continue, and close monitoring of his cardiac rhythm and hemodynamics is necessary to adjust his treatment accordingly.
7. Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury is likely to persist, and wound care is necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: The patient's hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation are likely to persist, and close monitoring of his abdominal status is necessary to adjust his treatment accordingly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible infections.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to adjust his treatment accordingly.
3. Continue blood transfusions and anticoagulant therapy as necessary to manage his coagulopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely to adjust his treatment accordingly.
5. Continue antibiotic therapy for C. diff infection.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and hemodynamics closely to adjust his treatment accordingly.
7. Continue wound care for sacral deep tissue injury.
8. Monitor the patient's abdominal status closely to adjust his treatment accordingly.

The patient's family has requested to take him home for the remaining time he has left, and hospice care has been arranged. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Goals of care: Setting up home with hospice. Insurance will not cover
   TPN if prognosis less than 3months.
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents. Off
   pressors and repleting with blood products +/- albumin as needed.  CT
   on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no clear evidence
   of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole

   - continue blood transfusions as needed
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 15)
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p decitabine 5day palliative induction
   therapy.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer s/p surgery, admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is critical, with septic shock, coagulopathy, and hemodynamic instability. He is on pressors and blood products to manage his septic shock. His hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation are being managed with sepsis management and transfusion parameters. He has resolved his C. diff infection.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.3-8.7 K/uL
* Hct: 24.9-28.5%
* Plt: 34-50 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9-1.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes/Conjunctiva: EOMI
* Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: NG tube
* Peripheral Vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed, Right DP pulse not assessed, Left DP pulse not assessed
* Extremities: Right: 2+, Left: 2+
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Follows simple commands, Responds to: Not assessed, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed

The patient's goals of care are to set up home with hospice, as insurance will not cover TPN if prognosis is less than 3 months. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status and is expected to be discharged home with hospice.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction
* Hemorrhage due to coagulopathy
* Wound infection or dehiscence
* Abscess or perforation of the remaining bowel
* Respiratory failure due to sepsis or pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure due to sepsis or atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure due to sepsis or dehydration
* Hepatic failure due to sepsis or liver disease
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to lack of oral intake or malabsorption
* Medication errors or interactions due to multiple medications and complex medical condition
* Psychological distress or depression due to terminal illness and hospice care.

These complications will require close monitoring and management by the healthcare team to prevent or treat them promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 15), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 15)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - d/c'ed lasix gtt, pt diuresing well w/o lasix
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50 per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.  No longer has evidence of DIC on labs.
   - continue blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 15)
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p decitabine 5day palliative induction
   therapy.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and duodenal perforation. He has undergone a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient has developed septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion. He has also been diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's condition has been improving, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a major concern, and he requires continued management with broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood products, and vasopressors.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and he requires continued supplemental oxygen and consideration of bronchodilators.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, and he requires continued blood transfusions and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic events.
4. ATN: The patient's ATN is a complication of hypoperfusion and requires close monitoring of his kidney function and electrolyte levels.
5. C. diff: The patient's C. diff infection requires continued treatment with oral vancomycin, and he requires close monitoring for signs of recurrence.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR requires continued monitoring and management, and he may require cardioversion if his heart rate becomes unstable.
7. Sacral Deep Tissue Injury: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury requires close monitoring and wound care management.
8. Hemicolectomy and Duodenal Perforation: The patient's hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation require continued management with antibiotics and blood products to prevent further complications.
9. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML requires continued treatment with decitabine and blood transfusions to manage his anemia and thrombocytopenia.
10. BMT: The patient's BMT requires coordination with the BMT team to ensure that he receives the appropriate treatment and support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the patient's septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider bronchodilators to improve his lung function.
3. Continue blood transfusions and anticoagulation therapy to manage the patient's coagulopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and electrolyte levels closely to manage his ATN.
5. Continue treatment with oral vancomycin for the patient's C. diff infection.
6. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR closely and consider cardioversion if his heart rate becomes unstable.
7. Continue wound care management for the patient's sacral deep tissue injury.
8. Continue antibiotics and blood products to manage the patient's hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation.
9. Continue treatment with decitabine and blood transfusions to manage the patient's leukemia cutis/AML.
10. Coordinate with the BMT team to ensure that the patient receives the appropriate treatment and support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff infection. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy and is now being planned for discharge to home with hospice care. The patient's current condition is complicated by septic shock, coagulopathy, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood products, and albumin as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation, leading to further complications such as organ failure, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, stroke, or other cardiovascular complications.
4. Duodenal Perforation: The patient's duodenal perforation may lead to further complications such as peritonitis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
5. C.diff Infection: The patient's c.diff infection may worsen, leading to further complications such as colitis, diarrhea, and sepsis.
6. Leukemia Cutis/AML: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML may progress, leading to further complications such as bone marrow failure, anemia, and bleeding.
7. Sacral Deep Tissue Injury: The patient's sacral deep tissue injury may lead to further complications such as wound infection, sepsis, and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood products as needed to manage the patient's septic shock and coagulopathy.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response closely and consider emergent cardioversion if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's duodenal perforation and c.diff infection with continued antibiotics and wound care.
4. Monitor the patient's leukemia cutis/AML and consider further treatment options if necessary.
5. Continue wound care and monitoring for the patient's sacral deep tissue injury.
6. Ensure the patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and that his family is aware of his wishes.
7. Coordinate with hospice care to ensure a smooth transition to home care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer, who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis.
* He has undergone a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and is now at risk for septic shock due to persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of intestinal contents.
* The patient has a coagulopathy, which is no longer clinically significant, and is being managed with blood transfusions as needed.
* He has a sacral deep tissue injury, which is being followed by wound nurses.
* The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being managed with norepinephrine and is not being considered for cardioversion at this time.
* The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which is being managed with IV flagyl.
* The patient is being considered for discharge to home with hospice, but the insurance will not cover TPN if the patient's prognosis is less than three months.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction
* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Infection and abscess formation due to persistent duodenal perforation
* Cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response
* Gastrointestinal complications due to ileostomy and potential bowel obstruction
* Nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate caloric intake and malabsorption
* Psychosocial complications due to patient's poor prognosis and desire to be discharged to home with hospice.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his condition, including sepsis management, coagulopathy management, and optimization of nutritional support."
