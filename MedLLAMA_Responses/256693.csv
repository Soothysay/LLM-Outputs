   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   pneumonia, PE, and leukostasis.  CXR shows small right pleural effusion
   and right upper lung airway disease.  Patient afebrile with scant
   sputum, however, and new lung findings developed while on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics.  D-dimer neg so PE unlikely, though assay
   can be falsely low when patient is anticoagulated, as Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 4948**] was
   (PTT 75 at time of test).  Leukostasis also a concern given profound
   leukocytosis, though no headaches or visual changes on exam.  Heme/onc
   thinks leukostasis unlikely but will treat empirically.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - heme/onc does not believe leukapheresis indicated at this time
   - consider bronch and biopsy
   - consider LENIs
   - consider repeat D-dimer off heparin
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   #. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Concerning for
   infection vs steroid-effect vs known C. diff infection effect vs
   progression or transformation of leukemia.  Per onc, in patient's with
   CMML, white counts can rise significantly in setting of infection.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool cx
   - antibiotics as above and po flagyl for C. diff
   - flow cytometry
   - consider ID c/s (reccomended by heme/onc)
   - follow up results of bone marrow biopsy performed at [**Hospital3 **]
   - Treating with Hydrea 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] to bring down WBC count acutely.
   #. Right sided pulmonary infiltrate:  Developed during hospitalization
   at [**Hospital1 **] so will treat empirically for HAP but concerned about
   leukostasis as above.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - sputum cx
   - heme/onc eval as above
   #. Atypical chest pain:  Symptoms fit an anginal pattern, with
   worsening left chest pain with activity, but no EKG changes or
   q-waves.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to lung process vs MSK.
   - continue to follow
   #. C. diff:  Began four days after starting vanc/levo at [**Hospital1 **] and
   treated with po vancomycin per renal reccs by their consult service.
   - will treat with po flagyl alone and not continue po vanc
   #. Rectal mass:  Biopsied at [**Hospital1 **] by surgery under anesthesia.  Not
   visually apparent on exam.
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   #. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Has not received chemotherapy for this.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to
   history of cyclophosphamide for membranous nephropathy.
   - f/u heme/onc reccs
   #. Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy.
   - renally dose meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who is being transferred to a new hospital for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress. He has a right-sided pulmonary infiltrate, leukocytosis, and atypical chest pain. He has received various antibiotics and medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and hydroxyurea. He also has a history of nephrotic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Leukostasis: The patient's profound leukocytosis may lead to leukostasis, a condition where the high white blood cell count can cause blood clots to form in small blood vessels, potentially leading to organ damage or failure.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient's D-dimer test was negative, the possibility of a PE cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's history of CMML and the presence of a right-sided pulmonary infiltrate.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient's recent diagnosis of C. difficile infection and treatment with vancomycin may lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which could worsen his condition.
5. Right-sided pleural effusion: The patient's small right pleural effusion may worsen if not treated promptly, potentially leading to respiratory distress.
6. Nephrotic syndrome: The patient's history of nephrotic syndrome and membranous nephropathy may lead to kidney damage or failure if not managed properly.
7. Steroid-induced complications: The patient's history of steroid use for presumed COPD exacerbation may lead to steroid-induced complications, such as osteoporosis, diabetes, or hypertension.
8. Leukemia progression or transformation: The patient's CMML may progress or transform into a more aggressive form, potentially leading to a worsening of his condition.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CMML), was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress, leukocytosis, and confirmed C. difficile infection. He had received an extended course of antibiotics at an outside hospital but remained significantly worse than baseline, raising concerns for an unusual pathogen such as fungal etiology or interstitial lung disease. A bronchoscopy was planned to determine the diagnosis.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 104K, trending down to 77K on the day of transfer. He was on hydroxyurea, a medication used to treat leukemia. His chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening, consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration.

The patient's medical history included CMML, diagnosed in [**2178**], and managed conservatively with close monitoring. He had not received chemotherapy for this condition. He also had a history of cyclophosphamide treatment for membranous nephropathy, which may be related to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and multifocal infection or aspiration on his chest CT scan increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's C. difficile infection and multifocal infection or aspiration on his chest CT scan increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Leukostasis: The patient's leukocytosis and decrease in white blood cell count may increase the risk of leukostasis, a condition characterized by the aggregation of white blood cells in the blood vessels, which can lead to organ failure.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's multifocal infection or aspiration on his chest CT scan may increase the risk of pulmonary edema, a condition characterized by excess fluid in the lungs.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and potential nephrotoxic effects of antibiotics increase the risk of renal failure.
6. Infection: The patient's C. difficile infection and multifocal infection or aspiration on his chest CT scan increase the risk of infection, particularly in the lungs, urinary tract, and bloodstream.
7. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and potential nephrotoxic effects of antibiotics increase the risk of hemorrhage, particularly in the kidneys.
8. Anemia: The patient's history of CMML and potential bleeding complications increase the risk of anemia.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of CMML and potential bleeding complications increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by a low platelet count.
10. Malignant transformation: The patient's history of CMML and potential transformation to a more aggressive form of leukemia increase the risk of malignant transformation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.

   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]

   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to hypoxic respiratory distress. He has been treated with antibiotics for a possible bacterial pneumonia, but his condition has not improved. The patient's white blood cell count has increased, and he has developed leukocytosis. He also has a rectal mass that was biopsied at an outside hospital. The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and has been treated with flagyl. He has a history of chronic renal failure and has been managed conservatively with close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan is consistent with multifocal infection, and he has received an extended course of antibiotics. However, his condition has not improved, and there is a concern for an unusual pathogen such as fungal etiology or interstitial lung disease such as PAP.
2. Leukostasis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased, and he has developed leukocytosis. Leukostasis is a possibility, although his WBC count is decreasing.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a high likelihood of developing PE due to his history of CMML and the presence of chronic renal failure.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and has been treated with flagyl. However, he may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent recurrence.
5. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and may require further management and monitoring to prevent progression.
6. Rectal Mass: The patient has a rectal mass that was biopsied at an outside hospital. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the cause and extent of the mass.
7. Leukemia: The patient has a history of CMML, and his condition may be worsening. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the best course of action.

Recommendations:

1. Bronchoscopy: The patient should undergo bronchoscopy to determine the cause of his hypoxic respiratory distress and to rule out other possible causes such as PAP or PE.
2. Blood Cultures: The patient should have blood cultures taken to determine if there is a bacterial infection.
3. Imaging Studies: The patient should undergo imaging studies such as a CT scan of the chest and abdomen to evaluate for other possible causes of his symptoms.
4. Leukocyte Count Monitoring: The patient's leukocyte count should be monitored regularly to determine if it is decreasing or increasing.
5. C. difficile Infection Treatment: The patient should be treated with flagyl for his C. difficile infection and should be monitored for recurrence.
6. Chronic Renal Failure Management: The patient should be managed conservatively with close monitoring to prevent progression of his chronic renal failure.
7. Rectal Mass Evaluation: The patient's rectal mass should be further evaluated to determine the cause and extent of the mass."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.
   FEN: NPO for bronchoscopy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) who is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 87 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 122/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* White blood cell count: 104.8 cells/μL

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including a trans-thoracic echo, ultrasound, and chest computed tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan shows multifocal mostly dependent ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening associated with small bilateral pleural effusion, consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration.

The patient is being treated with antibiotics, hydroxyurea, and other medications. He is also receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacterial or fungal pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan is consistent with multifocal infection, and he has received an extended course of antibiotics.
2. Leukostasis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased significantly, and leukostasis remains a possibility.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest CT scan shows signs of small airway disease and mild centrilobular emphysema, which could contribute to pulmonary edema.
4. Intertstitial lung disease (ILD): The patient's chest CT scan shows signs of ILD, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including CMML, radiation therapy, or environmental exposures.
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's chest CT scan is negative for PE, but it is still possible that he could develop a PE.
6. Sepsis: The patient's infection could lead to sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped significantly, and he may require blood transfusions.
8. Nephrotic syndrome: The patient has a history of membranous nephropathy, which could lead to nephrotic syndrome.
9. C. difficile colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is being treated with antibiotics.
10. Transformation of leukemia: The patient's CMML could transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which would require urgent treatment.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Bronchoscopy to determine the cause of the patient's hypoxic respiratory distress.
2. Monitoring for potential complications, including bacterial or fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, pulmonary edema, ILD, and PE.
3. Treatment with antibiotics, hydroxyurea, and other medications as necessary.
4. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and anemia.
5. Management of nephrotic syndrome and C. difficile colitis.
6. Follow-up with oncology and other specialists as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at

   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.
   FEN: NPO for bronchoscopy.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) who was transferred to the ICU for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress. He has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a trans-thoracic echo, LE ultrasound, and chest CT, which revealed multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration. The patient's WBC count has decreased from 104K to 77K with hydroxyurea treatment. He has also been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and has a rectal mass biopsy pending. The patient's condition remains unstable, and further diagnostic tests and treatments are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and further diagnostic tests, such as bronchoscopy, are needed to determine the underlying cause of his hypoxia.
2. Leukostasis: The patient's WBC count has decreased, but the possibility of leukostasis remains, especially given his history of CMML.
3. Fungal Infection: The patient's chest CT is consistent with multifocal infection, and fungal etiology is a possibility, especially given his prolonged antibiotic treatment.
4. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient's chest CT also suggests ILD, such as Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), which may be contributing to his hypoxia.
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient's workup has been negative for PE, this possibility cannot be ruled out entirely.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely dilutional and may be exacerbated by hydroxyurea treatment.
7. Nephrotic Syndrome: The patient has a history of membranous nephropathy, and his kidney function should be closely monitored.
8. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): The patient's high WBC count and decreased WBC count with hydroxyurea treatment suggest the possibility of TLS, which may require further monitoring and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Bronchoscopy: The patient should undergo bronchoscopy to determine the underlying cause of his hypoxia and to rule out infectious etiologies.
2. Fungal Testing: The patient should be tested for fungal infections, including beta-glucan and galactomannan levels.
3. Hydroxyurea: The patient should continue hydroxyurea treatment to manage his leukostasis and CMML.
4. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitoring: The patient's TLS labs should be closely monitored, and treatment should be initiated if necessary.
5. Renal Function Monitoring: The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored, and renally dose medications should be adjusted as necessary.
6. Anemia Management: The patient's anemia should be closely monitored, and treatment should be initiated if necessary.
7. Nephrotic Syndrome Management: The patient's nephrotic syndrome should be managed with renally dose medications and close monitoring of kidney function."
