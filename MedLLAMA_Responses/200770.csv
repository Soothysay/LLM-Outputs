   86 yo Iranian (farsi speaking) male with h/o COPD (on home o2 (uses
   2-3h qdaily of home o2 overall), HTN, restless leg syndrome, BPH
   transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure:  Improving on
   Bipap.  Patient was initiated on Bipap after transfer to ICU and
   achieved RR around 40 and MV around 30.  Patient also recieved one dose
   of narcan.  After 2 hrs, patient's ABG improved to 7.25/64/97.  Patient
   has been more awake and agitated -- a sign that his mental status
   improving.  At Patient's ABG this afternoon was consistent with acute
   on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient is on home O2 and
   has had previosu Bicarbs around 33 per chem 7s.  Patient's change in
   mental status related to hypercarbia.  Patient's decreased ventilation
   is from decreased respiratory drive from increased NC oxygen,
   narcotics, and possibly from constipation.  Patient
s CXR with possible
   bronchitis, given his cough and shortness of breath prior to the
   admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male who was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The patient has been on BiPap therapy and has shown improvement in his respiratory status, with a decrease in his respiratory rate and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2). However, he remains on oxygen therapy and has received a dose of narcan.

The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, which is an increase from his baseline level of 1.8-2.0 mg/dL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 41 mg/dL, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck, no jugular venous distension, and no carotid bruits. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continue BiPap therapy and transition to nasal cannula (NC) oxygen.
2. Recheck arterial blood gas (ABG) levels in the afternoon.
3. Administer solumedrol 125mg IV every 6 hours for acute kidney injury.
4. Continue azithromycin 500mg IV every 24 hours.
5. Avoid sedating medications and provide pain control as needed.
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory compromise and consider prn narcan.
7. Continue foley catheter and IV fluids.
8. Monitor electrolyte levels and follow up on laboratory results.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level may continue to rise, leading to further kidney damage or failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and acute kidney injury may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and hypercarbic respiratory failure may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and history of BPH may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of COPD, hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was started on BiPap overnight and is currently stable on 3L nasal cannula. His mental status is improving, and his baseline PCO2 is around 70-80. He has acute on chronic renal failure, which is improving with IV fluids. His anemia is being monitored, and he is NPO for now. He is also being managed for restless leg syndrome and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure could progress to acute kidney injury (AKI), which could require dialysis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
4. Restless Leg Syndrome: The patient's restless leg syndrome could worsen, leading to decreased mobility and increased risk of falls.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his respiratory failure and renal failure, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and renal failure could increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he requires invasive procedures or surgery.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and chronic kidney disease could increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and use of BiPap could increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of BiPap could increase his risk of developing VAP, which could be life-threatening.
10. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and renal failure could increase his risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially treated with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and showed improvement. However, he became agitated and was taken off BiPAP, resulting in a rise in carbon dioxide levels. He was then placed on a Narcan drip, which stabilized his carbon dioxide levels.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with clear breath sounds and no signs of respiratory distress. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his extremities are warm. His neurological examination is normal, with the exception of muscle wasting and an inability to stand.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL. His creatinine level is 2.2 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 41 mg/dL, and his serum lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's plan includes continued treatment with BiPAP, recheck of his arterial blood gas (ABG) levels, and initiation of steroids for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He will also be given antibiotics for possible pneumonia and will have his Foley catheter inserted to monitor his urine output.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major concern, and he may require continued treatment with BiPAP or mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, but he may be at risk for hypotension due to his chronic kidney disease and potential fluid overload.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of antibiotics suggest that he may have an infection.
5. Constipation: The patient's history of restless leg syndrome and his current treatment with narcan may increase his risk of constipation.
6. Pain management: The patient's history of methadone use and his current treatment with fentanyl may increase his risk of respiratory compromise.
7. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if he is not treated with BiPAP or mechanical ventilation.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he is not treated with blood transfusions or if his underlying cause is not addressed.
9. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if he is not treated with dialysis or if his underlying cause is not addressed.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment to address his respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and other potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) pressure of 25 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 8.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 167 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.2 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 29 mmHg
* Glucose: 102 mg/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a target tidal volume of 300-400 mL and a respiratory rate of 12-15 breaths per minute. His ABG results show a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 70 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 69 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right digital pulse not assessed, and left digital pulse not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue BiPAP as needed
* Recheck ABG
* Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs
* Continue Azithromycin 500mg IV q24
* Narcan gtt with intermittent Fentanyl boluses
* Discontinue foley catheter
* Continue NS @ 100cc/hr while NPO
* Continue Tamsulosin and Finasteride
* Hold home lasix
* Follow lytes/chemistries
* Monitor for anemia and microcytic indices
* Hold standing methadone and consider prn fentanyl
* DVT prophylaxis with SQ Heparin and PPI
* Bowel regimen with miralax
* Pain management with prn Fentanyl as necessary
* Watch for respiratory compromise

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Sepsis
* Pulmonary embolism
* Hypoglycemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hyperphosphatemia

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent or address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male who was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 160/69 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished, with normal eyes, head, and neck. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal heart rhythm and no murmurs. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is normal, with palpable radial and dorsalis pedis pulses. The patient's respiratory examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and his abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, microcytic, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are normal, with a normal alkaline phosphatase level.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's change in mental status is related to hypercarbia, and his decreased ventilation is due to decreased respiratory drive from increased NC oxygen, narcotics, and possibly from constipation.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 2.6 mg/dL to 1.8 mg/dL, suggesting pre-renal likely etiology. The patient's history of poor oral intake and BPH may contribute to this condition.
* Restless leg syndrome: The patient's symptoms are controlled on home dose methadone, and he is encouraged to engage in more physical activity.
* Anemia, microcytic: The patient has a history of thalassemia, and his hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL.
* Foley catheter: The patient has a foley catheter in place due to suspected retention secondary to BPH.
* Medications: The patient is receiving azithromycin, lorazepam, and fentanyl, among other medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition may deteriorate if his respiratory drive does not improve, leading to further hypercarbia and respiratory failure.
* Progression of acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level may continue to rise if his pre-renal condition is not managed properly, leading to further kidney damage.
* Development of respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if he does not improve his respiratory drive, leading to respiratory failure.
* Development of sepsis: The patient's history of COPD and BPH may increase his risk of developing sepsis, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of BPH and constipation may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if he does not improve his bowel habits."

   (due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs
   rather than 5mg tabs from his pharmacy).  He required BiPAP the first
   day in the ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was
   started on a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.
   His narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert and
   speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan while in the
   ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless leg syndrome.  He
   was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which was continued x2 days.
   It was later discontinued to help further clear his mental status.  He
   was also started on azithromycin 500mg IV q24 for COPD exacerbation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male with a history of COPD, hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, who was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to methadone overdose. The patient was found to be taking 30mg of methadone instead of 15mg, which led to his respiratory failure. He was treated with BiPAP, narcan, and ativan, and his mental status improved. He was also started on azithromycin for COPD exacerbation and had his home dose of methadone restarted. The patient has an acute on chronic renal failure, which is pre-renal in etiology, and his creatinine improved from 2.6 to 1.8-2.0 during admission. He has anemia, microcytic, likely due to thalessemia, and his HCT has been stable during admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but he may still be at risk for further complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory acidosis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is pre-renal in etiology, and his creatinine has improved, but he may still be at risk for further complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia, microcytic, may be a chronic condition, and he may need ongoing management and monitoring to prevent complications.
4. Restless leg syndrome: The patient's restless leg syndrome may continue to be a problem, and he may need ongoing management and monitoring to prevent complications.
5. Methadone withdrawal: The patient may still be experiencing withdrawal symptoms from the methadone overdose, and he may need ongoing management and monitoring to prevent complications.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, due to his respiratory failure and COPD exacerbation.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as DVT or PE, due to his immobilization and COPD.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or diarrhea, due to his COPD exacerbation and medication use.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias, due to his COPD exacerbation and medication use.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but he is still at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

   Patient
s mental status is at baseline now oriented to self and yr by
   his calendar. This was thought to  be secondary to methadone overdose
   (due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs
   rather than 5mg tabs from his pharmacy).  He required BiPAP the first
   day in the ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was
   started on a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.
   His narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert and
   speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan while in the
   ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless leg syndrome.  He
   was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which was continued x2 days.
   It was later discontinued to help further clear his mental status.  He
   was also started on azithromycin 500mg IV q24 for COPD exacerbation
   which was switched to PO on [**2140-4-9**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old Iranian male with a history of COPD, hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and BPH, who was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to methadone overdose. He was found to be taking 30mg of methadone instead of 15mg due to receiving 10mg tabs from his pharmacy instead of 5mg. He required BiPAP on the first day and was started on a narcan gtt with improvement in his respiratory status. He was also given fentanyl boluses and ativan to help with withdrawal and restless leg syndrome. His narcan gtt was discontinued, and he was started on Solumedrol and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Improving.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Pre-renal: Improved with IVFs.
3. Restless Leg Syndrome: Controlled on home dose methadone, but will hold standing methadone for now and consider prn fentanyl.
4. Anemia, Microcytic: Has a history of thalassemia, and will monitor.
5. FEN: NPO for now.
6. Access: PIV.
7. PPx: DVT ppx with SQ Heparin, PPI.
8. Bowel regimen with miralax.
9. Pain management with prn Fentanyl as necessary, watch for respiratory compromise.
10. Code: Full code.
11. Disposition: Pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying COPD and potential for hypoventilation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but he may still be at risk for further decline due to his underlying kidney disease and potential for pre-renal azotemia.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of thalassemia and may be at risk for sepsis due to his compromised immune system.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his compromised immune system and potential for respiratory and urinary tract infections.
5. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia and potential for bleeding complications from his heparin therapy.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalance due to his underlying kidney disease and potential for electrolyte disturbances from his medications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying kidney disease and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding from his medications.
8. Respiratory compromise: The patient is at risk for respiratory compromise due to his underlying COPD and potential for hypoventilation.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias due to his underlying heart disease and potential for arrhythmias from his medications.
10. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to his underlying neurological disease and potential for neurological complications from his medications."
