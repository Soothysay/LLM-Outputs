   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen (note: only 2 of the
   lumens can be used)
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, will
   reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run VT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   *************************************
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis vs. DKA. Serum tox
   negative. Patient does not take metformin as outpatient. Delta-delta
   1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   - Treat possible DKA: Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**], replete K > 3.3,
   follow-up serum ketones
   - Lactic Acidosis: repleted bicarb total 250 meq
   - Increase vent RR to compensate metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - For now attempt Lasix bolus and drip for diuresis
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Currently GS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation and
   cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -overall very poor prognosis
   -neuro team to follow, appreciate input
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab.
   - send urine lytes
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed.
   FEN: NPO
   .
   ACCESS: Femoral vein and arterial cath.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sq
   -Pain management with sedation
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace
   -Famotidine 20 mg IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prior stroke. He presented with a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral depressions. A cardiac catheterization demonstrated acute thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) and a chronic totally occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery with collaterals. The patient was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and a bare metal stent in the RCA.

The patient remains unstable with cardiogenic shock, requiring multiple pressors, balloon pump, and temperature control. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. He is intubated and on a ventilator, with a patchy infiltrate on his chest X-ray consistent with edema secondary to cardiogenic shock.

The patient's neurological status is poor, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 and decorticate posturing. He has a history of stroke and is currently unable to be assessed for mental status due to sedation and cooling.

The patient's laboratory results show an anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation, likely due to lactate acidosis or DKA. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine are elevated, consistent with acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest are ongoing complications that require close monitoring and management.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a patchy infiltrate on his chest X-ray and a need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's poor neurological status and history of stroke make him at risk for further neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring and management, including the need for dialysis.
5. Acid-Base Disorders: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis requires treatment, and the possibility of DKA or lactic acidosis needs to be considered.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, likely due to his cardiogenic shock and cooling, requires close monitoring and management.
7. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and multiple invasive lines make him at risk for sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing management of his cardiogenic shock, respiratory distress, and neurological status. He needs close monitoring of his acid-base disorders, coagulopathy, and renal function. The patient's family should be updated regularly on his status, and a family meeting should be held to discuss his poor prognosis and potential treatment options."

   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Increase vent RR to help with metabolic acidosis compensation

   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl

   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Increase vent RR to help with metabolic acidosis compensation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a past medical history of diabetes, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD). He presented with a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads and anterolateral depression. A coronary angiogram revealed a chronic totally occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery with collaterals, a small circumflex artery, and an acute distally occluded right coronary artery (RCA). A bare metal stent was placed in the RCA.

The patient is currently intubated and on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50. He is also receiving a balloon pump and has a temporary wire in place. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he has a severe decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex.

The patient has a history of poor memory and is not taking diabetes medications. He has a baseline creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and his current creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. He is also experiencing hyperglycemia and acid-base disorders, including metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and he is at risk for respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, and he is at risk for further deterioration in renal function, including need for dialysis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of stroke and is at risk for further neurological deterioration, including seizures, cerebral edema, or brain herniation.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient has hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, and he is at risk for further metabolic derangements, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (HONK).
6. Infection complications: The patient has a central line and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
7. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, and he is at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
8. Thrombotic complications: The patient has a history of PAD and is at risk for thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Wean epinephrine today, then dopamine as tolerated.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   - Increase PEEP to 16 as PO2 on most recent gas 66
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed
   - f/u urine lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen (note: only 2 of the
   lumens can be used)
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, will
   reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run VT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male who was resuscitated from cardiac arrest following a STEMI. He was found to have acute thrombus in the RCA and underwent stenting. He remains unstable, requiring multiple pressors, a balloon pump, and temporary wire. He is intubated and on ventilator support, with a FiO2 of 80%. He has a history of DM, CVA, and PAD.

The patient's cardiac status is critical, with a severely depressed LVEF (25%) and global hypokinesis. He is in cardiogenic shock, with a PCWP of 33 mmHg and a MAP of 50 mmHg. He is on multiple pressors, including levophed, epinephrine, and vasopressin.

The patient's respiratory status is also critical, with a patchy infiltrate on CXR and a high risk of worsening pulmonary edema. He is on ventilator support with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a PEEP of 14 cmH2O.

The patient's neuro status is also critical, with a GCS of 3 and decorticate posturing. He is being treated for non-convulsive status epilepticus with Keppra and midazolam.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium, weaning off now slowly
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen

   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, and now
   making urine productively, will reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

   DISPO: CCU for now. Poor prognosis. Family meeting was yesterday; will
   follow-up today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a past medical history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and a prior stroke. He was admitted to the ICU after suffering a cardiac arrest due to a STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral depressions. The patient has been intubated and is on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50.

The patient has been experiencing various complications, including:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock due to cardiac arrest and STEMI, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 53% and a PCWP of 33.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has a patchy infiltrate on his chest X-ray, consistent with edema secondary to cardiogenic shock. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has insulin resistance, which could be part of the sympathomimetic treatment and overall ischemic state.
5. Acid-base disorder: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation, likely due to lactate acidosis.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and decorticate posturing. He is experiencing status epilepticus, as evidenced by EEG, and is being treated with keppra and midazolam.
7. Cooling protocol: The patient is currently in the warming phase of the Arctic sun cooling protocol.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Worsening cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock could worsen if the underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly given his immunosuppressed state.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status could deteriorate if not managed properly.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia could lead to hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's acid-base disorder could lead to electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family has been informed of this. A family meeting was held yesterday, and the patient's condition will be followed up on today."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed
   .
   FEN: NPO; consider when to start feeding patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium, weaning off now slowly
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, and now
   making urine productively, will reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic yesterday
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run NSVT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   DISPO: CCU for now. Poor prognosis. Family meeting was yesterday; will
   follow-up today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) with stents. He presented with cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed acute thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a prior bare metal stent, and a chronic totally occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery with collaterals.

The patient is currently intubated and on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mmHg. He has a balloon pump in place and is being weaned off vent and pressors. The patient has a history of poor memory and complaints of poor memory, which may be related to his prior CVA.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac arrest and STEMI, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%.
2. Respiratory distress with a patchy infiltrate on the chest X-ray (CXR), likely due to cardiogenic shock and edema.
3. Acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion, with a baseline creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL and a current creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL.
4. Hyperglycemia, possibly related to insulin resistance and sympathomimetic treatment.
5. Acid-base disorder, with an anion gap metabolic acidosis and inadequate compensation.
6. Neurological status, with poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and decorticate posturing, and a diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) based on EEG.

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

1. Pressors (levophed, epinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin) to maintain a MAP of 50 mmHg.
2. Insulin drip to manage hyperglycemia.
3. Lasix drip and thiazide diuretic to manage fluid overload and acute renal failure.
4. Amiodarone to manage arrhythmias.
5. Keppra and midazolam to manage NCSE.
6. Heparin drip for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient is at high risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Worsening cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.
2. Pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury and need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Hyperglycemic crisis and DKA.
5. Seizures and status epilepticus.
6. Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the physician has discussed this with the family. A family meeting was held yesterday, and the patient's condition will be re-evaluated today."

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   I was present during the entire portion of the
   physical examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 year old man who suffered an inferior wall STEMI
   complicated by cardiogenic shock earlier this AM.  He was treated with
   PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA following thrombectomy with the
   support of a pacemaker and IABP.
   He was cooled for 24 hours for neuro protection and is now warm.  There
   has been no return in her neurologic function.  His IABP was removed
   for leg leg ischemia and he is currently on reduced pressor
   requirements.  This resulted in a doppler left popliteal and faint PT
   pulse. He is urinating > 100 cc clear urine per hour.
   We have continued all aggressive supportive care until his prognosis in
   better defined tomorrow.
   His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain and this has
   been discussed with his wife and family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium, weaning off now slowly
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, and now
   making urine productively, will reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic yesterday
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run NSVT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec

   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   I was present during the entire portion of the
   physical examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 year old man who suffered an inferior wall STEMI
   complicated by cardiogenic shock earlier this AM.  He was treated with
   PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA following thrombectomy with the
   support of a pacemaker and IABP.
   He was cooled for 24 hours for neuro protection and is now warm.  There
   has been no return in her neurologic function.  His IABP was removed
   for leg leg ischemia and he is currently on reduced pressor
   requirements.  This resulted in a doppler left popliteal and faint PT
   pulse. He is urinating > 100 cc clear urine per hour.
   We have continued all aggressive supportive care until his prognosis in
   better defined tomorrow.
   His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain and this has
   been discussed with his wife and family.

   on:[**2194-10-28**] 20:14 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the key information as follows:

**Cardiovascular:**

* The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of DM, prior CVA, and cardiac arrest (PEA) due to a STEMI.
* He was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm and was treated with PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA.
* He is currently intubated and on pressors with a balloon pump, being slowly weaned off vent and pressors.
* His cardiac arrest is likely secondary to unstable VT and RCA RV infarct.
* He has RV infarct and is in cardiogenic shock.

**Neurological:**

* The patient has poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
* He was treated with Keppra and midazolam for non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is ongoing.
* His EEG shows non-convulsive status epilepticus.

**Respiratory:**

* The patient is intubated and on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 24, and PEEP of 14 cmH2O.
* He has a patchy infiltrate on his CXR, likely due to edema secondary to cardiogenic shock.

**Renal:**

* The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
* He is currently on a lasix drip and thiazide diuretic with urine output.
* His creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL.

**Metabolic:**

* The patient has hyperglycemia with an insulin resistance picture.
* He is being treated with an insulin drip and has a serum glucose level of 224 mg/dL.
* His acid-base status is anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is at risk for further cardiogenic shock due to his underlying cardiac conditions and continued pressor support.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying cardiogenic shock and potential for worsening pulmonary edema.
3. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for further renal failure due to his underlying acute renal failure and continued fluid overload.
4. Neurological decline: The patient is at risk for further neurological decline due to his ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus and potential for further ischemic injury.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his prolonged hospitalization and underlying cardiogenic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications due to his prolonged hospitalization and potential for further fluid overload.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to his underlying cardiogenic shock and potential for further coagulopathy.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Continue aggressive supportive care, including pressor support, balloon pump, and ventilation.
* Re-evaluate the patient's cardiac function and consider further interventions, such as cardioversion or IABP removal.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further interventions, such as EEG monitoring or sedation.
* Re-evaluate the patient's renal function and consider further interventions, such as CVVH or diuretic therapy.
* Continue to monitor the patient's metabolic status and consider further interventions, such as insulin therapy or bicarbonate administration.
* Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's prognosis and potential for long-term recovery."
