You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation with pulmonary congestion, recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and a hip fracture six weeks ago. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to failure to thrive and hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 96.8°C (36°C)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has been experiencing mild intermittent hypoxia, which is likely related to a large unilateral effusion of unclear etiology. The patient has been prescribed oxygen therapy and will undergo thoracentesis tomorrow.

The patient's mental status has been reported as slightly worse over the past week, with possible contributing factors including mild hypoxia, worsening subdural hematoma, pain, and stool impaction. The patient's electrolytes are normal, with the exception of mild hypernatremia.

The patient has been prescribed medications for atrial fibrillation, including metoprolol, and will undergo a repeat echo and head CT scan. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is pending further work-up and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia and unilateral effusion may be related to pneumonia.
2. Aspiration: The patient's history of hip fracture and subdural hematoma may increase the risk of aspiration.
3. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and hypernatremia may be indicative of sepsis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, and the patient may be at risk for other cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and unilateral effusion may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stool impaction and history of hip fracture may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of hip fracture and immobility may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and history of hip fracture may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of acute on chronic subdural hematoma, hip fracture, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening subdural hematoma, hypotension, and altered mental status. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 96.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg. He is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. His respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 99% on 2L nasal cannula oxygen. His physical examination reveals a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer and diminished lung sounds on the right side.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's intermittent hypoxia may worsen if his lung collapse is not adequately managed. Thoracentesis and repeat CT scans are planned to further evaluate the cause of the effusion.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be caused by worsening subdural hematoma, pain, stool impaction, or infectious process. Repeat head CT scans, neuro checks, and pain control measures are planned to address this issue.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to arrhythmias and worsen his condition. Close monitoring and medication adjustments are planned to manage this condition.
4. Stool Impaction: The patient's stool impaction has been resolved, but further bowel regimen measures are planned to prevent recurrence.
5. Hip Fracture: The patient's hip fracture may lead to further complications, such as pneumonia and DVT. Prophylactic measures are planned to prevent these complications.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray reveals a large unilateral effusion, which may be secondary to pneumonia or aspiration. Thoracentesis and repeat CT scans are planned to further evaluate the cause of the effusion.
7. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fever may be indicative of an underlying infection. Repeat cultures and antibiotics are planned to address this issue.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and decreased ejection fraction may lead to cardiac complications, such as congestive heart failure. Close monitoring and medication adjustments are planned to manage this condition.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I have seen and examined Mr [**Known lastname 11339**] and concur with the note above.
   His mental status is improved with hydration and he continues to have
   features of a large right sided pleural effusion but stable O2
   requirements. He will need a thoracentesis provided BP/ HR are stable
   and he is somewhat co-operative for the procedure. I suspect this is a
   parapneumonic effusion given that his CXR was clear in the right lung
   filed in [**9-1**]. We will continue strict aspiration precautions and have
   a PICC lined placed for the eventuality of TPN until S/S has been
   reassessed and he is safe to eat.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 99% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology, however given the time course this is most likely
   conistent with parapneumonic effusion due to PNA / aspiration.   Much
   less likely to be secondary to CHF, but will repeat TTE due to prior EF
   of 30%.
   - thoracentesis today
   -F/u Blood cultures
   - repeat echo
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. 2Possible causes are worsening SDH vs pain vs.
   stool impaction vs. infectious process. No electrolyte disturbances at
   this point.
   - Vanc/Zosyn above

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, and a recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma. The patient is currently in the ICU with a large right-sided pleural effusion, which is likely secondary to parapneumonic effusion due to pneumonia or aspiration.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36°C (96.8°F)
* Heart rate: 85 bpm (with a range of 82-128 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/51 mmHg (with a range of 76-142/90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99% on 2L of oxygen

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Awake and more responsive
* HEENT: Normal
* Neck: Supple
* Pulmonary: No labored breathing, no crackles, absent lung sounds on the left side, and diminished lung sounds on the right side
* Cardiac: Regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs
* Abdomen: Firm, lumpy, and mildly tender
* Extremities: No abnormalities
* Skin: Stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer
* Neurologic: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with more fluent speech

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.1%
* Platelet count: 282 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Hypoxia: Mildly intermittently hypoxic, with a large unilateral pleural effusion of unclear etiology.
* Altered mental status: Slightly worsening over the past week, with possible causes including worsening subdural hematoma, pain, stool impaction, or infectious process.
* Atrial fibrillation: With a heart rate of 100 bpm, and a history of torsades on a previous admission.
* Stool impaction: Resolved, but with a risk of recurrence.
* Hip fracture: Six weeks ago, with ongoing pain and potential for further complications.
* Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, hold heparin sc until negative head CT, pneumoboots, and aspiration precautions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Thoracentesis to drain the pleural effusion
* Repeat head CT in 24 hours to assess the subdural hematoma
* Hold aspirin and repeat echo to monitor for cardiac complications
* Continue Vanc/Zosyn for potential aspiration or pneumonia
* Monitor electrolyte levels and adjust bowel regimen as needed
* Continue pain control with Tylenol PRN
* Repeat echo to monitor cardiac function
* Consider placing a PICC line for future TPN use
* Hold sedating medications and monitor for signs of delirium
* Continue strict aspiration precautions and ground solids to prevent aspiration."

   HPI: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old with tachy-brady w/PCM, recent acute on
   chronic SDH, hip fx 6 weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and
   hypoxia. Per ED report and NH notes, patient was 92% on RA at the NH.
   He has lost 15-20 lbs in the past 6 weeks with poor PO intake. Per
   family history, his mental status prior to recent hospitalizations was
   good, able to converse, visiting friends. Since hip fracture, his
   mental status has decreased, frequently disoriented but intermittently
   answering questions. However, the son reports that his mental status
   seems to have worsened over the past week and that he seems to be
   grimacing in pain as well.
   .
   Of note his was admitted from [**Date range (2) 11311**] for right hip fracture,
   SHD and an episode of torsades. Torsades may have been due to
   florouquinolones, which were subsequently avoided. EP also increased
   demand pacing to 80 and pt was started on metoprolol.  His subdural
   hematomas were followed on serial HCT and were found to be stable.
   There was also a concern for aspiration pneumonitis, although S/S eval
   cleared the pt for thicked fluids but was concerned for aspiraton.
   .
   In the ED: He was found to he in afib at 112 w/o ischemic changes,
   slightly  elevated trop at 0.04. Cardiology consulted w/o recommended
   no intervention. CT abd noted a large amount of stool and very large
   left effusion with lung collapse. He was given Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   Initially his lactate was 3.9 but improved with one liter NS to 2.0.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   CC:[**CC Contact Info 11327**]   .
   HPI: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old with tachy-brady w/PCM, recent acute on
   chronic SDH, hip fx 6 weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and
   hypoxia. Per ED report and NH notes, patient was 92% on RA at the NH.
   He has lost 15-20 lbs in the past 6 weeks with poor PO intake. Per
   family history, his mental status prior to recent hospitalizations was
   good, able to converse, visiting friends. Since hip fracture, his
   mental status has decreased, frequently disoriented but intermittently
   answering questions. However, the son reports that his mental status
   seems to have worsened over the past week and that he seems to be
   grimacing in pain as well.
   .
   Of note his was admitted from [**Date range (2) 11311**] for right hip fracture,
   SHD and an episode of torsades. Torsades may have been due to
   florouquinolones, which were subsequently avoided. EP also increased
   demand pacing to 80 and pt was started on metoprolol.  His subdural
   hematomas were followed on serial HCT and were found to be stable.
   There was also a concern for aspiration pneumonitis, although S/S eval
   cleared the pt for thicked fluids but was concerned for aspiraton.
   .
   In the ED: He was found to he in afib at 112 w/o ischemic changes,
   slightly  elevated trop at 0.04. Cardiology consulted w/o recommended
   no intervention. CT abd noted a large amount of stool and very large
   left effusion with lung collapse. He was given Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   Initially his lactate was 3.9 but improved with one liter NS to 2.0.

Summary:

The patient is a 92-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU with a history of tachy-brady syndrome, recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), and hip fracture 6 weeks ago. He presents with failure to thrive, hypoxia, and altered mental status. His mental status has worsened over the past week, and he is now drowsy, grimacing in pain, and not following commands or answering questions.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, awake, and grimacing individual with a large right-sided pleural effusion, lung collapse, and a firm, lumpy abdomen. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 282 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 9.7 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Sodium: 142 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 25 mmHg. The cause of the hypoxia is unclear, but it may be related to the large pleural effusion or aspiration pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has worsened over the past week, and he is now drowsy, grimacing in pain, and not following commands or answering questions. The cause of the altered mental status is unclear, but it may be related to the worsening SDH, hypoxia, or pain.
3. Stool impaction: The patient has a history of constipation, and his abdomen is firm and lumpy. He may have a stool impaction, which could be contributing to his abdominal pain and altered mental status.
4. Afib/arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his heart rate is currently 100 beats per minute. He may be at risk for torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has a large pleural effusion, which may be related to pneumonia. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and his white blood cell count is elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and lung collapse may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis.
3. Stroke: The patient's worsening SDH may lead to a stroke.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of torsades de pointes may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection.

Plan:

1. Continue oxygen therapy to maintain a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 60-80 mmHg.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his pain management accordingly.
3. Consider thoracentesis to drain the pleural effusion and improve lung function.
4. Start antibiotics to cover aspiration pneumonia.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider a head CT to evaluate the patient's SDH and rule out other causes of his altered mental status.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his anti-arrhythmic medication as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 96-99% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology, however given the time course this is most likely
   conistent with parapneumonic effusion due to PNA / aspiration.   Much
   less likely to be secondary to CHF, but will repeat TTE due to prior EF
   of 30%.  Malignancy is also a possibility.
   - Diagnostic thoracentesis during this hospitalization
   -F/u Blood cultures
   -Urine culture
   - f/u TTE today
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion (Day
   3)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. Possible causes are worsening SDH vs pain vs. stool
   impaction vs. infectious process. No electrolyte disturbances at this
   point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn above
   - Hold CT today due to pt. agitation, stable neuro exam
   -hold Aspirin, neuro checks q2hours
   - f/u cultures
   - follow sodium
   - pain control with Tylenol PRN
   - bowel regimen
   - f/u TTE
   - Thoracentesis as above
   -Hold sedating meds
   .
   # Afib/ arrythmias: HR 100 now; torsades on last admission
   - change toprol 25mg daily to metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] for ease of
   titration
   - avoid QTc prolonging medications
   - monitor on Tele

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation with persistent atrial flutter, recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and hip fracture six weeks ago. They were admitted with failure to thrive and hypoxia. The patient is currently more alert and responsive, with a Sao2 of 96-99% on 2L NC. They have mild abdominal pain, but no other complaints. The patient has a large unilateral effusion of unclear etiology on CT scan, which is likely parapneumonic effusion due to pneumonia/aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia/aspiration: The patient's large unilateral effusion is likely due to pneumonia/aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's mild intermittent hypoxia can worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status can be caused by various factors, including worsening subdural hematoma, pain, stool impaction, or infectious process. If not managed properly, it can lead to decreased level of consciousness and increased risk of complications.
4. Afib/arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with persistent atrial flutter can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Stool impaction: The patient's resolved stool impaction can lead to further complications if not managed properly, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or sepsis.
6. Hip fracture: The patient's hip fracture can lead to further complications, such as nonunion, malunion, or infection, if not managed properly.
7. DVT/PE: The patient's use of pneumoboots and immobility can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust therapy as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Consider diagnostic thoracentesis to determine the etiology of the effusion.
3. Continue to manage the patient's altered mental status with pain control, electrolyte monitoring, and neuro checks.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Continue to manage the patient's stool impaction with bowel regimen and monitor for signs of complications.
6. Continue to manage the patient's hip fracture with pain control and monitor for signs of complications.
7. Consider prophylaxis for DVT/PE and monitor for signs of complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 99% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology, however given the time course this is most likely
   conistent with parapneumonic effusion due to PNA / aspiration.   Much
   less likely to be secondary to CHF, but will repeat TTE due to prior EF
   of 30%.
   - thoracentesis today
   -F/u Blood cultures
   - repeat echo
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. 2Possible causes are worsening SDH vs pain vs.
   stool impaction vs. infectious process. No electrolyte disturbances at
   this point.
   - Vanc/Zosyn above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 98% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology at this point -mucus pluging? Parapneumonic [**1-25**]
   aspiration? Given relatively good oxygenation, will defer thoracentesis
   until tomorrow.
   - thoracentesis tomorrow
   - repeat echo
   - add on BNP
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. [**1-25**] mild hypoxia? Worsening SDH (missed f/u head CT
   last week)? Pain? Stool impaction? No evidence of fever or leukocytosis
   to suggest infection. UA neg. Electrolytes nl- just mildly
   hypernatremia, ? past hx of hyperosmolar hypernatremia.
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   -head CT
   - f/u cultures
   - follow sodium
   - pain control tyelnol
   - bowel regimen
   - repeat echo
   - thoracentesis
   .
   # Afib/ arrythmias: HR 100 now; torsades on last admission
   - change toprol 25mg daily to metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] for ease of
   titration
   - avoid QTc prolonging medications
   - monitor on tele
   - asa 325mg

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation with pulmonary congestion, recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and hip fracture six weeks ago. He is currently in the ICU with failure to thrive and hypoxia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, with a SpO2 of 96% on 2L of oxygen. A CT scan reveals a large unilateral effusion of unclear etiology, which may be due to mucus plugging, parapneumonic aspiration, or other causes. The patient's oxygenation is being monitored, and thoracentesis is planned for the next day.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has worsened over the past week, with mild hypoxia, worsening subdural hematoma (missed follow-up head CT), pain, and stool impaction as potential contributing factors. The patient is not following commands or answering questions.
3. Afib/arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, and torsades de pointes were noted on his previous admission. To avoid QTc prolonging medications, metoprolol has been changed to 12.5mg daily, and ASA 325mg has been prescribed.
4. Stool impaction: The patient has a stool impaction, which is being managed with miralax and enemas. Disimpaction may be necessary if these measures are unsuccessful.
5. S/p hip fracture: The patient has a history of hip fracture six weeks ago and has missed follow-up orthopedic appointments. Pain management is being addressed with tylenol.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT, VAP, and stress ulcer prophylaxis is being provided.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.7-12.9 K/uL
* Hct: 35.1-34.2%
* Plt: 282-349 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 117-74 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/30.3/1.3, Lactic Acid: 2.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.4 g/dL, Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Thoracentesis tomorrow
* Repeat echo
* Addition of BNP
* Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected HCAP/aspiration
* Head CT
* Follow-up cultures
* Monitor sodium levels
* Pain control with tylenol
* Bowel regimen
* Repeat echo
* Thoracentesis

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is pending further work-up and treatment."

Summary:

The patient is a 91-year-old man with a large right pleural effusion, chronic subdural hematoma, and heart failure (EF ~ 30%). He is unable to provide a history due to altered mental status, oriented only to his name. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and complicated parapneumonic effusion, which may be contributing to his heart failure. He is currently receiving antibiotics, lorazepam, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's large pleural effusion may continue to worsen his respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen due to the pleural effusion, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and complicated parapneumonic effusion may progress, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's subdural hematoma may continue to bleed, potentially leading to further neurological deterioration.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to provide a history and his altered mental status may lead to malnutrition and dehydration.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and altered mental status may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, potentially leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
8. Worsening anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or malnutrition, potentially leading to further complications.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's heart failure and pneumonia may lead to electrolyte imbalances, potentially exacerbating his condition.
10. Septic shock: The patient's pneumonia and complicated parapneumonic effusion may progress to septic shock, potentially leading to multi-organ failure and death."
