   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION - Patient is unclear on what medications he is on,
   but reports taking diltiazem in spite of having been told to stop
   this.  He also reports feeling weak and lightheaded since discharge.
   Most likely etiology of his bradycardia and syncope is nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   overdose.  Other possibilities include vasovagal episode or
   hypoglycemia (although admission FS was 461), arrhythmia, and
   dehydration.  Seizure unlikely given story and cardiac medications.
   Ischemia unlikely, especially with negative enzymes.  Currently on
   dopamine gtt.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated.  Goal MAP > 65, HR > 50
   - Hold beta-blocker and CCB while bradycardic
   - Orthostatic vitals
   - PT consult
   - Monitor on telemetry
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Rate control with metoprolol as needed, will hold for now given
   dopamine requirement
   - Plan for ablation, will decide on date.
   - continue coumadin
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP - No evidence of CHF on recent echo.  Has trace crackles on exam
   and chronic appearing lower extremity edema.  S/P 3L IVF at [**Hospital 1097**]
   hosp.
   - Watch O2 requirement
   - consider CXR
   BIPOLAR DISORDER - Patient on Geodon as outpatient. Concern that may be
   contributing to his bradycardia (known side effect of the medication).
   Will continue to hold for now.
   - consider psych c/s in AM
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine on discharge of 1.4, now
   2.6.  Likely related to decreased perfusion in setting of hypotension.
   Also may represent dehydration or ACEI overdose.  Did not improve with
   3L of IVF at [**Hospital1 1097**].
   - urine lytes and UA
   - consider renal ultrasound if not improving
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy
   -HISS
   BPH - Hold terazosin given hypotension
   GOUT - Continue allopurinol
   .
   HYPERKALEMIA - resolved at OSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] reflect renal dysfunction, but
   does not appear to be severe.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of syncope and hypotension. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fib, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 98 bpm (tachycardic)
* Blood pressure: 95/73 mmHg (hypotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient has atrial flutter and is being treated with dopamine to increase his blood pressure. His laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 30.9%
* Platelet count: 163 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 9.5 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 177 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardic heart rate
* Hypotension
* Bilateral crackles in the lung fields
* 2+ pitting edema in the ankles
* Strength intact in all muscle groups

The patient has a history of atrial flutter/fib and was being anticoagulated prior to admission. He was also taking metoprolol, which may be contributing to his bradycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* Hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure
* Respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Renal failure, which can be caused by the patient's atrial flutter/fib and underlying kidney disease
* Infection, which can be caused by the patient's chronic illness and immobility
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be caused by the patient's atrial flutter/fib and underlying gastrointestinal disease

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results
* Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to manage his atrial flutter/fib and blood pressure
* Consider consulting a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's atrial flutter/fib and recommend appropriate treatment
* Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and consider providing supplemental oxygen as necessary
* Consider ordering a chest x-ray to evaluate the patient's lung fields
* Consider ordering a renal ultrasound to evaluate the patient's kidney function
* Continue to provide supportive care, such as nutrition and hydration, to help manage the patient's underlying illnesses."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION - Patient is unclear on what medications he is on,
   but reports taking diltiazem in spite of having been told to stop
   this.  He also reports feeling weak and lightheaded since discharge.
   Most likely etiology of his bradycardia and syncope is nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   overdose.  Other possibilities include vasovagal episode or
   hypoglycemia (although admission FS was 461), arrhythmia, and
   dehydration.  Seizure unlikely given story and cardiac medications.
   Ischemia unlikely, especially with negative enzymes.  Currently off
   dopamine gtt.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] restart beta-blocker slowly as needed for HR control.
   - Goal to ablate on this admission.  Will do TEE under sedation and
   discuss with EP regarding ablation.
   - Orthostatic vitals
   - PT consult
   - Monitor on telemetry
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Rate control with metoprolol as needed, will hold for now given
   dopamine requirement
   - Plan for ablation this week.
   - continue coumadin
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP - No evidence of CHF on recent echo.  Has trace crackles on exam
   and chronic appearing lower extremity edema.  S/P 3L IVF at [**Hospital 1097**]
   hosp.  Has mild O2 req and outside CXR shows volume o/l.
   - 40 mg IV lasix
   BIPOLAR DISORDER - Patient on Geodon as outpatient. Concern that may be
   contributing to his bradycardia (known side effect of the medication).
   Will continue to hold for now.
   - consider psych c/s in AM
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine on discharge of 1.4, now
   2.6.  Likely related to decreased perfusion in setting of hypotension.
   Also may represent dehydration or ACEI overdose.  Did not improve with
   3L of IVF at [**Hospital1 1097**].
   - urine lytes and UA
   - consider renal ultrasound if not improving
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy
   -HISS
   BPH - Hold terazosin given hypotension
   GOUT - Continue allopurinol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION
 Secondary to AV node blockade by incorrect med
   regimen for Aflutter.
   - Currently off dopamine gtt.
   - Started BB slowly but did not respond until got 25 + 12 +25 of
   Metoprolol. Will change standing dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]>
   -  TEE neg for vegetations, plan to ablate once INR low enough. NPO
   today and d/w EP.
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Barium swallow and TEE normal, plan for ablation once INR low enough.
   - BB for rate control as needed.
   - Coumadin held, Heparin started for ablation
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP
 S/P 3L IVF at OSH, now very negative after 2 doses of IV Lasix
   40mg.  Cr stable so seems to have tolerated well.
   BIPOLAR DISORDER -  Restarted Geodon as etiology of bradycardia is
   likely AV node blockade.
   - Received PM dose and tolerated well.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine baseline 1.4, peaked at
   2.6, now 2.1.  Has not improved in last 24 hrs, ? because
   overdiuresing. Would favor allowing pt to balance himself out.
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fib, and type 2 diabetes who presented to the ICU with a syncopal episode, bradycardia, and hypotension. He was found to have an atrial flutter and was treated with metoprolol, lasix, and heparin. His blood pressure and heart rate have improved, but he remains on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of chronic renal failure and is being treated with insulin and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Flutter/ Fib: The patient's atrial flutter/fib may lead to further complications such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to further complications such as shock, cardiac arrest, and decreased organ perfusion.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremic syndrome.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and nephropathy.
6. Atrial Fibrillation Ablation: The patient's atrial fibrillation ablation may lead to further complications such as bleeding, infection, and stroke.
7. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia: The patient's use of heparin may lead to further complications such as bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis.
8. Metoprolol-Induced Bradycardia: The patient's use of metoprolol may lead to further complications such as bradycardia, heart failure, and decreased cardiac output.
9. Lasix-Induced Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's use of lasix may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and dehydration.
10. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's use of pantoprazole may lead to further complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and diarrhea."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male admitted to the ICU with atrial flutter, tachycardia, and mild hypotension. He has a history of allergies to ciprofloxacin, sulfa, penicillins, and unknown allergies to nut flavor.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 128 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/91 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure of 9 cm, regular rhythm with a tachycardic rate, and bilateral crackles and mild wheezes in the chest. He has 2+ pitting edema in his ankles and 1+ pulses in his distal extremities.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.5-6.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.5-10.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 186-163 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.6-2.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 177-105 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 24.5/85.7/2.4, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's flow sheet data shows:

* Fluid balance: -3,463 mL (total in: 1,687 mL, total out: 5,150 mL)
* Urine output: 5,150 mL
* Blood products: 5,150 mL

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Atrial flutter and tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: Bilateral crackles and mild wheezes in the chest may indicate pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: Elevated creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may lead to hypovolemia, hypotension, or cardiac compromise.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: Abnormal laboratory results for calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels may indicate electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, or other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's unknown allergies and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis or septic shock.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
