   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5118**] is an 85 yo male with CAD s/p MI, CVA, now with lower GI
   bleed for 4 days requiring 13 units of PRBCs.
   .
   1. GI bleed.  Patient admitted with ongoing lower GI bleed.  Initial
   bleeding scan at OSH on [**10-17**] revealed right sided bleeding, however
   colonoscopy x 2 failed to identify source of bleeding but there was
   concern for AVMs versus divertular bleed versus bleed proximal to the
   ileocecal valve.  Currenly hemodynamically stable with ongoing
   bleeding.  Will pursue tagged RBC today and then proceed to angiography
   versus surgery.
   - serial Hcts (q4 hours)
   - right IJ from OSH --> will need to replace in AM
   - type and cross 2 units
   - tagged RBCs today
   - Surgery consult given extent of bleed
   - GI consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], though less likely to be upper bleed
   .
   2.  CAD.  Patient has history of CAD with EF of 45%.  Cardiac cath in
   [**2118**] showed 3 vessel disease.  No history of stents per patient.  On
   Aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home.  However,
   given extensive bleed, will avoid antiplatelet therapy and
   antihypertesnives.  Got DDAVP at OSH.
   - continue atorvastatin, zetia
   - hold BB, lasix, isosorbide mononitrate
   - hold aspirin
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30 given CAD and active bleed
   - check EKG
   .
   3.  H/o stroke.  Patient has history of CVA.  However, given
   significant and prolonged bleed, will hold aggrenox.
   - hold agrenox
   4.  FEN: IVF @ 150cc/hour, NPO for now.
   5. PPx: pneumoboots.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with a 4-day history of lower GI bleeding, requiring 13 units of PRBCs. He has a history of CAD, CVA, and is currently hemodynamically stable. A tagged RBC scan was negative for active bleeding, and a surgery consult was obtained. The patient is being treated with pantoprazole and will undergo angiography or surgery. He is also being managed for CAD, with continuation of atorvastatin and zetia, and holding antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding is a significant concern, and further complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or cardiac complications may arise.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and current bleeding may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, MI, or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but further deterioration may occur due to underlying conditions or respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to his age, underlying medical conditions, and current bleeding, increasing the risk of infection.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged bleeding may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in vitamin K and iron.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's history of CVA and current bleeding may increase the risk of thrombotic complications, such as DVT or PE.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential for hypovolemic shock may lead to kidney injury or acute kidney injury.
8. Liver injury: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential for hypovolemic shock may lead to liver injury or acute liver injury.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve his chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5118**] is an 85 yo male with CAD s/p MI, CVA, now with lower GI
   bleed for 4 days requiring 13 units of PRBCs.
   1. GI bleed.  Patient admitted with ongoing lower GI bleed.  Initial
   bleeding scan at OSH on [**10-17**] revealed right sided bleeding, however
   colonoscopy x 2 failed to identify source of bleeding but there was
   concern for AVMs versus divertular bleed versus bleed proximal to the
   ileocecal valve.  Currenly hemodynamically stable with ongoing
   bleeding.  Will pursue tagged RBC today and then proceed to angiography
   versus surgery.
   - serial Hcts (q4 hours)
   - right IJ from OSH --> will need to replace in AM
   - type and cross 2 units
   - tagged RBCs today
   - Surgery consult given extent of bleed
   - GI consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], though less likely to be upper bleed
   .
   2.  CAD.  Patient has history of CAD with EF of 45%.  Cardiac cath in
   [**2118**] showed 3 vessel disease.  No history of stents per patient.  On
   Aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home.  However,
   given extensive bleed, will avoid antiplatelet therapy and
   antihypertesnives.  Got DDAVP at OSH.
   - continue atorvastatin, zetia
   - hold BB, lasix, isosorbide mononitrate
   - hold aspirin
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30 given CAD and active bleed
   - check EKG
   .
   3.  H/o stroke.  Patient has history of CVA.  However, given
   significant and prolonged bleed, will hold aggrenox.
   - hold agrenox
   4.  FEN: IVF @ 150cc/hour, NPO for now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of GI bleed, which has been ongoing for 4 days and has required 13 units of PRBCs. The patient has a history of CAD, CVA, and is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 35.7°C (96.3°F)
* HR: 83 bpm (normal range: 70-89 bpm)
* BP: 137/100 mmHg (normal range: 98/64-139/112 mmHg)
* RR: 14 inspirations per minute (normal range: 14-14 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Right facial droop
* EOMI (extraocular movements intact)
* Clear oropharynx
* Soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds
* Peripheral edema

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 9.4 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hct: 31.9% (normal range: 37-52%)
* Plt: 106 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Cr: 0.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 128 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)
* Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction
* Infection, which could be exacerbated by the patient's immunocompromised state
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, given the patient's history of CAD
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, given the patient's age and underlying medical conditions
* Renal failure, given the patient's history of CAD and potential for acute kidney injury
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or obstruction, given the patient's ongoing bleeding and history of CAD.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely
* Administer IV PPI to reduce the risk of further bleeding
* Consider tagged RBC scan and angiography to identify the source of bleeding
* Consult with surgery and GI services to determine the best course of action for managing the patient's bleeding
* Continue to provide supportive care, including IV fluids and blood products as needed
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiac complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, CVA, and MI, who was admitted with ongoing lower GI bleeding. Despite receiving 13 units of PRBCs, the patient continues to bleed, and a tagged RBC scan was negative for active bleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but requires ongoing transfusions. A total colectomy is planned for today. The patient has a history of CAD with an EF of 45%, and cardiac catheterization showed 3-vessel disease. The patient is on various medications, including aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol, which will be held or discontinued due to the active bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding is a significant risk, and further transfusions may be necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.
2. Hypovolemic shock: If the bleeding is not controlled, the patient may develop hypovolemic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's bleeding may be related to a coagulopathy, which can be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulant medications such as aspirin and warfarin.
4. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices (e.g., central lines, urinary catheter) increase the risk of infection.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent MI increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the bleeding, leading to respiratory failure or pneumonia.
7. Renal complications: The patient's bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock, which can cause acute kidney injury or worsening of existing kidney disease.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged NPO status may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in vitamins and minerals.
9. Psychological complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and illness may lead to psychological complications, such as anxiety, depression, or delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital with a gastrointestinal bleed, requiring 13 units of blood transfusion. The bleeding was localized to the ascending colon, and a colonoscopy showed several right-sided arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scattered diverticuli. The AVMs were cauterized, but the patient continued to bleed, suggesting that the bleed may be coming from another source, possibly diverticuli. The patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being evaluated by the surgery team for potential surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's bleeding has not stopped despite cauterization of the AVMs, which may indicate that the bleed is coming from another source. This increases the risk of further bleeding and potential complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 31 to 29, which may lead to anemia and further complications.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past. His current bleeding and anemia may increase his risk of cardiovascular instability and potential cardiac complications.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but his bleeding and anemia may increase his risk of respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's bleeding and anemia may increase his risk of infection, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's bleeding may be related to a coagulopathy, which could be exacerbated by his anemia and further increase his risk of bleeding.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's bleeding and anemia may increase his risk of kidney injury and potential acute kidney injury (AKI).
8. Liver dysfunction: The patient's bleeding and anemia may increase his risk of liver dysfunction and potential liver failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and anemia closely.
2. Consider transfusing additional units of packed red blood cells to maintain the patient's hemoglobin level.
3. Evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status and consider consulting cardiology for potential preoperative evaluation.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Consider antibiotics to prevent infection, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
6. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and consider consulting hematology for potential coagulopathy.
7. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider consulting nephrology for potential AKI.
8. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider consulting gastroenterology for potential liver dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: GI bleed
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85 yo male admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-17**] with BRBPR.  Initial Hct there
   31, transfused, hemodynamically stable.  Got tagged RBC scan there
   which showed bleeding localized to ascending colon.  Colonoscopy showed
   several R-sided AVMs and scattered diverticuli, no active bleeding.
   AVMs were cauterized.  Bleeding appears to have stopped temporarily
   after that, but then he rebled.  Got repeat colonoscopy which showed
   cauterized ulcers, not bleeding.  Received 13U PRBCs total while there,
   transferred here for possible surgery.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a gastrointestinal bleed requiring 13 units of blood transfusion. The patient had a tagged RBC scan at the previous hospital, which showed bleeding localized to the ascending colon. Colonoscopy revealed several right-sided AVMs and scattered diverticuli, which were cauterized. However, the patient rebled, and a repeat colonoscopy showed cauterized ulcers without active bleeding. The patient has not bled since returning from the RBC scan. The patient's Hct has decreased from 31 to 29.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: Despite cauterization of AVMs, the patient is still bleeding, which may require further interventions.
2. Blood loss anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased significantly, which may lead to anemia and its associated complications.
3. Infection: The patient's GI bleed may have led to contamination of the peritoneal cavity, increasing the risk of infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's bleeding and potential contamination of the peritoneal cavity may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone POBA, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's bleeding may have led to aspiration of gastric contents, which can cause respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Renal failure: The patient's bleeding and potential dehydration may lead to acute kidney injury or renal failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's bleeding may have led to hypovolemic shock, which can cause neurological complications, such as altered mental status or seizures.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's bleeding may have led to coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of further bleeding or thrombosis.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of complications and to adjust the treatment plan accordingly."
