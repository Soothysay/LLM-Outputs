You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of [** **] and is being treated with Diltiazem 15mg/hour IV infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 91bpm, blood pressure of 136/67mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's temperature of 101.4°F and the absence of a clear etiology for the fever may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is receiving Diltiazem, which can cause bradycardia, and the patient's heart rate is already slow. This may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 136/67mmHg, which is slightly low. The patient may be at risk for hypotension, especially if the Diltiazem infusion is increased or if the patient develops an underlying infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, but the patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory failure. The patient may require mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total fluid input of 1,754mL and a total fluid output of 1,420mL. This may indicate hemodynamic instability, which could lead to organ dysfunction.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is not receiving adequate nutrition, as evidenced by the absence of a clear plan for nutrition and the patient's laboratory results showing low albumin levels.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is 121mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. The patient may require insulin therapy to maintain glycemic control.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's temperature and vital signs closely for signs of infection.
2. Adjust the Diltiazem infusion rate to maintain a heart rate of 60-100bpm.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and administer vasopressors if necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Consider mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory rate increases or if the patient develops respiratory failure.
5. Administer fluids judiciously to maintain hemodynamic stability.
6. Develop a plan for nutrition and consider enteral nutrition if the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose level and administer insulin therapy if necessary to maintain glycemic control."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   60 y/o M s/p fall down and EtOH intox found to have comminuted
   fractures of the right tibia and the fibula.
   .
   # Afib/flutter with RVR: Patient with first ECG that looked like 2:1
   flutter and repeat after slowing down in ED that looked like A-fib.
   Likely RVR in setting of pain and EtOH intox as well as questionable
   intake of medications.  Patient is having difficulty taking PO
   medications and heart rate control was not acheived on the floor.  He
   does respond to both diltiezem and metoprolol IV.  As he was previously
   on metoprolol PO as outpatient will continue BB for AV nodal blockage.
   -Currently well rate controlled on dilt drip.
   -continue home 50mg metoprolol PO.
   - IVF PRN.
   -Holding anticoagulation in periop setting.  Likely can just start
   aspirin daily.
   -Continue to monitor for symptoms of withdraw/intox.
   -Pain control.
   -Per EP, would go for TEE/Cardioversion if rate control cannot be
   achieved with dilt drip.
   .
   # Ankle fracture: Needs to go to OR for ? staged procedure.
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - pain management with IV dilaudid.
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Preop risk assessment: Patient needs the procedure for pain control

   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];

   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after a fall down and ethanol intoxication. He has a history of comminuted fractures of the right tibia and fibula.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 136/67 mmHg. He is receiving diltiazem 15mg/hour IV and metoprolol 20mg IV, as well as 50mg PO metoprolol as an outpatient. He is also receiving IV fluids and pain management with hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and potential alcohol withdrawal, and is being monitored for symptoms of withdrawal and intoxication. He is also being treated for pain and nausea.

The patient is scheduled for a staged procedure for his ankle fracture, and the perioperative risk assessment indicates a moderate risk procedure. The patient's cardiac risk index is low, with no risk factors, and the perioperative risk of cardiac complications is estimated to be 0.4%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR is a potential risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias, and close monitoring of his cardiac rhythm is necessary.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR and his current medication regimen may increase his risk of cardiac failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding complications during the procedure.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may increase his risk of bleeding complications during the procedure.
5. Pain management: The patient's pain management regimen may need to be adjusted to ensure that he is comfortable and able to tolerate the procedure.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may increase his risk of aspiration during the procedure.
7. Alcoholic withdrawal: The patient's potential alcohol withdrawal may increase his risk of seizures, hallucinations, and other complications.
8. Infection: The patient's open fractures and potential surgical procedure may increase his risk of infection.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's potential respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, may increase his risk of morbidity and mortality.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's potential neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, may increase his risk of morbidity and mortality.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];
   100:1043)
   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male who suffered a fall and was found to have comminuted fractures of the right tibia and fibula. He was intubated and brought to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.4°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 91 bpm
* Blood pressure: 136/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.9%
* Platelet count: 83 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL
* Calcium: 9.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient is currently receiving diltiazem 15 mg/hour IV and is being monitored for rate control. He is also receiving hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain management.

The patient's medical history includes a history of alcoholism, and he is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. He is also experiencing ankle pain and discomfort.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation and flutter, which can increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Heart failure: The patient's history of heart disease and current atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR increase his risk of heart failure.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's immobility and history of falls increase his risk of pulmonary embolism.
* Infection: The patient's history of falls and immobility increase his risk of infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and current anticoagulation therapy increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient's history of heart disease and current atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR increase his risk of renal failure.
* Seizures: The patient's history of alcoholism and current withdrawal symptoms increase his risk of seizures.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing diltiazem 15 mg/hour IV for rate control
* Weaning the patient off the IV drip and converting to oral diltiazem
* Continuing pain management with hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
* Monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results
* Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjusting his medication as needed
* Considering TEE and cardioversion if the patient's rate control cannot be achieved with diltiazem drip
* Continuing to monitor the patient's withdrawal symptoms and adjusting his medication as needed."

   Assessment and Plan:

   # Afib/flutter with RVR: Patient with first ECG that looked like 2:1
   flutter and repeat after slowing down in ED that looked like A-fib.
   Likely RVR in setting of pain and EtOH intox as well as questionable
   intake of medications.   As he is currently in sinus and responsive to
   diltiazem will stick with CCB for now.  We will attempt to convert from
   drip to boluses after surgery.  Will first have to wean drip.
   -Currently well rate controlled on dilt drip. Will attempt to convert
   to boluses and then PO dilt.  [**Month (only) 8**] become moot point if patient
   tachycardia and afib resolve with pain control/surgery/clearance of
   withdrawl period.

   - IVF PRN.
   -Holding anticoagulation in periop setting.  Re-start aspirin daily.
   -Continue to monitor for symptoms of withdraw/intox.
   -Pain control.
   -Per EP, would go for TEE/Cardioversion if rate control cannot be
   achieved with dilt drip though unlikely.

   # Ankle fracture: OR today.
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - pain management with IV dilaudid.
   - NPO for now

   # Pre-op risk assessment: Patient needs the procedure for pain control
   per Ortho team. Moderate risk procedure. Ok to go from our standpoint.
   - continue rate control with IV dilt for now
   - please see below for further details of risk assessment
   .
   # ETOH withdrawl - Per patient the last drink was on [**2176-12-21**] in the
   afternoon.  ETOH level of 33 on 27^th AM labs.  Patient clearly
   withdrawing at the moment.  His elevated HR and pain are confusing the
   picture, however withdrawl is clearly playing a large roll.  He is not
   hallucinating or hypertensive.  Will continue with symptom based
   benzodiazepine administration.
   - Continue CIWA at 10mg qH as was not well controlled on 10mg q2h.
   - Serum tox from 27^th shows only benzos (likely iatrogenic and ETOH of
   33), no utox on record
   - thiamine/folate/MVI

   .
   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];
   100:1043)
   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac death.
2. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is undergoing ETOH withdrawal, which may lead to symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and hallucinations. The patient's elevated heart rate and pain may be complicating the withdrawal process.
3. Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia, which may be secondary to nutritional deficiency. This may lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to alcoholism. This may lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymosis, and epistaxis.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient has nausea and vomiting, which may be secondary to pain or ETOH withdrawal. This may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to his ETOH withdrawal, malnutrition, and underlying medical conditions. This may lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure.
8. Surgical complications: The patient is undergoing surgery for his ankle fracture, which may lead to surgical site infections, wound complications, and postoperative bleeding.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and cardiac failure.
10. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of head trauma and may be at risk for neurological complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and seizures.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's ETOH withdrawal symptoms and provide supportive care.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia, and provide treatment as necessary.
4. Manage the patient's nausea and vomiting, and provide supportive care.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as necessary.
6. Provide antibiotic prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's surgical site and provide wound care as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and provide treatment as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide treatment as necessary.
10. Provide education and support to the patient and their family regarding the patient's condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, is admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent ORIF of the right ankle and received antibiotics peri-operatively. The patient's AF has been successfully transitioned from IV to PO diltiazem, and he has remained in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) most of the night. The patient has also experienced a 14-beat run of asymptomatic VT, likely due to the combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with an irritable myocardium.

The patient is currently receiving lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, and his pain is being managed with Dilaudid PCA. He is also being treated for ETOH withdrawal with CIWA and for anemia with B12 supplementation. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to his alcoholism and will be monitored with daily CBCs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and ETOH withdrawal.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of PUD and anticoagulation therapy increase his risk for GIB.
3. Infection: The patient's surgical site and IV lines increase his risk for infection.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of AF and VT increase his risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient's macrocytic anemia may worsen if his B12 levels remain low.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if his platelet count continues to decline.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's immobility and respiratory support increase his risk for respiratory complications.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's history of ETOH abuse and anticoagulation therapy increase his risk for renal complications."

   s/p ORIF of right ankle.
   # AF with RVR: patient now successfully transitioned from diltiazem gtt
   to PO and has remained in NSR most of night.  14 beat run of isolated
   asymptomatic VT in setting of normal electrolytes likely do to
   combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with irritable myocardium.
   - rate control: PO Diltiazem and consider transitioning to 60-80 mg PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a right ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR).

The patient underwent an ORIF procedure for the right ankle fracture and received two doses of Ancef peri-operatively. He is currently receiving Lovenox 40mg SQ daily for DVT prophylaxis and Diltiazem PO 60mg QID for rate control of his AF.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C) at 17:00, which was treated with antibiotics. His blood cultures are pending. He has a 14-beat run of asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 1600, which was likely due to the combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with an irritable myocardium.

The patient's laboratory results show a macrocytic anemia in the setting of ETOH abuse, likely representing a nutritional deficiency. His B12 level is on the low end of normal, and he is being considered for B12 supplementation. His platelet count is stable, and he is being trended with daily CBC.

The patient's pain is being controlled with Dilaudid 1mg IV Q4H PRN, and he will be transitioned to PO pain medicines as his CIWA requirement abates for improved long-term control. He is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to his anticoagulation and history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued ETOH withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Development of a bleeding disorder due to his anticoagulation and history of GIB.
3. Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to his anticoagulation and history of PUD.
4. Complications related to his ankle fracture, including infection, nonunion, or malunion.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.
6. Development of a blood infection (sepsis) due to his antibiotic use and potential bacterial colonization.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 deficiency, which can exacerbate his anemia and other complications.
8. Thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is recommended that he be closely monitored in the ICU and that his treatment plan be adjusted accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  60 yom with h/o ETOH abuse admitted with right
   ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and AF with RVR now POD 1
   s/p ORIF of right ankle.
   # AF with RVR: patient now successfully transitioned from diltiazem gtt
   to PO and has remained in NSR most of night.  14 beat run of isolated
   asymptomatic VT in setting of normal electrolytes likely do to
   combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with irritable myocardium.
   - rate control: PO Diltiazem and consider transitioning to 60-80 mg PO
   QID (max 360 mg daily), consider transitioning to B-
     blockade for perioperative mortality benefit
   - ETOH withdrawal: continue CIWA as discussed below
   - pain control: as discussed below.
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal:  last drink on [**12-21**] now nearing 72 hours out
   anticipating withdrawal symptoms to subside throughout day, patient
   with decreasing CIWA requirements.
   - continue CIWA scale Diazepam 5-10 mg PO q 1 hour PRN, may space to 2
   hours as requirements decrease
   .
   # Ankle fracture: POD 1 s/p ORIF right ankle
   - pain control: Dilaudid 1 mg IV q 4 hours PRN for pain control, will
   add PO pain medicines as CIWA requirement abate for
     improved long term control
   - anticoagulation: lovenox 40 mg SQ daily
   .
   # Anemia: macrocytic anemia in setting of ETOH abuse likely
   representing nutritional deficiency.  B12 level on low end of normal as
   suspected culprit.  Remaining Fe studies WNL.
   - consider B12 supplementation
   - continue to guiac stools in setting of anticoagulation and GIB [**1-29**]
   PUD in PMH
   .
   # Throbocytopenia: likely resulting from alcoholism, remain stable
   - trend with daily CBC

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He underwent ORIF of the right ankle and is currently on antibiotics, anticoagulation, and pain management. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. He has a moderate anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely related to his ETOH abuse. He is being managed with B12 supplementation and anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.1°C, and blood cultures are pending. There is a risk of sepsis, especially with the presence of a surgical site infection.
2. ETOH withdrawal syndrome: The patient is nearing 72 hours of ETOH withdrawal and may experience withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and agitation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rhythm is unstable, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to his ETOH abuse and may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, especially with anticoagulation therapy.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for bleeding, especially with anticoagulation therapy and PUD.
7. Infection: The patient's surgical site infection and the presence of a central line increase the risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, especially temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
3. Continue ETOH withdrawal management with CIWA scale and consider transitioning to PO pain medicines as CIWA requirements decrease.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia, and consider B12 supplementation and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider transitioning to B-blockade for perioperative mortality benefit.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with PO PPI.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and consider GI prophylaxis as prescribed."

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, was admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by ethanol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation of the right ankle fracture, and received antibiotics peri-operatively. He was started on Diltiazem for atrial fibrillation and Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's pain is controlled with Hydromorphone, and he is at risk for delirium tremens.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently controlled with Diltiazem, but there is a risk of worsening of the condition, which could lead to cardiac complications.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter. Regular monitoring and prophylaxis with Lovenox are necessary to prevent this complication.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis. Regular monitoring and prophylaxis with Lovenox are necessary to prevent this complication.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and pneumonia increase his risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to prevent this complication.
5. Delirium tremens: The patient is at risk for delirium tremens due to ethanol withdrawal. Close monitoring and management with benzodiazepines are necessary to prevent this complication.
6. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to ethanol withdrawal. Close monitoring and management with anticonvulsants are necessary to prevent this complication.
7. Infection: The patient's open fracture and presence of a central venous catheter increase his risk of infection. Close monitoring of his wound and laboratory results is necessary to prevent this complication.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and malnutrition increase his risk of nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring of his nutritional status is necessary to prevent this complication."
