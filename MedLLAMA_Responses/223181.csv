You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypernatremia, and suspected pneumonia, UTI, and ARF.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 35.7Â°C (96.2Â°F)
* HR: 74 bpm (normal range 60-100 bpm)
* BP: 120/50 mmHg (normal range 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* RR: 20 inspirations per minute (normal range 12-20 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98% (normal range 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.8 (normal range 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hct: 32.0% (normal range 37-52%)
* Plt: 309 x 10^9/L (normal range 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Cr: 4.4 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-1.2 mg/dL)
* TCO2: 23 mmHg (normal range 21-32 mmHg)
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL (normal range 70-100 mg/dL)
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, differential count, and lactic acid levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her dementia and lack of cooperation. However, her skin is dry and cracked, and she has neuropathy.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypernatremia (high sodium level)
* Pneumonia
* UTI
* ARF (acute kidney injury)
* COPD
* Diabetes mellitus type 2
* Neuropathy
* Dementia
* Myasthenia gravis

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal failure
* Skin breakdown
* Wound infections
* Hyperglycemic crisis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Correction of hypernatremia with slow infusion of D5W
* Antibiotics for pneumonia and UTI
* IV fluids for ARF
* Wound care for lower extremity dry gangrene
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Monitoring for hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia
* Consultation with nephrology and other specialists as needed

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently receiving ICU level of care. Her disposition is uncertain and will depend on her progress and discussion with her PCP and family regarding goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypernatremia, and suspected pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and acute kidney injury. She has been receiving antibiotics, non-invasive ventilation, and IV fluids. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains largely unresponsive and is at risk of aspiration.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and bandemia suggest a bacterial infection, and her CXR shows infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Aspiration vs. nursing home-acquired pneumonia is a possibility.
2. Urinary tract infection: The patient's UA is consistent with a UTI, and she is receiving antibiotics.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and her baseline kidney function is unclear. Prerenal AKI is likely, and IV fluids and nephrology recommendations are being followed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has known DM2 and is at risk of hyperglycemia due to stress, infection, and steroids. Her glucose levels are being monitored, and insulin sensitivity is being assessed.
5. Lower extremity dry gangrene: The patient has neuropathy and DM2, and her dry gangrene is likely a long-term problem. Wound care is being provided.
6. Aspiration risk: The patient is at risk of aspiration due to her respiratory distress and frequent use of BIPAP. Feeding options will be discussed with the family once she is off BIPAP.
7. Thrombosis: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT and VAP.
8. Code status: The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and her family has been informed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
3. Continue IV fluids and nephrology recommendations to manage AKI.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin sensitivity as needed.
5. Provide wound care for the patient's dry gangrene.
6. Discuss feeding options with the family once the patient is off BIPAP.
7. Continue prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT and VAP.
8. Review the patient's code status with the family and healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU for management of multiple comorbidities. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for the past 24 hours, with a trend of improving respiratory function. The patient's sodium levels have been corrected, and their creatinine (Cr) levels are decreasing, indicating improvement in kidney function.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, soft abdomen, and dry gangrene in the left lower extremity. The patient's neurological examination is limited due to their unresponsiveness, but they do respond occasionally to commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and they have a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical conditions include DM, type I, and possibly sepsis, which is being managed with antibiotics and other supportive care. The patient's family is planning to transition to hospice care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated WBC count and lactate levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
2. Hyperglycemic emergencies: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels can lead to hyperglycemic emergencies, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, if not managed properly.
3. Wound complications: The patient's dry gangrene in the left lower extremity can lead to wound complications, such as infection, if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is improving, but they may still require invasive ventilation or other respiratory support to manage their respiratory status.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of DM and possibly sepsis can increase their risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities who requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old lady with COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypernatremia. The patient has been receiving non-invasive ventilation and has been tolerating mask oxygen for most of the day. Her sodium levels have been corrected from 170 to 150, and her creatinine levels are trending downwards.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute kidney injury (ARF). She has also been diagnosed with dry gangrene in her left lower extremity and is at risk for aspiration due to her respiratory distress and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F)
* Heart rate: 78 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 144/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.8
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 276 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 178 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 4.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 203 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing non-invasive ventilation
* Correcting hypernatremia slowly
* Treating pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam
* Treating UTI with antibiotics
* Monitoring for acute kidney injury
* Managing dry gangrene in the left lower extremity
* Managing hyperglycemia
* Discussing options for feeding with the patient's family
* Monitoring for signs of aspiration

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury
* Hyperglycemia
* Aspiration
* Pneumonia
* UTI
* Dry gangrene in the left lower extremity

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and she is currently receiving ICU-level care. The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has been consulted regarding her goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and known DM2. She was admitted with respiratory distress, hypernatremia, and dehydration. She has been on non-invasive ventilation and has tolerated mask oxygen for most of the day. Her sodium levels have been corrected from 170 to 150, and her creatinine levels have been trending downward. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, UTI, and ARF, and is being treated with antibiotics and other medications. Her condition is considered unstable, and she is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypernatremia put her at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and UTI increase her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ARF is a concern, and further deterioration could lead to end-stage renal disease.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's known DM2 and hyperglycemia put her at risk for further complications, such as ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperglycemic coma.
5. Wound infection: The patient's lower extremity dry gangrene is at risk for infection, which could lead to further complications.
6. Aspiration: The patient's frequent BIPAP and inability to eat put her at risk for aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia and other respiratory complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypernatremia and dehydration put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's myasthenia gravis and dementia put her at risk for further neurological complications, such as worsening muscle weakness and cognitive decline.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia, UTI, and ARF with antibiotics and other medications.
3. Monitor the patient's sodium levels closely and adjust her fluid therapy as needed to prevent further hypernatremia.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine levels closely and adjust her fluid therapy as needed to prevent further ARF.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin therapy as needed to prevent further hyperglycemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and provide wound care as needed to prevent infection.
7. Discuss the patient's aspiration risk with her family and consider feeding her with a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube if necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications as needed.
9. Consider consulting with a neurologist to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old lady with a complex medical history, including COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's condition has improved, with her respiratory status stabilizing, and her oxygen requirement decreasing. However, she still requires non-invasive ventilation and is at risk of aspiration due to her cognitive impairment and pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, bandemia, and elevated lactate levels, consistent with pneumonia. Blood cultures are pending, and she is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypocalcemia. Her creatinine level is 3.0 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction.

The patient's blood glucose levels are persistently in the mid-to-upper 200s, and she is receiving insulin sliding scale therapy. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry gangrene in her left lower extremity, which is likely related to her neuropathy and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and she is receiving ICU-level care. She needs to discuss her goals of care with her primary care physician and family.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory distress put her at risk of developing respiratory failure, which could require invasive mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and UTI increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing kidney disease and current renal dysfunction put her at risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Wound infection: The patient's dry gangrene in her left lower extremity is at risk of developing into a wound infection, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
5. Aspiration: The patient's cognitive impairment and pneumonia increase her risk of aspiration, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's persistently elevated blood glucose levels put her at risk of developing hyperglycemic complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia puts her at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and other complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old lady with COPD, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**], dementia presented with
   respiratory distress and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Most likely secondary to dehydration.  Pneumonia, UTI
   and hyperglycemia are contributing to this.  Need to correct it slowly
   , in first 24 hrs decreased from 170 to 158. Overnight the pace of
   correction has slowed, now plateaued in low 150s. Clinically much
   improved, less obtunded.  I/O positive 4800 yesterday.
   - continue D5
 NS at 150 ml/hour to complete 3 L this afternoon.
   Redraw NA and reaccess fluids with renal at that time
   - serum Na q4h
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Leukocytosis and bandemia.  Elevated lactate.  Aspiration
   vs. Nursing home acquired PNA. CXR consistant with aspiration PNA.
   Blood cultures pending. Respiratory status greatly improved, oxygen
   requirement decreased with vanco and zyosyn.
   - f/u blood cult
   - will continue vanc/zosyn
   -[**2-16**] renal failure ordering vanco doses 1 at a time, with trough after
   each dose.
   .
   # UTI: UA consistent with UTI.  However Urine culture with no growth so
   far
   - Abx as above.
   - f/u UCx
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline.  Baseline Cr  in 1s?  Most likely prerenal.
   UOP increasing and Cr steadally improving to 3.0
   - IVF as above
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # COPD:  History of COPD.  ? home oxygen. Was originally on solumedrol
   125 IV and titrated down yesterday.
   - d/c  solumedrol ( 40  IV daily) as COPD exacerbation unlikely, not
   wheezing.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Known DM2.  Most likely in the setting of stress
   (infection, respiratory distress) and steroids
   - ISS, increased ISS and added standing low dose glargine in setting of
   BG presistantly in mid to upper 200s.
   -Will need to trend sugars as steroids are stopped and depending on
   further dextrose in IVF.
   - If BG improved consider d/c glargine or decreased ISS to prevent
   hypoglycemia.
   .
   # lower extremity dry gangrene:  Patient has neuropathy and DM2.  Long
   term problem per family.
   - wound care
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now as high aspiration risk, replete lytes prn.
   Disucussed  with family option to feed with known aspiration risk vs no
   further nutrition. Family responable and had started hospice care
   discussion prior to this hospitalization. Would benefit from palliative
   care, SW after transferred out of ICU.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - f/u blood cult
   - will continue vanc/zosyn
   -[**2-16**] renal failure ordering vanco doses 1 at a time, with trough after
   each dose.
   .
   # UTI: UA consistent with UTI.  However Urine culture with no growth so
   far
   - Abx as above.
   - f/u UCx
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline.  Baseline Cr  in 1s?  Most likely prerenal.
   UOP increasing and Cr steadally improving to 3.0
   - IVF as above
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # COPD:  History of COPD.  ? home oxygen. Was originally on solumedrol
   125 IV and titrated down yesterday.
   - d/c  solumedrol ( 40  IV daily) as COPD exacerbation unlikely, not
   wheezing.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Known DM2.  Most likely in the setting of stress
   (infection, respiratory distress) and steroids
   - ISS, increased ISS and added standing low dose glargine in setting of
   BG presistantly in mid to upper 200s.
   -Will need to trend sugars as steroids are stopped and depending on
   further dextrose in IVF.
   - If BG improved consider d/c glargine or decreased ISS to prevent
   hypoglycemia.
   .
   # lower extremity dry gangrene:  Patient has neuropathy and DM2.  Long
   term problem per family.
   - wound care
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now as high aspiration risk, replete lytes prn.
   Disucussed  with family option to feed with known aspiration risk vs no
   further nutrition. Family responable and had started hospice care
   discussion prior to this hospitalization. Would benefit from palliative
   care, SW after transferred out of ICU.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old lady with COPD, myasthenia, dementia, and known DM2, who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypernatremia. She has a history of COPD exacerbation, UTI, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on 3L NC, and her respiratory rate is 20 inspirations per minute. She is alert and talking, but not oriented.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.8 K/uL
* Hct: 32.0%
* Plt: 276 K/uL
* Cr: 3.0 mg/dL
* Na: 152 mmol/L
* K: 3.8 mmol/L
* Ca++: 7.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypernatremia, likely secondary to dehydration, pneumonia, UTI, and hyperglycemia
* Pneumonia, with leukocytosis and bandemia, and elevated lactate
* UTI, with a UA consistent with UTI, but urine culture with no growth so far
* ARF, with unclear baseline, but most likely prerenal
* COPD, with a history of exacerbation
* Hyperglycemia, likely due to stress and steroids
* Lower extremity dry gangrene, likely due to neuropathy and DM2
* FEN, with a high aspiration risk

The patient's medications include:

* Methylprednisolone at 40 IV daily
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 06:00 PM
* Vancomycin at 08:00 PM
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) at 02:00 AM
* Ipratropium, Albuterol, and ISS

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing D5 NS at 150 ml/hour to complete 3 L this afternoon
* Redrawing Na and reaccessing fluids with renal at that time
* Monitoring UOP and Cr levels
* Continuing vanco and zyosyn for pneumonia
* Ordering vanco doses 1 at a time, with trough after each dose
* Monitoring BG levels and adjusting ISS and glargine as needed
* Wound care for lower extremity dry gangrene
* NPO for now, with replete lytes prn, and discussion with family about feeding and hospice care
* Sc heparin for prophylaxis
* DNR/DNI code status, confirmed with son, HCP, and nursing home

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory status
* Development of septic shock
* Progression of ARF
* Worsening of hyperglycemia
* Aspiration pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ failure

The patient's family is planning to move towards hospice care, and the patient's code status is DNR/DNI."
