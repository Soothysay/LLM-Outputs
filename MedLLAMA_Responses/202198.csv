You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hep C, autoimmune hepatitis, and HIV. She was previously hospitalized for liver issues and was ready to be discharged from rehab when she developed poor mental status, lethargy, and respiratory distress. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of staph bacteremia, likely due to an unknown source. She has a new murmur, which may indicate endocarditis. Her ARF has improved with IV hydration, and she has been restarted on HAART. Her ESLD is being managed with lactulose, and she is being considered for a liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's poor mental status and high WBC count suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and new murmur suggest the possibility of an infection, which could be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's new murmur and positive blood culture for staph may indicate endocarditis, which can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.
4. ARF: The patient's ARF has improved with IV hydration, but it is essential to continue monitoring her renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
5. ESLD: The patient's ESLD is being managed with lactulose, but it is essential to continue monitoring her liver function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Liver transplant: The patient's ESLD and HIV status may make her a candidate for a liver transplant, which would require careful consideration and evaluation.
7. HIV: The patient's HIV status requires ongoing management with HAART, and it is essential to monitor her viral load and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress requires ongoing monitoring and management, and it is essential to ensure that her oxygenation and ventilation are adequate."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including HIV, autoimmune hepatitis, and hepatitis C. She was previously admitted to the hospital for liver issues and was ready to be discharged from rehab when she became lethargic and developed respiratory symptoms, including right lower lobe atelectasis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with poor mental status, suspected infection, and sepsis. Her vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/38 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has a new murmur, which may indicate endocarditis.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and acyclovir, but the cultures have been positive for Staphylococcus aureus, which may indicate bacteremia. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels, which may indicate liver damage.

The patient's kidney function is also compromised, with an estimated creatinine clearance of 18.1 mL/min, which may indicate acute kidney injury. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. Her chest x-ray shows right lower lobe atelectasis, which may indicate pneumonia.

The patient's neurological status is also abnormal, with poor mental status, suspected hepatic encephalopathy, and asterixis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and suspected infection can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ failure and death.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's new murmur may indicate endocarditis, which can lead to heart failure and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's compromised kidney function can lead to acute kidney injury, which can require dialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver damage can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, coma, and death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise can lead to respiratory failure, which can require mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's unstable blood pressure and heart rate can lead to cardiovascular collapse, which can cause death.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires immediate attention to address her multiple organ dysfunction and potential complications."

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,

   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The

   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally

   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with a change in mental status likely caused by hepatic encephalopathy, possibly secondary to infection.

The patient has Staph aureus bacteremia and endocarditis on the mitral valve, with a small vegetation noted on the posterior leaflet. She has been treated with vancomycin and will require 6 weeks of antibiotics.

The patient has also been diagnosed with recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and has been started on lactulose therapy. Her CD4 count is 16, and her viral load is low.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 78 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 7 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 18.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 80 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L

The patient's urine culture shows Staph aureus coag +, with 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Systemic emboli: Given the patient's endocarditis, there is a risk of systemic emboli, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiac effects: The patient's endocarditis and mitral regurgitation may lead to cardiac effects, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac tamponade.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's recurrent hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further cognitive impairment and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and endocarditis increase her risk of developing secondary infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis or transplantation.
6. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may lead to complications such as opportunistic infections, cancers, and neurocognitive disorders.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care should include:

1. Continued antibiotics for Staph aureus bacteremia and endocarditis.
2. Monitoring for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects.
3. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Regular laboratory testing to monitor for kidney and liver dysfunction.
5. Consultation with infectious disease, cardiology, and hepatology specialists.
6. Consideration of HIV-related complications and treatment as necessary."

   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with a change in mental status (MS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, possibly secondary to infection or infection itself, particularly central nervous system (CNS) infection.

The patient has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) bacteremia and endocarditis on the mitral valve. The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
	* Follow-up sensitivities of blood cultures.
	* Vancomycin for 6 weeks.
	* Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects, including heart failure.
2. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with Staph.
	* Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
	* Vancomycin for now.
	* Thiamine for possible Wernicke's encephalopathy.
3. Hypotension:
	* Patient's baseline blood pressures were 100s/50s at the nursing home. Now meets SIRS criteria with WBCs and tachycardia.
	* Not initially responsive to fluids.
	* IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up.
	* Albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure.
	* DNR/DNI status.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF):
	* Better with IV hydration, likely pre-renal.
	* UOP 30mL/hour.
	* Urine lytes/osm consistent with mixed picture, but patient was taking lasix before admission.
	* Will check urine urea.
	* Continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
5. HIV:
	* Increased HAART meds recently.
	* CD4 16, VL low.
	* Atoviquone PPx for PCP.
6. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease):
	* MELD score is 28.
	* Hepatology consulting re transplant.
	* Lactulose.
	* Holding lasix and aldactone for now due to hypotension.
7. HCV:
	* Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of her deterioration in MS.
	* Transplant will see her.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Fever
* Tachycardia
* Hypotension
* Increased WBCs
* Elevated lactate levels
* Decreased urine output
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)
* Abnormal renal function tests (RFTs)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac complications due to Staph endocarditis, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic emboli.
2. Neurological complications due to hepatic encephalopathy, such as seizures, coma, and death.
3. Renal complications due to ARF, such as acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection-related complications, such as sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
5. HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and HIV-related encephalopathy.
6. ESLD-related complications, such as ascites, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for Staph endocarditis and bacteremia.
2. Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Vancomycin for now.
4. Thiamine for possible Wernicke's encephalopathy.
5. IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up.
6. Albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure.
7. DNR/DNI status.
8. Monitoring for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects.
9. Checking urine urea and following UOP.
10. Transplant evaluation for ESLD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy and/or infection with Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Empiric vanc for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP 30mL/hour
   - Will check urine lytes/osm
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - Will hold HAART in setting of sepsis
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU with a change in mental status (MS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may be secondary to infection or infection itself, particularly CNS infection given her high-risk status with HIV.

The patient's current conditions include:

* Sepsis with Staph aureus bacteremia
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Hypotension (BP 110/58 mmHg)
* Acute kidney injury (ARF) likely pre-renal
* Respiratory support with oxygen therapy
* Abdominal US showing ascites and no evidence of stenosis, thrombosis, or occlusion
* TIPS patency documented

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration in mental status
* Development of septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Progression of ARF to acute tubular necrosis
* Increased risk of infection due to immunocompromised state
* Development of hepatic failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to liver disease and anticoagulation therapy

The patient is currently receiving empiric vancomycin for Staph aureus bacteremia, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, thiamine for potential Wernicke's encephalopathy, and IV fluids for hypotension. The patient is also being considered for liver transplant due to her high MELD score and history of ESLD.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications and improve her overall outcome."

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis

   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure

    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now

   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU with a change in mental status (MS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself.

The patient has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis on the mitral valve. She has a small amount of ascites present and is receiving vancomycin for antibiotic coverage.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 7 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a small amount of edema in her upper and lower extremities, as well as a 2+ reflex in her biceps. Her right shoulder is painful and unable to be abducted past 90 degrees due to a possible rotator cuff injury. Her neurologic examination is normal, with no evidence of focal deficits or seizures.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 69 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 32 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 65 IU/L. Her HIV viral load is 679 copies/mL, and her CD4 count is 16%.

The patient's imaging studies show a small vegetation on the mitral valve, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Her echocardiogram also shows a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and a normal pulmonary artery pressure.

The patient's clinical course has been complicated by hypotension, which has responded to fluid boluses and vasopressors. She has also developed acute kidney injury (AKI), which is likely pre-renal in origin. Her urine output has improved with IV hydration, and her electrolyte levels are being closely monitored.

The patient's care plan includes continued antibiotic therapy for her bacteremia and endocarditis, as well as management of her hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose. She is also receiving antiretroviral therapy for her HIV infection, and her CD4 count and viral load are being monitored regularly.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is receiving palliative care. Her disposition is currently unknown, pending further evaluation and treatment."

   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Provisional Findings Impression: BMzb MON [**2107-9-19**] 8:00 PM
   PFI: TIPS patency is documented. There is no evidence of stenosis,
   thrombosis or occlusion. A small amount of ascites is present.
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   -          ID consult for antibiotic recs ?adding second [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   complicated endocarditis.
   #. UTI: Patient with Staph in urine.
   -          F/u urine culture final read
   -          On vancomycin
   #. Right  shoulder pain: concern for septic arthritis vs trauma while
   altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 621**].
   -          Ortho consult
   -          XR of shoulder
   -          Tap if necessary to r/o septic arthritis.
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Met  SIRS
   criteria on admission with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially
   responsive to fluids but now BP at baseline.
   - will give IVF boluses with albumin as needed to keep pressures up
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP (normally on dapsone but changed [**2-26**] renal
   failure)
   -Will follow ID recs re:HAART and prophylaxis as patient technically
   now also qualifies for toxo and MAC prophylaxis.
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
 will f/u recs
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Provisional Findings Impression: BMzb MON [**2107-9-19**] 8:00 PM
   PFI: TIPS patency is documented. There is no evidence of stenosis,
   thrombosis or occlusion. A small amount of ascites is present.
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   -          ID consult for antibiotic recs ?adding second [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   complicated endocarditis.
   #. UTI: Patient with Staph in urine.
   -          F/u urine culture final read
   -          On vancomycin
   #. Right  shoulder pain: concern for septic arthritis vs trauma while
   altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 621**].
   -          Ortho consult
   -          XR of shoulder
   -          Tap if necessary to r/o septic arthritis.
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Met  SIRS
   criteria on admission with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially
   responsive to fluids but now BP at baseline.
   - will give IVF boluses with albumin as needed to keep pressures up
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP (normally on dapsone but changed [**2-26**] renal
   failure)
   -Will follow ID recs re:HAART and prophylaxis as patient technically
   now also qualifies for toxo and MAC prophylaxis.
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
 will f/u recs
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU with a change in mental status (MS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Staph aureus bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Staph aureus. She is currently receiving vancomycin for antibiotic coverage.
2. Staph endocarditis: The patient has a small vegetation on the mitral valve, which is likely due to Staph aureus bacteremia. She requires 6 weeks of vancomycin therapy and serial anaerobic cultures to monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects.
3. Right shoulder pain: The patient has a concern for septic arthritis or trauma while altered MS. She requires an orthopedic consult and an X-ray of the shoulder to rule out septic arthritis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a MELD score of 28, which indicates a high risk of mortality. She requires lactulose therapy and holding of lasix and aldactone for now due to hypotension.
5. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) that is likely pre-renal. She requires IV hydration and monitoring of urine output to assess perfusion.
6. HIV: The patient has a low CD4 count and a low viral load. She is taking atoviquone prophylaxis for PCP and will require ID consultation for HAART and prophylaxis recommendations.
7. ESLD: The patient has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and requires a transplant evaluation. She will be followed up with hepatitis consulting and ID recs.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm
* Blood pressure: 110/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 7 breaths/min
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right eye conjunctive injection
* Edema of upper and lower extremities
* 2+ biceps reflexes
* Symmetric and normal left and right leg strength
* Unable to passively abduct shoulder past 90 degrees on the right side

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 18.6 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 29.4%
* Plt: 80 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 213 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* TTE: Mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are seen.
* RUQ U/S: TIPS patency is documented, and a small amount of ascites is present.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Staph endocarditis: Vancomycin therapy for 6 weeks, serial anaerobic cultures, and monitoring for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects.
* UTI: Vancomycin therapy and monitoring for signs of UTI.
* Right shoulder pain: Orthopedic consult and X-ray of the shoulder to rule out septic arthritis.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: Lactulose therapy and holding of lasix and aldactone for now due to hypotension.
* ARF: IV hydration and monitoring of urine output to assess perfusion.
* HIV: ID consultation for HAART and prophylaxis recommendations.
* ESLD: Hepatology consulting and ID recs for transplant evaluation.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending consults and ID recs today, with a possible transfer to the floor tomorrow if stable overnight."

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old individual with HIV and cirrhosis, currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing a decline in their condition, with the development of MRSA sepsis, MV endocarditis, and right shoulder pain. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin for MRSA sepsis and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of MRSA sepsis and MV endocarditis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure, respiratory distress, and even death if not properly managed.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has MV endocarditis, which can lead to complications such as heart failure, embolism, and even death if not properly managed.
3. Right Shoulder Pain: The patient is experiencing right shoulder pain, which may be due to a septic joint or hardware failure. If left untreated, this can lead to further complications such as sepsis, abscess formation, and even death.
4. HIV: The patient has HIV and is being treated with HAART and atovaquone. However, if not properly managed, HIV can lead to complications such as opportunistic infections, immune suppression, and even death.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and liver failure if not properly managed.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient has been tested for Hepatitis C and has a negative result. However, if left untreated, Hepatitis C can lead to complications such as liver failure, cirrhosis, and even death.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their condition closely and providing appropriate medical treatment to prevent further complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old with HIV and cirrhosis, currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone a trans-thoracic echo that revealed MV vegetation and 2+ MR. An ultrasound of the abdomen and head CT were unremarkable. The patient is more awake, thirsty, and hungry, denying pain. The patient has a history of nicotine allergy, coma, and cytopenia. The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, fentanyl, protonix, lactulose, truvada, and morphine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 96% and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's neurologic status is also stable, with the patient able to follow simple commands and respond to stimuli.

The patient's lab results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with a count of 18.6 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT level of 32 IU/L and an AST level of 60 IU/L. The patient's HIV viral load is 679 copies/mL.

The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA sepsis and MV endocarditis, and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient has also been diagnosed with a possible septic joint in the right shoulder, and will be undergoing an MRI and orthopedic consultation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's diagnosis of MRSA sepsis and MV endocarditis increases the risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's diagnosis of MV endocarditis increases the risk of developing complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolization.
3. Septic arthritis: The patient's diagnosis of a possible septic joint in the right shoulder increases the risk of developing complications such as joint instability, bone destruction, and systemic infection.
4. HIV-related complications: The patient's diagnosis of HIV increases the risk of developing opportunistic infections and cancers, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
5. Liver failure: The patient's diagnosis of cirrhosis increases the risk of developing liver failure, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased mortality.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's diagnosis of MRSA sepsis and MV endocarditis increases the risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's diagnosis of MV endocarditis increases the risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolization."
