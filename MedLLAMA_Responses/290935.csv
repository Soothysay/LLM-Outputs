   EGD [**1-7**];
   Clotted blood was seen in the colon. The distal polypectomy site could
   not be located due to clot and stool, however there appeared to be less
   blood more proximal to the decending colon suggesting that this is the
   bleeding source. No active bleeding was seen.
   Recommendations: serial hematocrits; golytely prep for colonoscopy now.
   If pt rebleeds, colonoscopy once prep is complete. If no rebleeding
   will follow conservatively
   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED,
   GIB)
   77M s/p colonoscopy a day ago who presents with BRBPR without changes
   in hemodynamics or HCT. At that procedure he underwent 7 polypectomies
   and was noted to have mild hemorrhoids. He has a history of easy
   bleeding, per the patient. He was admitted to the ICU for colonoscopy,
   but is refusing bowel prep for now and wants to see if his bleeding
   will stop spontaneously.
   .
   # LGIB: Likely due to recent polypectomies. S/P flex sig on [**1-7**],
   transfused multiple units and Hct relatively stable but after bump it
   seems to drift back down post-transfusion. Prepped with go-lytely o/n.
   Hct dropped again post-transfusion this AM.
   - colonoscopy later this morning
   - transfuse 3 units pRBC now
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - check 5pm CBC, coags, calcium
   - add-on albumin to AM labs to correct Ca; give 4g IV calcium gluconate
   now
   - f/u GI recs and post-colonoscopy recs
   - Access with an 18g and 16g and 20g PIVs
   - Type and screen up to date
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt anxious on admission with SBP>170. Likely
   combination of stress plus chronic hypertension. Improved (albeit with
   concern could be BP heading in hypotensive direction sign).
   - Holding aggressive BP control in the context of bleeding
   - Will use hydralazine for SBP>170 with goal to maintain pressure
   around 140
   - Trend for now and treat as appropriate
   - Hold home lisinopril
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved. Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia from bowel
   prep; s/p NS infusion
   .
   # Depression and anxiety: Continue home Prozac 20mg PO daily
   .
   # BPH: Continue home finasteride 5mg PO daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent colonoscopy a day ago and presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). He had undergone 7 polypectomies and was noted to have mild hemorrhoids. He has a history of easy bleeding and was admitted to the ICU for colonoscopy. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic status: The patient is hemodynamically stable, with a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 132/54 mmHg, and SpO2 of 94%.
* Respiratory status: The patient is receiving no oxygen therapy and has a respiratory rate of 14 inspirations per minute.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient is experiencing ongoing melena and has had multiple units of blood transfused. His hemoglobin level has dropped again post-transfusion this morning.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 31.0 g/dL, and platelet count is 298 K/uL.
* Imaging studies: An abdominal X-ray showed stool filling of the ascending colon and air filling of multiple non-distended or slightly distended small bowel loops.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped again post-transfusion, and he may require further transfusions.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's blood loss may lead to hypovolemic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Infection: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may increase his risk of infection, particularly if he has a compromised immune system.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's multiple blood transfusions may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and calcium.
5. Renal failure: The patient's hypovolemic shock may lead to renal failure if not treated promptly.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to respiratory failure if it is not controlled.
7. Sepsis: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to sepsis if it is not treated promptly.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and bleeding.
2. Administer further blood transfusions as necessary to maintain the patient's hemoglobin level.
3. Consider administering IV fluids and electrolytes to correct any electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider administering diuretics if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider administering oxygen therapy if necessary.
6. Consider administering antibiotics if the patient develops signs of infection.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider administering sedatives if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a colonoscopy a day ago and presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). He has a history of easy bleeding and has undergone 7 polypectomies during the procedure. The patient is currently in the ICU due to ongoing bleeding and is refusing bowel prep for now.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the low 100s, blood pressure in the 140s, and good oxygen saturation on room air. His hematocrit (Hct) has dropped significantly, and he has received multiple units of blood transfusions. However, his Hct has remained relatively stable but has drifted back down post-transfusion.

The patient's physical examination is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of melena and tachycardia with standing. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his lungs are clear.

Laboratory results show a low platelet count (298,000/mL), an elevated white blood cell count (11.3 K/uL), and an abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR: 14.0/34.8/1.2). His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level (5.7 mEq/L).

Radiological studies show stool filling of the ascending colon and air filling of multiple non-distended or slightly distended small bowel loops, with sparse small air-fluid levels. No evidence of free air or pathological calcifications was seen.

The patient's bleeding is likely due to recent polypectomies, and he is at risk for ongoing bleeding and hypovolemic shock. The patient's hypertension is likely due to stress and chronic hypertension, and his hyponatremia has resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ongoing bleeding and hypovolemic shock
2. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding diathesis
3. Infection and sepsis
4. Hypovolemic hyponatremia
5. Chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease
6. Depression and anxiety

The patient's plan of care includes serial hematocrits, golytely prep for colonoscopy, and conservative management of bleeding. The patient will also receive IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed. The patient's family will be educated on the patient's condition and treatment plan."
