   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, a fib on coumadin found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Sepsis: Bandemia.  Likely from pneumonia given large inflitrate on
   CXR.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated
   hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess or perforation.
   Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  On levophed and neo.  Blood cultures
   positive for GNR.
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl
   - pressors to keep MAP > 65
   - Continue IVF bolus as tolerated
   #. Respiratory Failure: Sedation and ventilation.  Underlying etiology
   likely pna vs aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Vent settings as tolerated
   #. A fib with RVR: On arriveal rate in 120s and ST depressions.  On
   Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.  Likely also tachycardic [**2-28**] sepsis.  Give
   Metoprolol 5mg IV, repeated for decreased HR, with drop in BP.
   - treat underlying sepsis with IVF and pressors
   - If returns to RVR will schedule metoprolol 10mg IV q6h
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Elevated troponin: Trop 0.09 and stable.  CK-MB normal.  Unknown if
   symptommatic.  EKG with ST depressions in V5-V6.  Likely demand
   ischemia in setting of sepsis and a fib with RVR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (a fib), and a recent episode of sepsis. He was found down and was started on antibiotics, pressors, and sedation. His vital signs are stable, but he has ongoing respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (AKI). He has a history of CHF and severe aortic stenosis (AS), but has refused surgery in the past. He is currently on IV fluids, pressors, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Gram-negative rods (GNR), which may indicate a severe infection. He is at risk for further complications, such as organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. He is at risk for further respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheostomy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage. He may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) or dialysis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF and AS makes him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other factors. He is at risk for further neurological decline, including stroke, seizures, and coma.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of CHF and AS makes him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures indicate a severe infection, and he is at risk for further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
8. Bleeding: The patient's history of CHF and AS makes him at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and ecchymoses.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, and a recent incarceration of a hernia without repair. He was found down and has been intubated and sedated. He has developed sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, and is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation. He has also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with metoprolol. His troponin levels are elevated, but it is unclear if it is symptomatic. He has acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are trending down. He has altered mental status, which is likely due to sepsis, and is being treated with sedation. He has C-spine precautions due to unknown trauma, and his code status is full.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue to worsen without proper treatment, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen without proper treatment, leading to respiratory arrest and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is likely to continue to worsen without proper treatment, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely to worsen without proper treatment, leading to kidney failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely to worsen without proper treatment, leading to confusion, disorientation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. C-Spine Precautions: The patient's C-spine precautions are necessary to prevent further injury, but they also increase the risk of respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac ischemia, which is a potentially life-threatening complication that requires immediate attention.
8. Infection: The patient's sepsis is likely to be caused by an infection, which requires proper treatment to prevent further complications.
9. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely to cause organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure, which requires immediate attention to prevent further complications.
10. Mortality: The patient's condition is critical, and mortality is a significant risk without proper treatment."

   Imaging: [**11-30**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**11-29**], there is
   little overall change in the diffuse opacification involving much of
   the left lung and consistent with widespread pneumonia. The possibility

.  On a prior admission, Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical intervention
   and not wanting escalation of care.  He did not formally make himself
   DNR/DNI.  Will meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
 HCP here in early afternoon.  He agrees to patient being DNR and not
   escalating care.  However, he would like to maintain current level of
   care until he can contact some of the patient
s [**Known lastname 2094**].  [**Name (NI) **] agreed to
   being called tomorrow for further update.
   #.  Sepsis: Has progression on CXR and is still requiring extensive
   pressor support.  Source likely his pneumonia given GNR in sputum and
   blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive GNR.  Urine without evidence of
   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl, now
   on Vanc/cefepime/cipro/Flagyl.  Given the culture data of pan-sensitive
   E.Coli and GPC on sputum, we will simplify to vanc/cipro.  Given that
   his HCP does not want to escalate care, we will give no further fluid
   boluses and wean the pressors as tolerated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He was found down and intubated in the emergency department. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and incarcerated hernia. He has been diagnosed with small bowel obstruction, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. His vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 102.6°F, tachycardia, and hypertension. He has decreased lung sounds and is on a high FiO2. His blood cultures are pending, but preliminary sensitivities show pan-sensitive E. coli.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia is likely to worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to progress, leading to multi-organ failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic renal failure.
4. Cardiac failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to coma or brain death.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's small bowel obstruction may worsen, leading to bowel perforation or necrosis.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to his immobility and sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's goals of care are to maintain his current level of care until his HCP can be contacted. The patient has been declared DNR and is not to be escalated to higher levels of care. The patient will continue to receive antibiotics, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation. His blood cultures will be followed, and his antibiotics will be adjusted accordingly. His fluid status will be closely monitored, and his pressors will be weaned as tolerated. His mental status will be monitored, and his sedation will be weaned and repeated as necessary."

   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend will be here
   today.  The patient consented to intubation in the ED and the HCP has
   wanted to treat
reversible processes
.  On a prior admission, Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical intervention
   and not wanting escalation of care.  He did not formally make himself
   DNR/DNI.  Will meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
 HCP here in early afternoon.  He agrees to patient being DNR and not
   escalating care.  However, he would like to maintain current level of
   care until he can contact some of the patient
s cousins.  [**Name (NI) **] agreed to
   being called tomorrow for further update.
   #.  Sepsis: Has progression on CXR and is still requiring extensive
   pressor support.  Source likely his pneumonia given GNR in sputum and
   blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive GNR.  Urine without evidence of
   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl, now
   on Vanc/cefepime/cipro/Flagyl.  Given the culture data of pan-sensitive
   E.Coli and GPC on sputum, we will simplify to vanc/cipro.  Given that
   his HCP does not want to escalate care, we will give no further fluid
   boluses and wean the pressors as tolerated.
   - f/u more recent blood cultures.
   - Abx: vanc/cipro
   - pressors to keep MAP > 65, weaning Levophed as much as tolerated.
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 2.0 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Monitor UOP.  If it drops off acutely, we may consider giving further
   boluses of fluid.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. Elevated troponin: Trop 0.09, last measured on [**11-23**] was 0.02.
   CK-MB normal.  Unknown if symptommatic.  Has not progressed further and
   we are not treating at this time.
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.
   - Clear when mental status improves
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl, now
   on Vanc/cefepime/cipro/Flagyl.  Given the culture data of pan-sensitive
   E.Coli and GPC on sputum, we will simplify to vanc/cipro.  Given that
   his HCP does not want to escalate care, we will give no further fluid
   boluses and wean the pressors as tolerated.
   - f/u more recent blood cultures.
   - Abx: vanc/cipro
   - pressors to keep MAP > 65, weaning Levophed as much as tolerated.
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.

   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 2.0 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Monitor UOP.  If it drops off acutely, we may consider giving further
   boluses of fluid.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. Elevated troponin: Trop 0.09, last measured on [**11-23**] was 0.02.
   CK-MB normal.  Unknown if symptommatic.  Has not progressed further and

   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia. He was found down and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.6°F (39.2°C)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm
* Blood pressure: 113/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97% on 70% FiO2

The patient has a variety of laboratory results, including:

* White blood cell count: 6.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 128 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.09 ng/mL

The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, sepsis, acute renal failure, and chronic heart failure. He is receiving treatment with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, as well as pressor support with phenylephrine and norepinephrine.

The patient's mental status is altered, and he is unable to follow commands. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin, but his international normalized ratio (INR) is currently low. He has a history of chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis.

The patient has a small bowel obstruction and a history of incarcerated hernia. He has refused surgery in the past and has not had any recent surgical interventions.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and his healthcare proxy has been notified. The patient's disposition is pending a plan from his healthcare proxy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Small bowel obstruction
* Hernia repair
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Stroke
* Ischemic heart disease

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient's treatment plan should be individualized to address his specific needs and goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is progressing, and the source is likely the pneumonia given the GNR in the sputum and blood. The patient is still requiring extensive pressor support, and the focus will be on meeting with his HCP to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely to require a tracheostomy due to the progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's heart rate is in the 120s, and ST depressions are present. The patient is being held off on nodal blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for sepsis.
4. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, and the cause is unknown. The patient may be experiencing demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
5. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a previous incisional hernia that is now reduced, but a new inguinal hernia has developed. The patient's CT scan shows evidence of SBO, and surgery is aware.
6. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is stabilized at 2.0, and the urine output is approximately 40cc per hour. The patient's kidney function may be compromised due to sepsis and hypotension.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and it is unclear whether this is due to trauma, sepsis, or other factors. The patient is on sedation and is difficult to assess.
8. C-Spine Precautions: The patient was found down and is unable to clear altered mental status. The patient's C-spine is negative on CT scan.
9. CHF/AS: The patient has chronic heart failure and severe aortic stenosis. The patient has refused surgery in the past, and the patient's fluid status will need to be closely monitored.
10. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for developing DVT, and prophylaxis measures will need to be implemented.

The patient's code status is confirmed as full, and the emergency contact is listed as [**Name (NI) 5463**] [**Name (NI) 10741**]. The patient's disposition is listed as ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.  Unable to clear collar
   given AMS.
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.  Unable to clear collar
   given AMS.
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia. He was found down and has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is poor, and his HCP and family have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen due to the continued presence of E. Coli in his blood and pneumonia. Antibiotics have been changed to vanc/cipro, but further blood cultures are needed to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to the progressive pneumonia. He requires increased FiO2 and is at risk of further decompensation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to worsen due to the increased heart rate and ST depressions. Holding off on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for sepsis may exacerbate this condition.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine has stabilized at 1.9, but his UOP is down to 30cc/hour, indicating poor coping with sepsis. He is at risk of further deterioration in renal function.
5. SBO: The patient has a new inguinal hernia and a SBO, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sepsis-related toxic/metabolic abnormalities. Weaning sedation and monitoring for changes is necessary.
7. C-spine precautions: The patient's C-spine is at risk due to unknown trauma and altered mental status.
8. CHF/AS: The patient's chronic heart failure and severe aortic stenosis may worsen due to the sepsis and pneumonia.
9. FEN: The patient's nutritional status is at risk due to NPO status and repletion of electrolytes.

Given the patient's poor prognosis and DNR status, it is essential to focus on symptom management and palliative care. The patient's HCP and family should be involved in decision-making regarding further care, and the patient's goals of care should be respected."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.  Unable to clear collar
   given AMS.
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   #. FEN: NPO, repleate lytes
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Pantoprazole 40mg Q24hrs for stress-ulcer prophylaxis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia. He was found down and is currently in the ICU with sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. His condition is deteriorating, and his HCP has agreed to make him DNR and not escalate his care further. The patient's family has been informed and has agreed with the decision.

The patient's labs show:

* WBC: 11.1, 8.2, 6.5
* Hct: 36.0, 35.1, 34.8
* Plt: 147, 128, 105
* Cr: 2.2, 2.0, 2.0, 1.9
* TCO2: 19, 23, 23, 21
* Glucose: 123, 164, 152, 115

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 39.2 C (102.6 F)
* HR: 103 bpm (90-115)
* BP: 95/43 mmHg (60/40-124/51)
* RR: 20 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to his pneumonia, and his condition is deteriorating. He is at risk for further complications, such as organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his progressive pneumonia, and he is at risk for further deterioration and death.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely due to his sepsis, and he is at risk for further deterioration and end-stage renal disease.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to his sepsis, and he is at risk for further deterioration and death.
5. C-Spine Precautions: The patient's C-spine precautions are necessary due to his unknown trauma, and he is at risk for further complications, such as spinal cord injury.
6. CHF/AS: The patient's CHF and severe AS are likely exacerbating his condition, and he is at risk for further deterioration and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vanc/cipro antibiotics for sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely for signs of further deterioration.
3. Consider weaning sedation and monitoring for changes in the patient's mental status.
4. Continue C-spine precautions and monitor for signs of spinal cord injury.
5. Hold home lisinopril and consider alternative medications for hypertension.
6. Repleate electrolytes and monitor for signs of dehydration.
7. Continue stress-ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole.
8. Monitor for signs of DVT and VAP and take prophylactic measures as necessary."
