   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue diuresis on lasix drip with goal -1 to 2L daily as she
   is still likely total body volume overloaded. She is currently
   responding well to her lasix drip. Will hold off on adding
   thiazide-type diuretic at this point. Will tolerate rise in creatinine
   at this point as volume seems to be her primary problem. Renal
   consulted in CCU, recommendations appreciated regarding
   ?ultrafiltration
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Per discussion with transferring team, patient had agreed to
   limited trial of intubation if necessary. Intubation may be technically
   difficult per anesthesiology.
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will attempt sputum gram stain and culture if she
   can expectorate any sputum, check legionella urinary antigen though
   probably low yield at this point.
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Given coagulopathy will hold off on thoracentesis for now
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above. Although her EF was measured
   within the normal range, she does have at least moderate MR on her
   echocardiogram which would decrease her effective forward output.
   Optimizing rate control of her atrial fibrillation may also be helpful
   allowing for increased filling time. Cardiology recommendations
   appreciated.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem; oral agents held in
   setting of BiPAP. Will resume oral diltiazem and follow closely - her
   absoption of PO meds may be decreased secondary to gut edema. Hold
   anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR today.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
 COAGULOPATHY
   Possible secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic decrease in vitamin K
   levels. No evidence for DIC on labs. Repleted with vitamin K today.
   Will trend INR daily, resume warfarin for INR<2.5.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Continue home Pentasa for Crohns
   h/o thyroid CA s/p cyberknife
   TSH recently checked [**12-12**] and suppressed at 0.07. might have
   thyroiditis post radiation which could potentially exacerbate her
   atrial fibrillation. repeat tsh and free T4.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Given coagulopathy will hold off on thoracentesis for now
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above. Although her EF was measured
   within the normal range, she does have at least moderate MR on her
   echocardiogram which would decrease her effective forward output.
   Optimizing rate control of her atrial fibrillation may also be helpful
   allowing for increased filling time. Cardiology recommendations
   appreciated.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem; oral agents held in
   setting of BiPAP. Will resume oral diltiazem and follow closely - her
   absoption of PO meds may be decreased secondary to gut edema. Hold
   anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR today.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
 COAGULOPATHY
   Possible secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic decrease in vitamin K
   levels. No evidence for DIC on labs. Repleted with vitamin K today.
   Will trend INR daily, resume warfarin for INR<2.5.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of thyroid cancer, Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute heart failure, and coagulopathy. She has been experiencing fever, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, and has a suppressed TSH level. She has been treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants, and has undergone various diagnostic tests, including echocardiogram, CT scan, and blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and poor rate control. Pneumonia, aspiration, and pulmonary hypertension are also possible causes.
2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient's acute heart failure is likely due to diastolic dysfunction, with moderate mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation contributing to decreased effective forward output.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic-induced decrease in vitamin K levels. DIC is unlikely based on lab results.
4. Fever: The patient's fever may be secondary to pneumonia, UTI, or C. difficile colitis, and should be monitored closely.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state, and should be monitored closely.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's type II diabetes should be managed with insulin sliding scale and fingerstick glucose monitoring.
7. Thyroid Cancer: The patient's thyroid cancer is likely to be managed with radiation therapy, and her TSH level should be monitored closely.
8. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer should be managed with pressure ulcer prevention and treatment.
9. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion should be managed with behavioral interventions and medication as needed.
10. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional deficiencies should be monitored and managed with supplements as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue lasix boluses to attempt to diuresis 100 cc/hr if BP
   will tolerate
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Currently comfortable and satting well on NC, and allows
   patient to get more rest as she is uncomfortable on BiPAP
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will follow cutures
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above.
   -f/u on Cardiology recs
   -Repeat ECHO to eval MR, and what appears to be worsening cardiac
   failure despite aggressive in house diuresis from admission
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem, but appears to break
   through, will start on Diltiazem drip
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
   -          continue abx as above
 COAGULOPATHY
   -Markedly improved with small vitamin K dosing
   -will not restart coumadin at this time, but will place patient on SQ
   heparin
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH, repeat TSH low, but FT4 normal, will not take further
   action at this time
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue lasix boluses to attempt to diuresis 100 cc/hr if BP
   will tolerate
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Currently comfortable and satting well on NC, and allows
   patient to get more rest as she is uncomfortable on BiPAP
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will follow cutures
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above.
   -f/u on Cardiology recs
   -Repeat ECHO to eval MR, and what appears to be worsening cardiac
   failure despite aggressive in house diuresis from admission
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem, but appears to break
   through, will start on Diltiazem drip
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
   -          continue abx as above
 COAGULOPATHY
   -Markedly improved with small vitamin K dosing
   -will not restart coumadin at this time, but will place patient on SQ
   heparin
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH, repeat TSH low, but FT4 normal, will not take further
   action at this time
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible coagulopathy. She has a history of diabetes, thyroid cancer, Crohn's disease, and decubitus ulcer. She was previously on antibiotics, lasix, and diltiazem. She has had difficulty with arterial line placement and has been experiencing respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, with contributions from pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and poor rate control. The patient's lung mets may also be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension.
2. Heart failure: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure on chronic heart failure. The plan is to continue diuresis and monitoring.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has improved with small vitamin K dosing, but she may need further treatment.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to diuresis leading to a pre-renal state. The plan is to continue diuresis and monitor urine lytes.
5. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and may have a pneumonia or UTI. Cultures and stool C. difficile toxin should be checked.
6. Diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes and is being covered with insulin sliding scale.
7. Thyroid cancer: The patient has suppressed TSH and normal FT4, but no further action is planned at this time.
8. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer present at admission.
9. Delirium/confusion: The patient is at risk for delirium and confusion due to electrolyte imbalance and medication.
10. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to poor rate control and potential lung mets.

Plan:

* Continue lasix boluses to attempt diuresis
* Reattempt BiPAP if respiratory distress worsens
* Continue vancomycin and zosyn for now, pending culture results
* Monitor I/O, daily weight, and electrolytes
* Aspiration precautions
* Follow-up on Cardiology recommendations
* Repeat ECHO to evaluate MR and cardiac failure
* Start Diltiazem drip for atrial fibrillation
* Check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C. difficile toxin
* Continue antibiotics as above
* Place patient on SQ heparin for coagulopathy
* Cover with insulin sliding scale for diabetes
* Repeat TSH and FT4 for thyroid cancer
* Continue home Pentasa for Crohn's disease
* Dispo ICU, with family discussion regarding goals of care
* Code status: OK to intubate, appreciate ethics and palliative care recommendations."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue lasix boluses to attempt to diuresis 100 cc/hr if BP
   will tolerate
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Currently comfortable and satting well on NC, and allows
   patient to get more rest as she is uncomfortable on BiPAP
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will follow cutures
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above.
   -f/u on Cardiology recs
   -Repeat ECHO to eval MR, and what appears to be worsening cardiac
   failure despite aggressive in house diuresis from admission
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem, but appears to break
   through, will start on Diltiazem drip
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
   -          continue abx as above
 COAGULOPATHY
   -Markedly improved with small vitamin K dosing
   -will not restart coumadin at this time, but will place patient on SQ
   heparin
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH, repeat TSH low, but FT4 normal, will not take further
   action at this time
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 68-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute heart failure, atrial fibrillation, fever, coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus, thyroid cancer, and renal failure. She has a history of Crohn's disease, decubitus ulcer, and delirium/confusion. The patient is receiving various medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and insulin. She is also receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and has a PICC line and arterial line in place.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, and she may develop worsening respiratory failure if not managed appropriately. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and hypoxemia may arise.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute heart failure may worsen if not managed with diuretics and other medications. Complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary edema may occur.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, if not managed with anticoagulant therapy.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed with diuretics and other medications. Complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia may occur.
5. Infection: The patient's fever may be secondary to a pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infection. Complications such as sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction may arise if not managed appropriately.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and decubitus ulcer may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bleeding.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's delirium/confusion may worsen if not managed with medications and other interventions. Complications such as seizures, coma, and brain herniation may occur.
8. Endocrine Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus and thyroid cancer may lead to endocrine complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and thyroid storm.
9. Nutritional Complications: The patient's malnutrition and glycemic control issues may lead to nutritional complications such as malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."
