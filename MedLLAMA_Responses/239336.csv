You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a liver transplant recipient with a history of ulcerative colitis, anoxic brain damage, renal failure, and hypernatremia. They are currently in the ICU and have been receiving antibiotics, fluids, and other medications to manage their conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 98/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels indicating ongoing renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's continued positive C-diff test and elevated white blood cell count may indicate ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential complications.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications, including seizures, if not managed properly.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and ongoing C-diff infection may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's anoxic brain damage may lead to ongoing neurological complications, including seizures, cognitive impairment, or even death.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing antibiotic therapy may increase the risk of infection, including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or Aspergillus.
7. Bleeding: The patient's liver transplant and ongoing anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's ongoing fluid and electrolyte management may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, or hyperkalemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,

   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give 100 meq sodium bicarb in d5w at 200 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal

   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation and ulcerative colitis, admitted to the ICU with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. She has been receiving aggressive fluid repletion and sodium bicarbonate infusions to manage her hypernatremia. Her creatinine levels have improved, and she is expected to continue to trend towards resolution of acute renal failure. She is also being treated empirically for C. difficile infection and has a pending urine culture. The patient's cognitive deficits are being managed with her home medications, and she is receiving ICU care until her access is established and sodium levels are stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. C. difficile infection: The patient's history of institutionalization and previous C. difficile infection make it likely that she has contracted the infection again. If left untreated, C. difficile infection can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and even death.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to volume depletion, but the possibility of ATN cannot be ruled out. If left untreated, ATN can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's sodium bicarbonate infusions may lead to hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still elevated, and if not managed properly, can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
5. Cytokine storm: The patient's history of liver transplantation and chronic institutionalization make her susceptible to cytokine storms, which can lead to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's history of liver transplantation and chronic liver disease make her susceptible to liver dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of institutionalization make her susceptible to infections, which can lead to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust her fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
2. Consider adding a potassium supplement to her infusions to prevent hypokalemia.
3. Continue to treat the patient empirically for C. difficile infection and monitor her response to treatment.
4. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist or a liver specialist to manage the patient's diarrhea and potential flare of ulcerative colitis.
5. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust her fluid management accordingly to prevent further kidney damage.
6. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis to her medication regimen to prevent stress ulcers.
7. Monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely to detect any signs of sepsis or multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.

   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following

   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation, ulcerative colitis, and anoxic brain damage. She is currently in the ICU with diarrhea, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and WBCs in her urine. She has been treated with antibiotics, but the cause of her diarrhea is unclear. Her tacrolimus level is 5.6, and she has been restarted on tacrolimus with daily checks. She has also been given flagyl for coverage of C. diff and cipro for coverage of UC. Her sodium level is 160, and she is being treated with D5W at 150 cc/hour to correct her hypernatremia. Her creatinine level is improving, and she is being monitored closely for any changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 160, which is above the normal range. This can cause symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and seizures. If left untreated, hypernatremia can lead to brain damage and even death.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving, but she is still at risk for acute renal failure. This can cause symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting.
3. C. diff Colitis: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but the cause of her diarrhea is unclear. C. diff colitis is a potential complication, and she will need to be monitored closely for any signs of infection.
4. UC Flare: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, and she may be experiencing a flare. This can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloody stools.
5. WBCs in Urine: The patient has WBCs in her urine, which may indicate a urinary tract infection. This will need to be monitored closely and treated if necessary.
6. Cognitive Deficits: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, which may affect her cognitive function. She will need to be monitored closely for any changes in her mental status.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's sodium level is 160, and she is being treated with D5W to correct her hypernatremia. However, she may also have an electrolyte imbalance, which can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and heart palpitations."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  36 yo F with complicated medical hx--> ESLD
   [**1-26**] PSC s/p transplant X 2 in 4/[**2160**].  Initial transplant c/b acute
   rejection and cerebral edema, course further c/b respiratory failure,
   cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury now with significant cognitive
   impairment, hypothyroidism, UC, and sz d/o who chronically resides in
   rehab facility.  Transferred to OSH [**12-5**] and to [**Hospital1 54**] floor [**12-6**] for
   several days of abd pain and diarrhea, hypernatremia (154-161) and
   ARF.  Treated empirically for C diff with flagyl (PO at OSH changed to
   IV here).  Due to difficult access and need for frequent blood draws
   was transferred to ICU this am for further management. Renal c/s
   appreciated.  Fluids changed to D5W with slow improvement in
   hypernatremia. Flex sig yesterday--> inflammation c/w colitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until
   # WBCs in urine: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .
   # FEN: sips for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: subQ heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV, PICC assessment [**12-8**]
   .
   # CODE: full code, discussed with patient's husband

   # COMM: With patient and husband
   .
   # DISP: ICU care until access established and sodium stabilized

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  36 yo F with complicated medical hx--> ESLD
   [**1-26**] PSC s/p transplant X 2 in 4/[**2160**].  Initial transplant c/b acute
   rejection and cerebral edema, course further c/b respiratory failure,
   cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury now with significant cognitive
   impairment, hypothyroidism, UC, and sz d/o who chronically resides in
   rehab facility.  Transferred to OSH [**12-5**] and to [**Hospital1 54**] floor [**12-6**] for
   several days of abd pain and diarrhea, hypernatremia (154-161) and
   ARF.  Treated empirically for C diff with flagyl (PO at OSH changed to
   IV here).  Due to difficult access and need for frequent blood draws
   was transferred to ICU this am for further management. Renal c/s
   appreciated.  Fluids changed to D5W with slow improvement in
   hypernatremia. Flex sig yesterday--> inflammation c/w colitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until
   # WBCs in urine: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .
   # FEN: sips for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: subQ heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV, PICC assessment [**12-8**]
   .
   # CODE: full code, discussed with patient's husband
   .
   # COMM: With patient and husband
   .
   # DISP: ICU care until access established and sodium stabilized

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until
   # WBCs in urine: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation twice, admitted to the ICU with diarrhea and hypernatremia. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to volume depletion with the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.5Â°C, Heart rate 101 bpm, Blood pressure 116/71 mmHg, Respiratory rate 22 inspirations per minute, Oxygen saturation 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) not assessed.
* Fluid balance: Total fluid intake 5,620 mL, total fluid output 785 mL, with a balance of 4,835 mL.
* Laboratory results: Sodium 160 mmol/L, Potassium 3.7 mmol/L, Chloride 140 mmol/L, Creatinine 1.7 mg/dL, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 104 mg/dL, Glucose 143 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed, Right DP pulse not assessed, Left DP pulse not assessed. Skin: Not assessed. Neurologic: Responds to stimuli not assessed, Movement not assessed, Tone not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 160 mmol/L, which is higher than the normal range. This can lead to central pontine myelinolysis, seizures, and cerebral edema.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infection.
* Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and increased risk of sepsis.
* WBCs in urine: The patient's urine contains white blood cells, which can indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI).
* Cognitive deficits: The patient's cognitive deficits may be related to anoxic brain damage or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, which can lead to long-term cognitive impairment.
* Liver transplant complications: The patient's history of liver transplantation may increase her risk of complications such as rejection, infection, and bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue to monitor the patient's sodium level and replete it with sodium bicarbonate instead of sodium chloride.
* Restart tacrolimus to treat acute renal failure.
* Cover empirically for C. diff with flagyl.
* Add ciprofloxacin to treat possible UTI.
* Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cognitive status and adjust medications as needed.
* Consider a liver transplant evaluation to assess the patient's eligibility for a third liver transplant."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.  Seen by renal
   started on D5W with improvement.  Na correction 11 points since
   previous blood draw.
   - will decrease D%W to 100 cc / hour, slow down Na correction but
   continue fluid repletion for stool output
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard
   - continue to monitor Na level
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6. [**12-9**] level 5.2.
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving to 1.1 [**12-9**]
   - renal following
   - issue resolved
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C-diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until CMV cx is negative
   .
   # UTI: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Liver transplant: pt with liver ransplant
   -cont tacrolimus
   -will start Valcyte to cover for CMV, will await cx results

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation, ulcerative colitis, and chronic institutionalization. She was admitted with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.5Â°C, Tcurrent 36.5Â°C, HR 101 bpm, BP 116/71 mmHg, RR 22 inspirations per minute, SpO2 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving heparin sodium prophylaxis and has a total fluid balance of 5,620 mL, with 1,225 mL being infused in the last 24 hours.
* Laboratory results: The patient's sodium level is 160 mmol/L, potassium level is 4.3 mmol/L, creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28.7 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count is 10.8 K/uL, and her platelet count is 104 K/uL.
* Physical examination: The patient is tachycardic, with a mild tachypnea and hyperactive bowel sounds. Her peripheral pulses are not assessable.
* Review of systems: The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of diarrhea and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 160 mmol/L, which can lead to dehydration, seizures, and coma if not corrected promptly.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, which indicates ongoing renal impairment. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infection.
* Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be secondary to C. difficile infection, ulcerative colitis, or other causes. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infection.
* Liver transplant: The patient has a history of liver transplantation, which can increase her risk of complications such as rejection, infection, and bleeding.
* Cognitive deficits: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, which can affect her cognitive function and increase her risk of complications such as seizures and coma.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued fluid repletion with sodium bicarbonate to correct her hypernatremia.
* Aggressive treatment of her diarrhea with antibiotics and antidiarrheal agents.
* Monitoring of her renal function and electrolyte levels to prevent further complications.
* Continued treatment of her liver transplant with tacrolimus and valganciclovir.
* Monitoring of her cognitive function and adjusting her medications as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including hypernatremia, acute renal failure, diarrhea, and liver transplant complications. She requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent these complications and improve her overall outcome."

   Na is correcting appropriately with free water.  PO intake remains poor
   but she is taking clear liqs
 hard to tell if she is thirsty.  First
   stool is pending but seems most likely output is due to her colitis
   which will likely require steroids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.  Seen by renal
   started on D5W with improvement.  Na correction 11 points since
   previous blood draw.
   - will decrease D%W to 100 cc / hour, slow down Na correction but
   continue fluid repletion for stool output
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard
   - continue to monitor Na level
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6. [**12-9**] level 5.2.
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving to 1.1 [**12-9**]
   - renal following
   - issue resolved
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C-diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until CMV cx is negative
   .
   # UTI: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Liver transplant: pt with liver ransplant
   -cont tacrolimus
   -will start Valcyte to cover for CMV, will await cx results
   -tacro levels daily, follow hep recs re: dosing
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation and ulcerative colitis. She was admitted with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. The patient's sodium levels are still elevated, and the healthcare team is planning to slow down the sodium correction and continue fluid repletion for stool output. The patient's creatinine levels have improved, and the healthcare team is monitoring her for any signs of acute tubular necrosis. The patient is also being treated for a urinary tract infection and covered empirically for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's liver transplant team is involved in her care, and she is being started on valganciclovir to cover for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still elevated, and further repletion with sodium chloride may be necessary. However, the healthcare team is planning to slow down the sodium correction to avoid further complications.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but the healthcare team is monitoring her for any signs of acute tubular necrosis. Further fluid repletion and close monitoring of her renal function are necessary.
3. C. diff infection: The patient is being covered empirically for C. diff infection, and a stool sample is pending. If the test is positive, further treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin may be necessary.
4. UTI: The patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection, and the healthcare team is awaiting sensitivities to determine the best course of treatment.
5. Liver transplant complications: The patient's liver transplant team is involved in her care, and she is being started on valganciclovir to cover for CMV infection. The healthcare team is also monitoring her for any signs of liver dysfunction or rejection.
6. Cognitive deficits: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, and the healthcare team is monitoring her for any signs of cognitive decline or changes in her mental status.
7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance is a concern, and the healthcare team is monitoring her closely to ensure that her levels are within a safe range.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."
