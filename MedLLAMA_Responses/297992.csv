   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Pt is a 55 y/o female w/ hx of DMII, CAD, HTN, and CHF (EF 55%) who
   presented w/ hyperglycemia.
   #Hyperglycemia: Patient w/ long history of diabets, followed by her PCP
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1324**]. Last Hbg A1C of 9.3, new one pending.  Current
   hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid injection in ortho clinic. Pt
   developed BG > 600 and was symptomatic. No ketones in urine, and an AG
   of 15. AG closed w/ fluids.  Insulin gtt d/c'd yesterday, still w/
   persistently high BS.  SS increased, and sugars appear to b e moving in
   the correct direction.
   -- continue increased SS and fixed dose
   -- f/u pending HbgA1C
   # CAD: Patient w/ evidence of prior IMI and possible anterior MI on
   EKG. No current complaints of CP. EKG w/o any acute changes. Continue
   patients statin. Unclear why not on ASA, as is a DM w/ CAD. Also,
   patient not on BB, but suspect is related to hx of asthma.
   # HTN: Patient w/ hx of HTN. Hypertensive on this admission. Continue
   outpatinet regiment of verapimil and lisinopril. BP still elevated, LVH
   on EKG
   -- increased lisinopril dose
   # Diastolic HF: Patient [**Name (NI) **] in [**2193**] showed EF > 55% with symmetric LV
   hypterophy.  Unclear why patinet is not on BB. Will continue patients
   lasix 80mg daily and lisinopril.
   #Psych: Patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1325**] as an outpatinet. Will continue OP
   regiment of wellbutrin, seroquel, and effexor.
   #PE: Patinet w/ hx of PE x 2. Takes coumadin at a stable dose of 7mg
   daily. INR on admission was 4.6, will hold coumadin, and restart when
   no nolonger supratherapeutic.
   #CRI: Per chart, patinet w/ hx of CRI, but baseline Cr of 1.0. Believed
   diabetic/htn nephropathy w/ protinuria. Cr on admission is 1.5. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   elevated from diuresis from hyper glycemia. Also, patient taking
   gabapentin as renally toxic levels. Will continue IVF hydration and see
   if resolves.
   Will continue patinets renagel and lisinopril.
   #Asthma: Patient w/ hx of asthma. Will continue singular and advair.
   Wheezy on exam, started albuterol nebs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. She presented to the ICU with hyperglycemia, with a blood glucose level of 301 mg/dL. Her current medications include insulin sliding scale, lisinopril, and pantoprazole. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination is notable for wheezing on lung examination and absent peripheral pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level remains elevated, despite insulin sliding scale and NPH dose titrations. This may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome, or even death.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, which may increase her risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is taking gabapentin, which may be contributing to her renal impairment. This may lead to further decline in renal function, acute kidney injury, or chronic kidney disease.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of asthma and is wheezing on examination. This may lead to further respiratory complications, such as bronchospasm, pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's absent peripheral pulses may indicate peripheral artery disease or atherosclerosis, which may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or peripheral neuropathy.
6. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. This may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance. This may lead to further complications, such as congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her hyperglycemia, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, neurological, and infectious complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Pt is a 55 y/o female w/ hx of DMII, CAD, HTN, and CHF (EF 55%) who
   presented w/ hyperglycemia.
   #Hyperglycemia: Patient w/ long history of diabets, followed by her PCP
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1324**]. Last Hbg A1C of 9.3, new one pending.  Current
   hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid injection in ortho clinic. Pt
   developed BG > 600 and was symptomatic. No ketones in urine, and an AG
   of 15. AG closed w/ fluids.  Insulin gtt d/c'd yesterday, still w/
   persistently high BS.  SS increased, and sugars appear to b e moving in
   the correct direction.
   -- continue increased SS and fixed dose
   -- f/u pending HbgA1C
   # CAD: Patient w/ evidence of prior IMI and possible anterior MI on
   EKG. No current complaints of CP. EKG w/o any acute changes. Continue
   patients statin. Unclear why not on ASA, as is a DM w/ CAD. Also,
   patient not on BB, but suspect is related to hx of asthma.
   # HTN: Patient w/ hx of HTN. Hypertensive on this admission. Continue
   outpatinet regiment of verapimil and lisinopril. BP still elevated, LVH
   on EKG
   -- increased lisinopril dose
   # Diastolic HF: Patient [**Name (NI) **] in [**2193**] showed EF > 55% with symmetric LV
   hypterophy.  Unclear why patinet is not on BB. Will continue patients
   lasix 80mg daily and lisinopril.
   #Psych: Patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1325**] as an outpatinet. Will continue OP
   regiment of wellbutrin, seroquel, and effexor.
   #PE: Patinet w/ hx of PE x 2. Takes coumadin at a stable dose of 7mg
   daily. INR on admission was 4.6, will hold coumadin, and restart when
   no nolonger supratherapeutic.
   #CRI: Per chart, patinet w/ hx of CRI, but baseline Cr of 1.0. Believed
   diabetic/htn nephropathy w/ protinuria. Cr on admission is 1.5. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   elevated from diuresis from hyper glycemia. Also, patient taking
   gabapentin as renally toxic levels. Will continue IVF hydration and see
   if resolves.
   Will continue patinets renagel and lisinopril.
   #Asthma: Patient w/ hx of asthma. Will continue singular and advair.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic heart failure. She presented with hyperglycemia, which was managed with insulin sliding scale and NPH dose adjustments. The patient's blood sugar levels continued to be elevated, reaching 301 mg/dL.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Coronary artery disease with possible anterior myocardial infarction, for which she is not receiving aspirin or beta-blockers due to a history of asthma.
2. Hypertension, which is being managed with verapamil and lisinopril, with a recent increase in the lisinopril dose.
3. Diastolic heart failure, with left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 55%.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II, with a history of poor glycemic control and a recent episode of hyperglycemia.
5. Chronic kidney disease, with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 and a current creatinine of 1.5.
6. Pulmonary embolism, for which she is taking coumadin, which is being held due to a supratherapeutic INR.
7. Asthma, for which she is taking Singular and Advair, with wheezing on examination.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin A1C: 9.3
* Blood glucose: 301 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.5
* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): Not reported
* White blood cell count: 15.3
* Platelet count: 242
* International normalized ratio (INR): 2.1

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hyperglycemia-related complications, such as ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma.
2. Cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or heart failure exacerbation.
3. Kidney injury or failure due to hyperglycemia, dehydration, or underlying chronic kidney disease.
4. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility or underlying hypercoagulability.
5. Asthma exacerbation due to respiratory infections or environmental triggers.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration or gastritis.
7. Infection or sepsis due to immunosuppression or underlying medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued management of hyperglycemia with insulin sliding scale and NPH dose adjustments.
2. Monitoring of blood sugar levels and adjusting insulin therapy as needed.
3. Management of hypertension with verapamil and lisinopril.
4. Monitoring of kidney function and adjusting fluid management and medication dosing as needed.
5. Continued prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulceration.
6. Monitoring of pulmonary function and adjusting asthma therapy as needed.
7. Regular assessments of the patient's overall condition and adjusting the plan of care as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with hyperglycemia and anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 68 bpm (51-70)
* Blood pressure: 158/71 mmHg (94-109/66-111)
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (12-23)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for being well-nourished, with no acute distress, and being overweight/obese. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or gallop sounds. Her respiratory examination is also normal, with clear breath sounds and good air movement.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 15.3 K/uL (13.4 K/uL yesterday)
* Platelet count: 242 (211 yesterday)
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL (1.1 mg/dL yesterday)
* Glucose: 301 mg/dL (156 mg/dL yesterday)
* Electrolytes: normal
* Blood urea nitrogen: 35 mg/dL
* Serum potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
* Serum sodium: 133 mEq/L

The patient's medical issues include:

* Hyperglycemia/anion gap (HONK) requiring insulin drip and adjustment of sliding scale and NPH doses
* Mild creatinine elevation on admission, now at baseline after IV fluids
* Supratherapeutic INR, requiring Coumadin hold and restart at home dose
* Leukocytosis likely from steroids, normalizing, with CXR if spikes and u/a clean and knee without evidence of infection
* HTN/DDFX requiring adjustment of home medications, including increasing lisinopril dose
*?OSA at night, potentially benefiting from outpatient sleep evaluation

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening hyperglycemia and anion gap
* Kidney damage or failure due to hyperglycemia and/or prerenal azotemia
* Increased risk of bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR
* Infection or sepsis due to leukocytosis and/or u/a findings
* Hypertensive crisis or cardiovascular events due to uncontrolled hypertension
* Sleep apnea exacerbation or respiratory compromise due to obesity and chronic kidney disease
* Cardiovascular events or arrhythmias due to underlying coronary artery disease and diastolic congestive heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F w/  DMII, cad, htn, diastolic chf presents with
   hyperglycemia/anion gap (honk) following steroid injection for chronic
   knee pain.
   Improved control obtained with insulin drip and transitioned from drip
   to NPH and humalog with SSI though still with suboptimal control,
   likely related to diet and recent steroids.  She has no infectious
   signs or symptoms to suggest additional etiology Adjusting nph and
   sliding scale doses.  Consider [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult as pt is not followed by
   [**Last Name (un) 276**] as outpt but may benefit, given elevated Hb a1C.   Pt reports
   having similar acute hyperglycemia in past with steroid injections as
   well as oral steroids (for asthma).
   Additional issues include:
        -CRI--noted to have mild creatinine elevation on admit, in setting
   of hyperglycemia, now at baseline after IVFs.  Monitor with increased
   ace-i dose
        -Supratherapeutic INR.  Coumadin held and now 2.1,  Restarting at
   home dose--continue to monitor given high level on admit.
        -Leukocytosis-likely from steroids and now normalizing, cx if
   spikes, u/a clean and knee without evidence of infection.
        -HTN/ddfx--adjusting home meds for improved control-- increasing
   lisinopril dose today
        ? OSA--would benefit from outpt sleep evaluation, and has multiple
   risks for sleep disordered breathing with dm and chf

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with hyperglycemia and anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 158/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, well-nourished, and overweight/obese.

Laboratory results show:

* Blood glucose levels: 301 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1C: 13.4%
* White blood cell count: 15.3
* Platelet count: 242
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 35 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 24 mmol/L

The patient has several medical issues, including:

* Hyperglycemia with anion gap (HONK)
* Mild creatinine elevation
* Supratherapeutic INR
* Leukocytosis
* Hypertension
* Diabetic ketoacidosis

The patient's medications include:

* Insulin drip and transitioned to NPH and Humalog with sliding scale insulin
* Lisinopril (increased dose)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Coumadin (held and restarted at home dose)
* Augmentin (oral)
* Trazodone HCL
* Lipitor (oral)
* Reglan (oral)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) due to uncontrolled diabetes
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to uncontrolled diabetes and/or steroid use
* Cardiovascular complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias due to hypertension and coronary artery disease
* Respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hyperglycemia and/or steroid use
* Gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea and abdominal pain due to hyperglycemia and/or steroid use
* Neurological complications such as seizures and coma due to hyperglycemia and/or steroid use

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her medications and treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
