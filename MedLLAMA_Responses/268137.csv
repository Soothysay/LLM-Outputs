   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA,
   afib on coumadin with supratherapeutic INR who presents with
   hypotension in setting of RP bleed and crit drop.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension: Patient has known RP bleed seen on CT scan.  Repeat
   CT-scan w/ contrast did not show expansion of the hematoma. The RP
   bleed is likely cause of her hypotension. Likely in setting of elevated
   INR. She has a crit drop from 24-->16 since yesterday --> was given 2U
   pRBC 30.4 today and 2U FFP. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac neg). No
   fever, white count to suggest infection. EKG wnl.

   -monitor on tele
   -No evidence of hemolysis
   -cross match 4 units
   -check crit q6
   - transfuse for Hct < 30
   .
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely [**12-30**] to transfusion of blood products causing
   flash pulmonary edema. Pt given lasix, morphine, and started on nitro
   drip for hypertension.  Pt improving.
   - cont to monitor and check I/O
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient likely volume depleted and has been receiving
   [**11-29**] normal maintenance fluids. Appears dry clinically. Urine sodium was
   10 with osm > 300 further supporting this hypothesis. Improving thus
   far with normal saline bolus from 117-->121-->125.
   -cont to monitor q8 lytes
   -continue NS if needed for bolus for hypotension, currently receiving
   blood
   .
   # Low back pain: no neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back pain may
   have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on admission showed
   a ? left pelvic mass. Will hold narcotics given low blood pressure.
   -cont lidoderm patch
   -cont tizanidine
   -cont gabapentin
   .
   # Coagulopathy- Patient is on coumadin but unclear why her INR
   increased on admission and continued to do so after holding her
   coumadin. No recent antibiotics or new meds that would interfere with
   coumadin. Pt given 2U FFP and 10mg po vit K.  INR now1.8
   - monitor coags
   .
   # CAD: EKG wnl. Given bleeding and hypotension, will hold asa, plavix
   and bp meds. Cont statin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and afib on coumadin, who presented with hypotension and critical drop in hemoglobin (Hb) level due to RP bleed. She has been diagnosed with flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by the transfusion of blood products. The patient has also been found to have hyponatremia, which is improving with normal saline bolus. She has low back pain, but no neurologic deficits on exam. The patient's INR has increased, and she has been given 2U FFP and 10mg po vit K. She is being monitored for coagulopathy, and her anticoagulation medications have been held. The patient has a history of CAD, and her EKG is normal. She is being held on aspirin, Plavix, and blood pressure medications due to bleeding and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's critical drop in Hb level and hypotension increase the risk of hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not managed promptly.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's flash pulmonary edema can worsen and lead to respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia can worsen if not managed properly, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's increased INR and history of coumadin therapy increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and afib increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of CVA increase the risk of infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
7. Low back pain: The patient's low back pain can worsen if not managed effectively, leading to chronic pain and disability.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to take food orally and history of CVA increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA,
   afib on coumadin with supratherapeutic INR who presents with
   hypotension in setting of RP bleed and crit drop.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension: Patient has known RP bleed seen on CT scan.  Repeat
   CT-scan w/ contrast did not show expansion of the hematoma. The RP
   bleed is likely cause of her hypotension. Likely in setting of elevated
   INR. She has a crit drop from 24-->16 since yesterday --> was given 2U
   pRBC 30.4 today and 2U FFP. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac neg). No
   fever, white count to suggest infection. EKG wnl.

   -No evidence of hemolysis
   -cross match 4 units
   -check crit q6
   - transfuse for Hct < 25
   - monitor neuro status and renal function
   .
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely [**12-30**] to transfusion of blood products causing
   flash pulmonary edema. Pt given lasix, morphine, and started on nitro
   drip for hypertension.  Pt improving.
   - cont to monitor and check I/O
   - monitor respiratory status
   - if pt needs fluid/ blood products should be given gently

   # Hyponatremia: Patient likely volume depleted and has been receiving
   [**11-29**] normal maintenance fluids. Appears dry clinically. Urine sodium was
   10 with osm > 300 further supporting this hypothesis. Improving thus
   far with normal saline bolus from 117-->121-->125.
   -cont to monitor q8 lytes
   -continue NS if needed for bolus for hypotension, currently receiving
   blood.  Will start diet and monitor lytes.  Appears to be self
   correcting without intervention.

   # Low back pain: no neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back pain may
   have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on admission showed
   a ? left pelvic mass. Will hold narcotics given low blood pressure.
   -cont lidoderm patch

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and afib on coumadin, presenting with RP bleed, hypotension, and crit drop. She has a known left pelvic mass on L-spine imaging. The patient was given 2U pRBC and 2U FFP, and her INR is now 1.8. She has flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by transfusion of blood products, which is improving with lasix, morphine, and nitro drip. She also has hyponatremia, likely due to volume depletion, which is improving with normal saline bolus. The patient has low back pain, which may be related to the RP bleed, and is being managed with lidoderm patch, tizanidine, and gabapentin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's hypotension and crit drop may be indicative of hemorrhagic shock, which requires immediate attention and management.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's flash pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is still elevated, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to seizures, coma, or even death.
5. Low Back Pain: The patient's low back pain may be related to the RP bleed, and may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased mobility and increased risk of complications.
6. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be monitored and managed promptly.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and afib on coumadin may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's crit drop and hyponatremia may increase the risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely to detect any changes or complications early.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with fluids and blood products as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and respiratory status closely, and adjust management as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with FFP and vit K as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's hyponatremia and electrolyte levels closely, and adjust management as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's low back pain with lidoderm patch, tizanidine, and gabapentin.
7. Monitor the patient's WBC count and urine output closely, and adjust management as needed.
8. Consider consulting a cardiologist or nephrologist to manage the patient's cardiac and renal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and AFib on Coumadin, presenting with hypotension and a critical drop in hemoglobin level (22.6) due to a retroperitoneal (RP) hematoma. The patient has been transfused with 1 unit of PRBC and has had a repeat CT scan with contrast, which did not show expansion of the hematoma. The patient's INR is elevated, and she has been given 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 10 mg of oral vitamin K. The patient is currently stable, but at risk for pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, and cardiac complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation (89%) and bibasilar crackles on exam suggest possible pulmonary edema, which may be related to the transfusion of blood products. Close monitoring of respiratory status and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and recent bleeding may indicate a coagulopathy. Monitoring of coagulation studies and bleeding risk is essential.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD, AFib, and recent bleeding may increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent bleeding may increase her risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's recent bleeding may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure.
6. Infection: The patient's recent bleeding and decreased immune function may increase her risk for infection.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent bleeding and decreased blood volume may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and fluid balance closely.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulation studies and bleeding risk.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medications as necessary.
7. Consider prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to prevent infection and coagulopathy.
8. Consider adjusting the patient's cardiac diet and repleting electrolytes as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and AFib on coumadin, presenting with hypotension in the setting of a RP hematoma and crit drop.

The patient's vital signs are:

* MAP 50s
* HR 102 bpm
* BP 179/79 mmHg
* O2 sat 88-93% on 4-6 L NC
* RR 22 inspirations per minute
* TCO2 23 mmHg
* Glucose 90-112 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General appearance: no acute distress, thin
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 normal
* Respiratory: crackles in right lung fields, symmetric expansion
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: right and left radial pulses present, no expansion of hematoma beyond demarcated line
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hct 22.6-31.0%
* WBC 7.3-12.3 K/ul
* Platelets 243-325 K/ul
* Cr 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* TCO2 23 mmHg
* Glucose 90-112 mg/dL
* INR 1.2
* Ca++ 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++ 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring of Hct and transfusion for Hct <25
* Maintenance of PIV
* Tele monitoring
* Active type and screen
* Monitoring of neuro status and renal function
* Consideration of pulmonary edema due to blood product transfusion
* Monitoring of respiratory status
* Consideration of low back pain and potential relationship to RP bleed
* Holding of coumadin and warfarin due to elevated INR
* Holding of ASA and Plavix due to bleeding and hypotension
* Holding of metoprolol due to hypotension
* Continuation of levothyroxine
* Beginning of cardiac diet and repletion of electrolytes as needed

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia due to aspiration or sepsis
* Sepsis due to infection
* Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload or blood product transfusion
* Renal failure due to hypotension or electrolyte imbalance
* Hypothyroidism due to medication or underlying condition
* Cardiovascular complications due to CAD or AFib
* GI bleed due to underlying condition or medication
* Neurologic complications due to hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, or underlying condition

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential complications and adjust the plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F with afib and CAD; admitted with worsening of chronic back pain;
   subsequently devloped hypotension and dropping hematocrit; ultimately
   determined to have RP bleed in setting of supra-therapeutic INR.
   1.  RP Hematoma:  Her HCT is 30 this morning (increased from 23
   yesterday) and her hemodynamics are now stable.  RP bleed likely in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR as well as antiplatelet therapy (just
   recently discontinued plavix).   Unclear history of trauma. Currently
   her UOP is stable and she has an intact neurologic exam in her
   extremities.
   - Follow HCT q6-8h today, transfuse cautiously given difficulties with
   transfusions yesterday
   - Maintain peripheral access
   - Follow neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of
   expanding RP hematoma
   2.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: related to transfusion of PRBC,
   improved with diuresis.  Currently 94% on 6L NC.  Exam with bibasilar
   crackles.  Suggestive of CHF, though did not improve substantially with
   diuresis.  Also given her afib and history of diastolic dysfunction on
   TTE, this is most likely.  TRALI a consideration given temporal
   relationship with transfusions and persistent hypoxemia despite
   diuresis.
   - Caution regarding PRBC, use judiciously.
   - Given hemodynamic stability, will aim for diuresis today
   3.  CV: CHF and afib RVR with rate from 110-130
   - Diuresis with goal body balance negative 1L today.
   - Rate control to improve LVEDP and will likely improve pulmonary edema
   - holding plavix, coumadin in setting of bleed
   - Titrate beta blocker, given IV dose of lopressor now
   - Continue statin
   3.  Heme: supratherapeutic INR
 has history of labile INR.  No clear
   source.
   - Hold coumadin, follow INR
   5.  Hyponatremia:  Corrected with improvement in intravascular volume.
   Na 135 today.

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted with worsening chronic back pain. She developed hypotension and a dropping hematocrit, ultimately diagnosed with a retroperitoneal (RP) bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and antiplatelet therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics are stable, with a hematocrit of 30 this morning, increased from 23 yesterday.
* She has an intact neurologic exam and stable urine output.
* Her respiratory status is compromised, with worsening oxygenation despite diuresis and a diagnosis of hypoxemic respiratory failure.
* She has a history of diastolic dysfunction on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) and AF, making CHF a likely cause of her hypoxemia.
* TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) is also a consideration due to the temporal relationship with transfusions and persistent hypoxemia despite diuresis.
* The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, with no clear source, and is being held on coumadin.
* She has hyponatremia, which has improved with improvement in intravascular volume.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Expansion of the RP hematoma, which could lead to further bleeding or organ damage.
* Continued hypoxemia, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia, due to her AF and diastolic dysfunction.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to her supratherapeutic INR and antiplatelet therapy.
* Renal insufficiency or failure due to her hypotension, hypovolemia, and potential nephrotoxic medications.
* Worsening of her chronic back pain, which could lead to increased pain and discomfort.

The plan of care includes:

* Cautious transfusion of PRBC, with careful monitoring of her hemodynamics and hematocrit.
* Maintenance of peripheral access and continued monitoring of her neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of expanding RP hematoma.
* Diuresis to improve her hypoxemia and manage her fluid balance.
* Rate control to improve her left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and reduce her pulmonary edema.
* Holding of plavix and coumadin in the setting of bleed.
* Titration of beta blocker, given IV dose of lopressor now.
* Continued statin therapy.
* Monitoring of her INR and holding of coumadin until it normalizes.
* Correction of her hyponatremia, with continued monitoring of her electrolyte levels.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and careful management to prevent further complications and improve her clinical status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch tall individual with atrial fibrillation (AF) and is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for hypotension and volume overload. The patient has responded to fluid and blood administration, but is now experiencing worsening oxygenation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 144/78 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92%. The patient has a history of allergies to ACE inhibitors, and is currently receiving morphine, furosemide, and other medications.

Lab results show the patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 10.0, hemoglobin (HCT) is 22.6, and platelet count (PLT) is 243. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 17 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) is 0.9 mg/dL, and total CO2 (TCO2) is 23 mmHg. The patient's blood glucose level is 112 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 13.7 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 27.6 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2.

Radiology reports show evidence of interstitial edema on the patient's chest X-ray (CXR).

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening oxygenation and oxygen saturation of 92% may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
3. Volume overload: The patient's continued fluid administration may lead to further volume overload, exacerbating their hypotension and respiratory distress.
4. Infection: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile and elevated WBC count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be effective, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and prolonged ICU stay may increase their risk of developing DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F with afib and CAD; admitted with worsening of chronic back pain;
   subsequently devloped hypotension and dropping hematocrit; ultimately
   determined to have RP bleed in setting of supra-therapeutic INR.
   1.  RP Hematoma:  Her HCT is 30 this morning (increased from 23
   yesterday) and her hemodynamics are now stable.  RP bleed likely in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR as well as antiplatelet therapy (just
   recently discontinued plavix).   Unclear history of trauma. Currently
   her UOP is stable and she has an intact neurologic exam in her
   extremities.
   - Follow HCT q6-8h today, transfuse cautiously given difficulties with
   transfusions yesterday
   - Maintain peripheral access
   - Follow neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of
   expanding RP hematoma
   2.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: related to transfusion of PRBC,
   improved with diuresis.  Currently 94% on 6L NC.  Exam with bibasilar
   crackles.  Suggestive of CHF, though did not improve substantially with
   diuresis.  Also given her afib and history of diastolic dysfunction on
   TTE, this is most likely.  TRALI a consideration given temporal
   relationship with transfusions and persistent hypoxemia despite
   diuresis.
   - Caution regarding PRBC, use judiciously.
   - Given hemodynamic stability, will aim for diuresis today
   3.  CV: CHF and afib RVR with rate from 110-130
   - Diuresis with goal body balance negative 1L today.
   - Rate control to improve LVEDP and will likely improve pulmonary edema
   - holding plavix, coumadin in setting of bleed
   - Titrate beta blocker, given IV dose of lopressor now
   - Continue statin
   3.  Heme: supratherapeutic INR
 has history of labile INR.  No clear
   source.
   - Hold coumadin, follow INR
   5.  Hyponatremia:  Corrected with improvement in intravascular volume.
   Na 135 today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F with afib and CAD; admitted with worsening of chronic back pain;
   subsequently devloped hypotension and dropping hematocrit; ultimately
   determined to have RP bleed in setting of supra-therapeutic INR.
   1.  RP Hematoma:  Her HCT is 30 this morning (increased from 23
   yesterday) and her hemodynamics are now stable.  RP bleed likely in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR as well as antiplatelet therapy (just
   recently discontinued plavix).   Unclear history of trauma. Currently
   her UOP is stable and she has an intact neurologic exam in her
   extremities.
   - Follow HCT q6-8h today, transfuse cautiously given difficulties with
   transfusions yesterday
   - Maintain peripheral access
   - Follow neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of
   expanding RP hematoma
   2.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: related to transfusion of PRBC,
   improved with diuresis.  Currently 94% on 6L NC.  Exam with bibasilar
   crackles.  Suggestive of CHF, though did not improve substantially with
   diuresis.  Also given her afib and history of diastolic dysfunction on
   TTE, this is most likely.  TRALI a consideration given temporal
   relationship with transfusions and persistent hypoxemia despite
   diuresis.
   - Caution regarding PRBC, use judiciously.
   - Given hemodynamic stability, will aim for diuresis today
   3.  CV: CHF and afib RVR with rate from 110-130
   - Diuresis with goal body balance negative 1L today.
   - Rate control to improve LVEDP and will likely improve pulmonary edema
   - holding plavix, coumadin in setting of bleed
   - Titrate beta blocker, given IV dose of lopressor now
   - Continue statin
   3.  Heme: supratherapeutic INR
 has history of labile INR.  No clear
   source.
   - Hold coumadin, follow INR
   5.  Hyponatremia:  Corrected with improvement in intravascular volume.

Summary:

The patient is a 90+ year-old female with atrial fibrillation and CAD, admitted with worsening chronic back pain, who developed hypotension and dropping hematocrit. She was found to have a retroperitoneal (RP) bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and antiplatelet therapy. Her hemodynamics are now stable, but she still has worsening oxygenation and poor rate control. She has a history of labile INR and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Expanding RP hematoma: The patient's HCT is increasing, and her hemodynamics are stable, but she needs to be closely monitored for evidence of expanding RP hematoma.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has persistent hypoxemia despite diuresis, which may be related to TRALI or CHF.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient has atrial fibrillation, CHF, and diastolic dysfunction, which may worsen with continued hypoxemia.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient has a history of labile INR and is currently on anticoagulation therapy, which needs to be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's corrected sodium level is 135, which may indicate improvement in intravascular volume.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92%, and she has bibasilar rales on examination, which may indicate worsening respiratory failure.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including RP bleed, and needs to be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Closely monitoring her HCT and transfusing cautiously given difficulties with transfusions yesterday.
2. Maintaining peripheral access and following neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of expanding RP hematoma.
3. Cautiously using PRBC and aiming for diuresis today.
4. Titrating beta blocker to improve LVEDP and pulmonary edema.
5. Holding plavix and coumadin in the setting of bleed.
6. Continuing statin therapy.
7. Monitoring INR and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
8. Providing cardiac prudent diet and glycemic control.
9. Maintaining prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
10. Continuing to monitor the patient's condition and adjusting the plan as necessary."

 No growth to date
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, afib on coumadin with
   supratherapeutic INR presented with hypotension in setting of RP bleed
   and crit drop.
   #. RP Bleed: Seen on CT scan.  Repeat CT-scan w/ contrast did not show
   expansion of the hematoma.  Likely in setting of elevated INR
   trauma by history. Given 2U pRBCs since admission. Hematocrit stable
   over past 24 hours. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac neg).
   - Trend back hematocrit checks to [**Hospital1 **]; given history of CAD, transfuse
   if hematocrit drops below 25
   - Maintain [**12-31**] PIV
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - In addition to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give IVF prn for hypotension
 given 250cc
   bolus overnight with good response
   #. Pulmonary edema, now improving: Occurred twice following transfusion
   of [**First Name3 (LF) **] products > causing flash pulmonary edema. Pt again became SOB
   after [**First Name3 (LF) **] products, improved with lasix and morphine. Diuresed very
   well with furosemide yesterday. Chest radiograph with considerable
   improvement
 slightly worse today, possible related to positioning.
   Reason unclear
 may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   - Decrease goal for net fluid output given that patient became
   hypotensive yesterday evening after considerable diuresis
   - Closely monitor respiratory status with administration of fluids
   - Awaiting TTE to evaluate heart function, provide more clear answer
   regarding reason for flash pulmonary edema
   # AF: Continues to be tachycardic
   - Metoprolol increased to 50mg PO TID; also given IV beta-blocker 2-3x
   with minimal response
   - As beta-blocker not working well to control rate and BP running low,
   consider switch to calcium-channel blocker or adding on digoxin
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold anticoagulation at this time given recent RP bleed
   - Restart ASA tomorrow if hematocrit remains stable
   # Low back pain: no neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back pain may
   have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on admission showed
   a ? left pelvic mass. Has history of chronic low back pain. Will hold
   narcotics given low [**Month/Day (2) **] pressure.
   - tylenol prn
   - oxycodone prn for break thru pain
   -cont lidoderm patch
   -cont tizanidine
   -cont gabapentin
   # Coagulopathy- Patient is on coumadin but unclear why her INR
   increased on admission and continued to do so after holding her
   coumadin. No recent antibiotics or new meds that would interfere with
   coumadin. Pt given 3U FFP and 10mg po vit K.  INR now 1.2
   - monitor coags
   # CAD: Admission EKG wnl. Given bleeding and hypotension, will hold
   asa, plavix and bp meds. Cont statin.
   # HTN: Started metoprolol for rate control.
   # Hypothyroidism: Cont levothyroxine

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with hypotension and a critical drop in hematocrit due to a RP bleed. She was given 2U pRBCs and her hematocrit has remained stable over the past 24 hours. She also has pulmonary edema, which is improving, but may be related to atrial fibrillation with RVR. Her INR is elevated, and she is on anticoagulation therapy. She has a history of CAD, hypertension, and hypothyroidism, and is being treated with metoprolol, furosemide, and other medications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is improving, but may worsen if she develops atrial fibrillation with RVR or if her INR remains elevated.
2. Bleeding: The patient's RP bleed is stable, but she is at risk for further bleeding due to her elevated INR and anticoagulation therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if she develops sepsis or if her medications are not effective in controlling her blood pressure.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if she develops RVR, which could lead to pulmonary edema and hypotension.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR may worsen if she develops further bleeding or if her anticoagulation therapy is not effective.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if she develops further bleeding or if her medications are not effective in controlling her thyroid function.
7. CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen if she develops further bleeding or if her medications are not effective in controlling her blood flow.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and adjust her medications as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medications as necessary to control her hypotension.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her medications as necessary to control her heart rate and rhythm.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as necessary to prevent further bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and adjust her medications as necessary to control her thyroid function.
7. Monitor the patient's CAD and adjust her medications as necessary to control her blood flow.

Note: The patient's medical history and current condition are complex, and it is recommended that a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including cardiologists, intensivists, and primary care physicians, be involved in her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, afib on coumadin with
   supratherapeutic INR presented with hypotension in setting of RP bleed
   and crit drop.
   #. RP Bleed: Seen on CT scan.  Repeat CT-scan w/ contrast did not show
   expansion of the hematoma.  Likely in setting of elevated INR
   trauma by history. Given 2U pRBCs since admission. Hematocrit stable
   over past 24 hours. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac neg).
   - Trend back hematocrit checks to [**Hospital1 **]; given history of CAD, transfuse
   if hematocrit drops below 25
   - Maintain [**12-31**] PIV
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - In addition to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give IVF prn for hypotension
 given 250cc
   bolus overnight with good response
   #. Pulmonary edema, now resolved: Occurred twice following transfusion
   of [**First Name3 (LF) **] products > causing flash pulmonary edema. Pt again became SOB
   after [**First Name3 (LF) **] products, improved with lasix and morphine. Diuresed very
   well with furosemide yesterday. Chest radiograph with considerable
   improvement. Reason unclear
 may be secondary to atrial fibrillation
   with RVR.
   - Decrease goal for net fluid output given that patient became
   hypotensive yesterday evening after considerable diuresis
   - Closely monitor respiratory status with administration of fluids
   - Awaiting TTE to evaluate heart function, provide more clear answer
   regarding reason for flash pulmonary edema
   # AF: Continues to be tachycardic
   - Metoprolol increased to 50mg PO TID; also given IV beta-blocker 2-3x
   with minimal response
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold anticoagulation at this time given recent RP bleed
   # Low back pain: no neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back pain may
   have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on admission showed
   a ? left pelvic mass. Has history of chronic low back pain. Will hold
   narcotics given low [**Month/Day (2) **] pressure.
   - tylenol prn
   - oxycodone prn for break thru pain
   -cont lidoderm patch
   -cont tizanidine
   -cont gabapentin
   # Coagulopathy- Patient is on coumadin but unclear why her INR
   increased on admission and continued to do so after holding her
   coumadin. No recent antibiotics or new meds that would interfere with
   coumadin. Pt given 3U FFP and 10mg po vit K.  INR now 1.2
   - monitor coags
   # CAD: EKG wnl. Given bleeding and hypotension, will hold asa, plavix
   and bp meds. Cont statin.
   # HTN: started metoprolol for rate control.  Monitor BP for hyoptension
   # Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine
   # FEN: begin cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access- 3 PIV
   # PPx:  protonix, pneumoboots, bowel regimen
   # Code:  Full Code, confirmed with HCP

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presented with hypotension and a critical drop in hematocrit, likely due to a retroperitoneal bleed. She has been treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit has stabilized.

The patient has been experiencing pulmonary edema, which has resolved with treatment. She has also been experiencing tachycardia, which has been managed with metoprolol and IV beta-blocker.

The patient has a coagulopathy, with an increased INR, which has been treated with 3 units of fresh frozen plasma and 10mg of oral vitamin K. Her INR has normalized.

The patient has a history of CAD and is on coumadin, which may have contributed to her coagulopathy. She is also on anticoagulation therapy, which is being held due to her recent retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and fenfluramine use. She is on a cardiac diet and is being repleted with electrolytes as needed.

The patient has a total of three peripheral IV lines, and is receiving protonix, pneumoboots, and a bowel regimen.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of retroperitoneal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to her coagulopathy.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has experienced pulmonary edema twice, which may be related to her atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to her bleeding and coagulopathy.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which may be due to her atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may increase her risk of bleeding and other complications.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiac complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, which may be due to her pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."
