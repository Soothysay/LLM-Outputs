   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q6h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider early renal consult for ?need for HD to get through acute
   period if developing anuric ATN.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Right IJ, peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q6h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider early renal consult for ?need for HD to get through acute
   period if developing anuric ATN.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, resulting in hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from an acute RP bleed. The patient has undergone coiling by IR to stop the hemorrhage, and labs are improving, including a decrease in metabolic acidosis and lactate levels, as well as improved pressor requirements and blood pressures.

The patient is currently being managed for:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient is being closely monitored for signs of active bleeding, and IV access is being maintained. The patient is also being transfused with PRBCs and is being monitored for CVP.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed hypoxic respiratory failure, and is being oxygenated and ventilated on minimal settings. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration from altered mental status, hypoventilation from shock, ARDS, and PE.
3. Retroperitoneal mass: The patient has an enhancing retroperitoneal mass, which is being managed with close follow-up with general surgery and imaging studies.
4. Low urine output: The patient has oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI), which is being managed with fluid resuscitation, electrolyte monitoring, and consideration of early renal consult for hemodialysis.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a combination of lactic acidosis from shock and potential renal failure-related acidosis.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is being monitored, and antibiotics are being held off for now.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has reactive leukocytosis from acute stressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the retroperitoneal mass, which could lead to further hypotension and shock.
2. Respiratory failure, which could worsen if the patient's condition does not improve.
3. Acute kidney injury, which could lead to anuric ATN if not managed promptly.
4. Metabolic acidosis, which could worsen if not managed with adequate fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement.
5. Hypothermia, which could lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
6. Infection, which could arise from the retroperitoneal mass or other sources, and could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Bowel necrosis, which could arise from compromised blood supply to the duodenum.

The patient is being closely monitored and managed by the ICU team, with regular updates and adjustments to her care plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Right IJ, peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.
   # Communication: husband (cell - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12403**])

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, leading to hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from an acute RP bleed.
* The patient has undergone coiling by IR to attempt to stop the hemorrhage, with no evidence of residual bleed.
* Labs are improving, with improvement in metabolic acidosis, lactate, and pressor requirements/BPs.
* The patient is still oliguric, with a urine output of 50 cc/hr for the past 3 hours.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hemorrhagic Shock:** The patient's bleeding is still a concern, and further bleeding could lead to worsening shock and potentially life-threatening consequences.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient has developed hypoxic respiratory failure, which may worsen if not properly managed. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration from altered mental status, hypoventilation from shock, ARDS, and PE.
3. **Retroperitoneal Mass:** The mass is still a concern, and further imaging is needed to determine its nature and extent. The differential diagnosis includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large metastasis, infection, schwannoma, or Castleman disease.
4. **Low Urine Output:** The patient's oliguria is likely due to new ARF, which may be prerenal, ATN, or related to mass compression of the kidney/vessels/ureter.
5. **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to a combination of lactic acidosis from shock and potentially renal failure-related acidosis.
6. **Hypothermia:** The patient's initial hypothermia has been resolved, but there is still a risk of hypothermia if not properly managed.
7. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's leukocytosis is likely reactive from acute stressors, but there is a low threshold to cover with antibiotics given the overall instability.
8. **Bowel Necrosis:** The patient's risk of bowel necrosis is increased due to the potential disruption of blood supply to the duodenum.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and urine output closely.
2. Maintain excellent IV access and keep the patient hydrated with LR.
3. Monitor the patient's CVP and goal CVP 8-12.
4. Trend Hct Q8h and transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
5. Keep INR < 1.5, Plts > 50, and f'gen > 100.
6. Utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no lactic acidosis or AG).
7. Consider bicarb/mucomyst for management of metabolic acidosis.
8. Monitor the patient's abdominal exam, lactates, films for free air, and surgical follow-up for potential bowel necrosis.
9. Defer tissue diagnosis of the retroperitoneal mass until more medically stable.
10. Consider prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an oliguric patient with a urine output ranging from 15-50ml/hour, with the most recent reading being 50ml/hour.
* The patient's hematocrit has decreased to 24.7%, and they are being transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
* The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500ml and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.
* The patient's blood pressure is 109/62mmHg, with a heart rate of 100bpm and a temperature of 37.3°C.
* The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 30% FiO2.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Oliguria: The patient's low urine output may indicate acute kidney injury or sepsis, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
* Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit may indicate ongoing bleeding or hemolysis, which can lead to cardiovascular instability and increased risk of infections.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to ventilator-associated lung injury and prolonged hospital stay.
* Sepsis: The patient's oliguria and decreased hematocrit may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, cardiovascular instability, and increased risk of mortality.
* Bloodstream infection: The patient's arterial line and multi-lumen catheters may increase the risk of bloodstream infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobility and presence of central lines may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular complications.

**Recommendations:**

* Monitor the patient's urine output and hematocrit closely to detect any changes or deterioration.
* Consider adjusting the patient's fluid management to optimize urine output and prevent fluid overload.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
* Consider performing a thorough sepsis evaluation, including blood cultures and imaging studies, to identify the source of the patient's sepsis.
* Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic therapy based on the results of the sepsis evaluation.
* Monitor the patient's central lines for signs of infection and consider removing them if necessary.
* Consider initiating prophylactic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis."

   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also [**Last Name (LF) 12449**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - Repeat hct 29.6 at 9am (Hct 24.7 at 2am)
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Note thyroid nodules on problem list as above; updated D/C ppwk
   - TSH added on returned 1.9
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also [**Last Name (LF) 12449**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - Repeat hct 29.6 at 9am (Hct 24.7 at 2am)
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Note thyroid nodules on problem list as above; updated D/C ppwk
   - TSH added on returned 1.9
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a retroperitoneal bleed and pseudoaneurysm. The patient had a history of trauma, pancreatitis, and duodenal ulceration/inflammation, which may have contributed to the development of the pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on invasive ventilation with a standby mode and is receiving 50% oxygen.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypertension and tachycardia, which may be related to pain. Metoprolol was started to control blood pressure.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed and pseudoaneurysm, which may be causing abdominal pain. The patient is receiving morphine and dilaudid for pain management.
* Neurological: The patient's mental status is altered, and she is not able to respond to commands.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal compromise, as evidenced by a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.
* Hematological: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.2 g/dL, and her platelet count is 124 K/uL.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's retroperitoneal bleed and pseudoaneurysm may increase the risk of sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's retroperitoneal bleed and pseudoaneurysm may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal compromise may worsen, leading to renal failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to neurological complications such as seizures or coma.

In terms of the patient's plan of care, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue invasive ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
* Continue to manage the patient's pain with morphine and dilaudid.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust metoprolol as needed.
* Monitor the patient's renal status and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider intubation if necessary.
* Consider performing an EGD to evaluate the patient's stomach for lymphoma involvement.
* Consider performing an ultrasound to evaluate the patient's thyroid nodules.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her clinical status."

   CT Abdomen ([**4-19**])
   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation
   posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
   Etiology of
   this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to prior trauma,
   pancreatitis or
   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident
   Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and the patient
   was
   referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression
   by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be evaluated
   during
   angiography.
   3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm,
   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also nauseous, will try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, leading to hypotension and hemorrhagic shock. The patient has undergone coiling by interventional radiology to stop the hemorrhage, and labs are improving, including a decrease in metabolic acidosis and lactate levels, and an improvement in blood pressure.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, with a SpO2 of 97% on room air. She has a history of respiratory failure, which is being monitored closely. The patient's urine output has been poor, likely due to acute renal failure, and she is at risk for further kidney damage from contrast administration.

The patient has a history of shock, hypotension, and hemorrhagic shock, which has led to a diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock. The patient's CVP is being monitored, and she is being resuscitated with IV fluids. The patient's INR is being monitored, and she is being treated with blood products as needed.

The patient has a history of pancreatitis, and the differential diagnosis for the retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman disease. The patient's GI tract is being evaluated with an EGD to rule out acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's CVP is being monitored, and she is being resuscitated with IV fluids.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output has been poor, and she is at risk for further kidney damage from contrast administration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is being monitored closely.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is being treated with bicarbonate and other supportive measures.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is being monitored, and she is being kept normothermic.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is being monitored, and she is being treated with antibiotics as needed.

The patient's surgical complications include:

1. Retroperitoneal mass: The patient's retroperitoneal mass is being evaluated with imaging studies and surgical consultation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which is being monitored closely.
3. Duodenal ulcer: The patient's duodenal ulcer is being evaluated with an EGD to rule out acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.

The patient's medications include:

1. Morphine: The patient is receiving morphine for pain management.
2. Dilaudid: The patient is receiving dilaudid for pain management.
3. Metoprolol: The patient is receiving metoprolol for blood pressure control.
4. Fentanyl: The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management.
5. Propofol: The patient is receiving propofol for sedation.
6. Pantoprazole: The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
7. Hydromorphone: The patient is receiving hydromorphone for pain management.

The patient's laboratory results include:

1. Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
2. Platelet count: 124 K/uL
3. White blood cell count: 11.2 K/uL
4. Blood urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
5. Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
6. Glucose: 107 mg/dL
7. Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
8. Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
9. Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
10. Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 1.9 mIU/mL

The patient's imaging studies include:

1. CT abdomen/pelvis: The patient has undergone a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed an extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas, suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
2. Angiography: The patient has undergone angiography, which showed marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to compression by the large hematoma.
3. Abdominal ultrasound: The patient has undergone an abdominal ultrasound, which showed a large pseudoaneurysm posterior to the pancreas.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Further evaluation of the retroperitoneal mass with imaging studies and surgical consultation.
3. Management of the patient's acute renal failure with fluid resuscitation and supportive measures.
4. Treatment of the patient's respiratory failure with invasive ventilation and supportive measures.
5. Management of the patient's metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate and other supportive measures.
6. Monitoring of the patient's temperature and blood pressure.
7. Further evaluation of the patient's GI tract with an EGD to rule out acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.
8. Consideration of antibiotics for the patient's leukocytosis."

   CT Abdomen ([**4-19**])
   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation
   posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
   Etiology of
   this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to prior trauma,
   pancreatitis or
   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident
   Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and the patient
   was
   referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression
   by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be evaluated
   during
   angiography.
   3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm,
   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours. Hemodynamically stable.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access
 good PIV access now; will plan to pull
   old CVL from OSH.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   - No longer necessary to trend bladder pressures
   - Change to PO Dilaudid for pain control
   - F/U CT in [**3-21**] weeks
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD eventually to rule out
   acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   - F/U abdominal US done this morning
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.  Resolved.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO - ADAT, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed
   recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PO PPI
   # Access: Right IJ (may pull today), peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

   CT Abdomen ([**4-19**])
   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation
   posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
   Etiology of
   this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to prior trauma,
   pancreatitis or
   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident
   Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and the patient
   was
   referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression
   by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be evaluated
   during
   angiography.
   3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm,
   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours. Hemodynamically stable.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access
 good PIV access now; will plan to pull
   old CVL from OSH.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   - No longer necessary to trend bladder pressures
   - Change to PO Dilaudid for pain control
   - F/U CT in [**3-21**] weeks
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD eventually to rule out
   acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   - F/U abdominal US done this morning
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.  Resolved.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO - ADAT, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed
   recs.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, leading to hypotension and hemorrhagic shock. She underwent coiling by interventional radiology to stop the hemorrhage, and her labs are improving. She is currently hemodynamically stable, but has poor urine output, which is a concern. She also has respiratory failure, which was treated with intubation and ventilation, but was extubated and is now oxygenating and ventilating well on room air. She has a history of pancreatitis and duodenal ulceration/inflammation, which may be related to the etiology of the pseudoaneurysm. She also has thyroid nodules, which are being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding from the retroperitoneal mass, which could lead to hemorrhagic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's low urine output could progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis could worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, given her respiratory failure and recent intubation.
6. Sepsis: The patient's inflammatory response could worsen, leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of pancreatitis could lead to further pancreatic damage and complications.
8. Duodenal Ulceration/Inflammation: The patient's history of duodenal ulceration/inflammation could lead to further complications, including bleeding and perforation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and labs closely, particularly her urine output, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels.
2. Maintain excellent IV access and continue to resuscitate with fluids as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation and oxygenation as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
5. Consider bicarb and mucomyst to manage metabolic acidosis.
6. Monitor the patient's temperature and consider antipyretics if necessary.
7. Consider antibiotics if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of infection.
8. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and consider thyroid ultrasound if necessary.
9. Consider further imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, to further evaluate the retroperitoneal mass and its relationship to the patient's symptoms.
10. Consider consultation with a gastroenterologist to further evaluate the patient's history of pancreatitis and duodenal ulceration/inflammation."
