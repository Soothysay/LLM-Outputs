   right
   lower lobe (2, 31-40). There is a nodular subpleural opacity within the
   periphery of the right lower lobe (2, 40) which may represent a small
   pulmonary infarct. Filling defects within the left upper lobe segmental
   arteries (2, 19), lingula (2, 24), and left lower lobe (2, 36)
   segmental
   arteries are also identified. There is no axillary, hilar, or
   mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a small
   left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of bowing of the
   interventricular
   septum to suggest right heart failure at this time.
   Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - LENIs to help determine if large lower extremity clot burden, which
   may require IVC filter if too much uterine bleeding with full
   anticoagulation
   - TTE to assess for any right heart strain in setting of large
   bilateral pulmonary embolism
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly
   #. Uterine bleeding:
   -Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5 days leading up to
   presentation to the hospital. Denies lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   - f/u OB/Gyn recsto assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding
   persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can consider a course
   medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the endometrium
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Two large bore IVs
   #. Anemia: Currently her HCT is stable.
   - Ferrous gluconate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, who presented with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with extensive bilateral PE and possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct.

The patient is currently receiving heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and is being considered for warfarin therapy. A CT angiogram (CTA) showed bilateral PE without evidence of right heart strain, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed T-wave inversion in lead III.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 9.0 g/dL, and her hematocrit (Hct) is 30.8%. The patient is currently taking ferrous gluconate 325 mg and is being monitored for anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 131/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.8 K/uL
* Platelet count (Plt): 251 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 102 mg/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 9.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show bilateral PE with possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct, and no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pulmonary infarction or hemorrhage
* Right heart strain or failure
* Hemorrhagic complications from anticoagulation therapy
* Uterine bleeding or anemia
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence
* Infection or sepsis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiating warfarin therapy when stability is assured
* Monitoring for anemia and uterine bleeding
* Considering a course of medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the endometrium
* Maintaining active type and screen
* Two large bore IVs
* Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting of full anticoagulation"

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. She has a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding and has been experiencing pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She was started on heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and warfarin is being initiated when stability is more assured. The patient's uterine bleeding has been increasing, and she received Lupron on 11/28. The OB/Gyn team is assisting in managing the uterine bleeding while on full anticoagulation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/87 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -156 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 251 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L and a sodium level of 136 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, with multiple filling defects in the pulmonary arteries supplying the right upper and lower lobes, and the left upper and lower lobes. There is also a small left pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary infarction: The patient's imaging studies show a possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct, which could lead to further complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.
2. Uterine bleeding: The patient's uterine bleeding is increasing, and she is at risk of heavy bleeding while on full anticoagulation. This could lead to hypovolemic shock or anemia.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pulmonary emboli could lead to respiratory failure, which would require mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's bilateral pulmonary emboli could also lead to cardiac complications such as right heart strain or pulmonary hypertension.
6. Infection: The patient's pulmonary emboli could increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy could increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of uterine bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at risk of several medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). She has been experiencing significant bleeding, with episodes of heavy bleeding requiring transfusions of blood products. Her laboratory results show a decreasing hemoglobin level, with a current value of 25.6 g/dL. She has also developed borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either lower extremity.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/80 mmHg. She is receiving heparin sodium infusion and has a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. Her respiratory support includes an ABG of 20 mmHg.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's unstable condition and inability to assess certain areas. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.8 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 234 x 10^9/L, and blood urea nitrogen of 9 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, nutrition via a regular diet, and glycemic control. She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer, as well as treatment for pain control and bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's significant bleeding and decreasing hemoglobin level may lead to hemorrhagic shock, which can be life-threatening.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension may worsen over time, leading to pulmonary hypertension and potential cardiac complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: Despite the patient's normal lower extremity ultrasound, she may still be at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's decreased immune function and presence of indwelling lines and drains may increase her risk of developing an infection, which could worsen her condition.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and potential cardiac complications may lead to cardiovascular events, such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction."

   Assessment and Plan
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.  LENIs negative and TTE with no signs of right heart
   strain.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly and
   possibility of procedures this admission
   #. Uterine bleeding: Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5
   days leading up to presentation to the hospital. Denies
   lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   - f/u OB/Gyn recs to assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can
   consider a course medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the
   endometrium
   -F/u Ob/Gyn decision re myomect vs uterine artery embolization and
   timing
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation -> next Hct due 11 am because AM labs drawn
   right after transfusion
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Two large bore Ivs
   #. Anemia: Currently her HCT is stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, who presented with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She was found to have extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA) without evidence of right heart strain.

The patient has been experiencing uterine bleeding, which has increased in the 4-5 days leading up to her hospital admission. She has been receiving treatment with Lupron and has been anticoagulated with heparin drip.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 129/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 30 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination is notable for bilateral chest pain, but there is no jugular venous distension, and her lung fields are clear.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, a hematocrit of 25.6%, and a platelet count of 234 K/uL. Her blood glucose is 102 mg/dL, and her electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's ultrasound examination showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in either lower extremity. Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >55%, borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no signs of right heart strain.

The patient's bleeding has been managed with transfusions, and she has been anticoagulated with heparin drip. Her uterus is being monitored with telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to ensure no brisk bleeding occurs while she is on full anticoagulation.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for now, with possible callout later this day.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding has been managed with transfusions, but there is a risk of further bleeding complications, particularly with the use of anticoagulation therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has extensive bilateral PE, which can lead to further complications, such as right heart strain, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she continues to bleed or if her underlying condition is not adequately managed.
4. Uterine bleeding: The patient's uterine bleeding may persist or worsen, particularly if her anticoagulation therapy is not adjusted properly.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the setting of her anticoagulation therapy and her recent hospitalization.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and borderline pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias."

   Microbiology: None
   Assessment and Plan
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.  LENIs negative and TTE with no signs of right heart
   strain.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly and
   possibility of procedures this admission
   #. Uterine bleeding: Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5
   days leading up to presentation to the hospital. Denies
   lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   - f/u OB/Gyn recs to assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can
   consider a course medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the
   endometrium
   - Per Ob/Gyn would like to avoid procedure such as myomectomy or UAE;
   will not pursue unless patient transfusion resistant and unable to
   maintain Hct > 25.
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation -> next Hct due 11 am because AM labs drawn
   right after transfusion
   - Maintain active type and screen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, who presented with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She has been experiencing heavy vaginal bleeding, and her hematocrit (Hct) has been unstable, dropping from 28.4 to 25.6. She has been transfused with one unit of blood and is receiving heparin drips for systemic anticoagulation. The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being managed with heparin and warfarin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's Hct is still dropping, and she is at risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and there is a risk of further embolization, which could lead to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen if she continues to bleed, which could lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Blood transfusion reactions: The patient has received one unit of blood, and there is a risk of transfusion reactions, such as hemolytic reactions or allergic reactions.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
6. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of PE, and there is a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her legs.
7. Right heart strain: The patient's PE could lead to right heart strain, which could worsen her condition and increase her risk of mortality.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's PE could lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or heart failure.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's PE could lead to respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pneumothorax.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

Given the patient's unstable condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her therapy as needed to prevent complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute, secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding. She has a history of anemia and was recently treated with Lupron for uterine bleeding. The patient is currently receiving heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and warfarin is planned to be initiated when stability is more assured.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/80 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her hemodynamic monitoring shows a balance of 414 mL of fluid in and 650 mL out.

The patient's laboratory results show a hematocrit of 28.3%, with a platelet count of 53,000/μL. Her white blood cell count is 5.8, and her creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient has been prescribed ferrous gluconate 325 mg daily for iron deficiency anemia, and she is receiving heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis. She is also receiving H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis and naproxen, tylenol, and oxycodone for pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications due to full anticoagulation therapy.
2. Iron deficiency anemia exacerbation due to prolonged bleeding.
3. Pulmonary embolism progression or recurrent embolism.
4. Right heart strain or failure due to extensive bilateral PE.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Infection or sepsis due to indwelling catheters or invasive procedures.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to electrolyte imbalance or medication interactions.
8. Respiratory failure or hypoxemia due to pulmonary embolism or respiratory infection.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently being managed in the ICU with plans to transition to a gynecology service once her condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding and presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/80 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.3%, and platelet count of 53,000/μL. Her white blood cell count is 5.8 x 10^9/L, and her creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving heparin infusion for systemic anticoagulation and is scheduled to start warfarin when stability is more assured. She is also receiving ferrous gluconate for iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's medical history includes a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, and she has received Lupron for uterine bleeding. The patient is currently being managed with a combination of medications, including naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone for pain control, as well as bowel regimen with senna and colace.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
2. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding. The patient's history of anemia and iron deficiency anemia may also increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Uterine bleeding: The patient's history of uterine fibroid bleeding and the use of Lupron may increase the risk of uterine bleeding.
4. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia may worsen if she does not receive adequate iron supplementation.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts, due to her underlying medical condition and the use of invasive devices.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's pulmonary embolism may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary embolism may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage potential complications."
