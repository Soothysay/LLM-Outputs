   - Insulin gtt started at 10, then to 15 with two boluses of 10 units.
   - Added lyspro 10 units after gtt off
   - Urine output briefly fell to 15 mL/hr, so bloused 500 cc NS.
   - On the floor gave 2 L NS, then 1 L 40 mEq KCl in [**11-28**] NS, then 500 cc
   NS, then 1 L 40 mEq KCl in [**11-28**] NS
   - Was agitated in context of moving him and re-dressing IJ (despite
   propofol infusion at 80 with 30 bolus). Continued to struggle,
   therefore switched to Fent. Versed from propofol.
   - Placed [**Name (NI) 1950**]
   - Friend [**Name (NI) 12259**] called around 20:00 to ask about how he is doing - by
   that stage K WNLs and glucose in 200s.
   - Has been combative overnight, so Versed increased around 5 a.m. from
   6 to 8.

   Microbiology: None.
   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12301**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated today but remains disoriented and agitated
   Diabetic ketoacidosis resolved
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue supportive care and re-institute cardiac medications
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was also
   dramatically hyperkalemic and hyperglycemic on presentation.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiologies include infarctive, related to electrolyte disturbance
   (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), toxic (accidental versus intentional).
   Infarction unlikely given enzyems, atypical for electrolyte
   disturbance, more likely toxic. Prolonged QRS could relate to either
   toxicity, particularly with tricyclics, but may also results from
   hyperkalemia. Patient takes metoprolol at home, is somewhat erratic
   with medications and did not respond to atropine. Concerning for
   beta-blocker overdose, toxic and ischemic. UTox and STox panels
   negative (including for ASA).
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction as above
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below)
   - Toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Coming down with correction of hyperglycemia. Insulin, calcium chloride
   in ED, as above. Unclear cause: S/p infarcted tissue worth considering,
   but lactate 3.0. Tumor lysis unlikely based on normal CBC, but need to
   check LDH. Toxicology clear.
   - Continue insulin IV drip (started at 10, gave another 20 bolus and
   running at 15 now).
   - Will give Kayexelate later
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (50%, 550 cc, 22 BPM, PEEP 8 cm
   H2O).
   - Continue until stable lab values, then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes q8h
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Repeat echo when improved
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension appears out of proportion to
   bradycardia. Now paced and hypertensive. Will allow to be slightly
   hypertensive at present, given that we do not know typical range (but
   likely has untreated hypertension). Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk
   of cerebral hypoperfusion in this patient.
   - Presently elevated with pacing and depressed slightly by vent and
   sedation.
   - Follow and re-titrate medications.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. Likely role in above. Hemoglobin glycosylation is
   time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor control and chronicity more
   than this acute event.
   - Continue IV insulin until WNLs
   - Then order ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Insulin gtt started at 10, then to 15 with two boluses of 10 units.
   - Added lyspro 10 units after gtt off
   - Urine output briefly fell to 15 mL/hr, so bloused 500 cc NS.

   - Was agitated in context of moving him and re-dressing IJ (despite
   propofol infusion at 80 with 30 bolus). Continued to struggle,
   therefore switched to Fent. Versed from propofol.
   - Placed [**Name (NI) 1950**]

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was also
   dramatically hyperkalemic and hyperglycemic on presentation.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiologies include infarctive, related to electrolyte disturbance
   (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), toxic (accidental versus intentional).
   Infarction unlikely given enzyems, atypical for electrolyte
   disturbance, more likely toxic. Prolonged QRS could relate to either
   toxicity, particularly with tricyclics, but may also results from
   hyperkalemia. Patient takes metoprolol at home, is somewhat erratic
   with medications and did not respond to atropine. Concerning for
   beta-blocker overdose, toxic and ischemic. UTox and STox panels
   negative (including for ASA).
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction as above
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below)
   - Toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Coming down with correction of hyperglycemia. Insulin, calcium chloride
   in ED, as above. Unclear cause: S/p infarcted tissue worth considering,
   but lactate 3.0. Tumor lysis unlikely based on normal CBC, but need to
   check LDH. Toxicology clear.
   - Continue insulin IV drip (started at 10, gave another 20 bolus and
   running at 15 now).
   - Will give Kayexelate later
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (50%, 550 cc, 22 BPM, PEEP 8 cm
   H2O).
   - Continue until stable lab values, then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes q8h
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Repeat echo when improved
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension appears out of proportion to
   bradycardia. Now paced and hypertensive. Will allow to be slightly
   hypertensive at present, given that we do not know typical range (but
   likely has untreated hypertension). Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk
   of cerebral hypoperfusion in this patient.
   - Presently elevated with pacing and depressed slightly by vent and
   sedation.
   - Follow and re-titrate medications.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. Likely role in above. Hemoglobin glycosylation is
   time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor control and chronicity more
   than this acute event.
   - Continue IV insulin until WNLs
   - Then order ISS
   - A1c
   - Fluids - now 1.5 L
   - When K below 5.3 will start 40 mEq L 1/2 NS.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), complete heart block, hyperkalemia, and non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. He was also found to have coronary artery disease, hypertension, and acute renal failure. The patient was intubated and sedated, and was placed on a ventilator. He was also receiving insulin, calcium chloride, and other medications to manage his condition.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Complete heart block: May require pacing or implantation of a permanent pacemaker.
	* Ischemia/infarction: May occur due to the patient's coronary artery disease and poor perfusion.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia: May develop due to the patient's intubation and sedation.
	* Respiratory failure: May occur if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): May develop due to the patient's acute renal failure.
	* Chronic kidney disease: May worsen due to the patient's poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension.
4. Neurological complications:
	* Cerebral edema: May develop due to the patient's hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar state.
	* Seizures: May occur due to the patient's electrolyte disturbances and hyperglycemia.
5. Infectious complications:
	* Sepsis: May develop due to the patient's immunosuppression and presence of central lines.
	* Pneumonia: May develop due to the patient's intubation and sedation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   NS, then 1 L 40 mEq KCl in [**11-28**] NS
   - Was agitated in context of moving him and re-dressing IJ (despite
   propofol infusion at 80 with 30 bolus). Continued to struggle,
   therefore switched to Fent. Versed from propofol.
   - Placed [**Name (NI) 1950**]

   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94 kg male who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He was in a hyperosmolar, likely non-ketotic hyperglycemic state, which likely caused dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, resulting in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension, and his collapse.

The patient has been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), complete heart block, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a temporary epicardial pacing wire in place.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
	* Cardiac arrest
	* Myocardial infarction
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia
	* Respiratory failure
	* Pulmonary edema
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
	* Chronic kidney disease
	* End-stage renal disease
4. Endocrine complications:
	* Hypoglycemia
	* Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome
5. Infections:
	* Sepsis
	* Bacteremia
	* Pneumonia
6. Neurological complications:
	* Cerebral edema
	* Cerebral hypoperfusion
	* Seizures
7. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding
	* Pancreatitis
	* Small intestine obstruction
8. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia
	* Leukopenia
	* Thrombocytopenia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient was admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of dizziness, chest pain, and heart block. The patient was on invasive ventilation and had a fever of 101.8°F. The patient was found to have hyperkalemia, which led to the decision to restart HCTZ and withhold lisinopril. The patient was also found to have agitation, which was managed with valium and haldol.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 120/89 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation has been 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatinine, and lactate, indicating potential cardiac and renal damage. The patient's white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show mild pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion on chest X-ray, indicating potential cardiac and respiratory complications.

The patient's microbiology results are pending, with cultures taken from the blood, urine, and MRSA screen.

The patient's assessment and plan include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), bradycardia, and ICU care. The patient is being managed with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of heart block and bradycardia puts them at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion may indicate underlying respiratory failure, which can worsen if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not treated promptly.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which can worsen if not managed properly.
5. DKA: The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as acidosis, coma, and even death.

In conclusion, the patient's health progress in the ICU is stable, but they require close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative, does not [**Doctor Last Name 12312**] out as pt risk given being [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 12313**]ion given fever, CXR, U/A, blood cx NGTD.
   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative, does not [**Doctor Last Name 12312**] out as pt risk given being [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 12313**]ion given fever, CXR, U/A, blood cx NGTD.
   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiovascular complications:
	* Complete heart block: The patient's heart block is likely related to electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyperkalemia. Pacing transvenously with a lower threshold in sinus rhythm is necessary to maintain a stable heart rhythm.
	* Ischemic etiology: The patient has two-vessel coronary artery disease, which may have contributed to the development of complete heart block. Further evaluation with telemetry, 12-lead EKG, and cycle enzymes is necessary to rule out ischemic etiology.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's fever and chest pain may indicate pneumonia, which needs to be ruled out with further evaluation, such as a chest CT scan or bronchoscopy.
	* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but further weaning of sedation and extubation may be necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.7 to 1.5, indicating acute kidney injury. Further evaluation with urine osmolality and microscopy for signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is necessary.
	* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's A1c level suggests chronic high hyperglycemia, which may have contributed to the development of chronic kidney disease.
4. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is currently under control, but further monitoring is necessary to prevent hyperglycemia-related complications.
	* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is currently under control, but further monitoring is necessary to prevent hyperkalemia-related complications.
5. Infection-related complications:
	* Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine culture is pending, and further evaluation is necessary to rule out urinary tract infection.
	* Bloodstream infection: The patient's blood culture is pending, and further evaluation is necessary to rule out bloodstream infection.
6. Nutritional complications:
	* Malnutrition: The patient's recent history of poor nutrition and malnutrition may have contributed to the development of hyperglycemia and other complications.
7. Psychological complications:
	* Anxiety and agitation: The patient's recent history of anxiety and agitation may be related to withdrawal from benzodiazepines or other substances.

To prevent or manage these potential complications, the following interventions are necessary:

1. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and medical devices.
2. Correction of electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia.
3. Further evaluation of the patient's cardiac status, including telemetry, 12-lead EKG, and cycle enzymes.
4. Management of respiratory status, including weaning of sedation and extubation.
5. Evaluation and management of renal status, including urine osmolality and microscopy for signs of ATN.
6. Monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy as necessary.
7. Further evaluation of the patient's nutritional status and provision of adequate nutrition.
8. Management of anxiety and agitation, including psychological consultation and pharmacological interventions as necessary."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative, does not [**Doctor Last Name 12312**] out as pt risk given being [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 12313**]ion given fever, CXR, U/A, blood cx NGTD.
   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with a complex medical condition, including:

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of type II diabetes and has developed hyperglycemia, which has likely caused the development of complete heart block and hypotension.
2. Complete Heart Block: The patient has developed complete heart block, which is likely caused by electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyperkalemia.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which are likely secondary to acute on chronic hyperglycemia.
4. Respiratory Status: The patient is sedated and intubated due to combativeness in the emergency department. The indication for intubation is resolving, and the plan is to wean sedation and extubate when stable lab values are achieved.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has two-vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology is possible, particularly if the sinus node is infarcted.
6. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 120/89 mmHg. The plan is to aim for a blood pressure of >110 mmHg, given the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion.
7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. The plan is to follow urine osmolality and electrolytes and perform microscopy for signs of acute tubular necrosis.
8. Diabetes/Non-ketotic Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State: The patient has developed a hyperosmolar state, with an osmolality of 326 mOsm. The plan is to continue adjusting standing insulin and use an insulin sliding scale to manage blood glucose levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's complete heart block and hyperkalemia increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the plan to wean sedation and extubate is not successful.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts, given the use of antibiotics and the presence of a urinary catheter.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of developing hypoglycemia if the insulin sliding scale is not adjusted properly or if the patient's blood glucose levels become too low.
6. Cerebral edema: The patient's hyperosmolar state increases the risk of cerebral edema, particularly if the blood glucose levels are not controlled properly.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, or renal failure. The plan to wean sedation and extubate should be carefully implemented, and the patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, and the patient should be educated on proper insulin management and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.
   Consider infection given fever, specifically community acquired PNA as
   pt with aspiration risk and making purulent sputum. CNS infection on
   the ddx, however pt unable to cooperate for LP. Brain stem infarction
   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.

   pt with aspiration risk and making purulent sputum. CNS infection on
   the ddx, however pt unable to cooperate for LP. Brain stem infarction
   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with chest pain, dizziness, and cardiac arrest. He was found to have complete heart block and was intubated. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He was given heparin prophylaxis and was started on antibiotics for a possible infection. He was also given labetalol and metoprolol for hypertension and tachycardia. He was sedated with valium and haldol for agitation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 101.8°F, HR 99 bpm, BP 120/89 mmHg, RR 20 breaths/min, SpO2 97%
* Physical examination: The patient is sedated and has restraints on his arms and legs. He is trying to remove his clothing. His abdomen is soft and non-tender.
* Lab results: The patient's blood cultures are pending, but he has a mild elevation in his white blood cell count and a mild thrombocytopenia. His creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are elevated, but his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.
* Imaging: The patient's chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications:

* Infection: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics, which may indicate a bacterial infection. However, the culture results are pending, and the patient's condition may change.
* Heart block: The patient has a history of complete heart block, which may be related to his hyperkalemia. He may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent recurrent episodes.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is on medication to control it. He may require further treatment to manage his blood pressure.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a mild thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his underlying condition or his medications. He may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent bleeding complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury. He may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further kidney damage.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics, which may indicate a septic episode. He may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further complications.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of complete heart block and may be at risk for other cardiac arrhythmias. He may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's condition is stable, but he requires further monitoring and treatment to manage his underlying conditions and prevent complications.
* He should be continued on antibiotics for a possible infection, and his blood cultures should be monitored for results.
* He should be continued on labetalol and metoprolol for hypertension and tachycardia, and his blood pressure should be monitored regularly.
* He should be continued on valium and haldol for agitation, and his mental status should be monitored regularly.
* He should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count.
* He should be monitored for signs of cardiac arrhythmias, such as palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
* He should be monitored for signs of renal failure, such as decreased urine output, increased creatinine, and increased blood urea nitrogen.
* He should be monitored for signs of sepsis, such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count.
* He should be considered for further treatment, such as antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, depending on the results of his blood cultures and other lab tests."

   Patchy LLL opacity on wetread and with fever and purulent sputum would
   be concerned for CAP. Periintubation. Poor inspiratory film. No
   leukocytosis, but did have brief fever.. CXR possible fluid. Will
   follow closely. Clinical exam not consistent with PNA
 will follow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   # Altered mental status:
   Vastly improved today. Likely encephalopathy from sedation (occurs in
   30%^ patients with intubation and sedation). Appears not to have
   sustained hypoxic injury
 impression based on exam. Mental status will
   likely continue to improve.
   - Minimize psychotropics
 stop Haldol and continue on PRN basis only
   - Stop CIWA
   - Haldol for intractable agitation, with caution
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc
   # CAP:
   Patchy LLL opacity on wetread and with fever and purulent sputum would
   be concerned for CAP. Periintubation. Poor inspiratory film. No
   leukocytosis, but did have brief fever.. CXR possible fluid. Will
   follow closely. Clinical exam not consistent with PNA
 will follow
   closely. Nonetheless, will continue Rx for CAP.
   - F/u CXR final read
   - Continue azithromycin
   - Switch ceftriaxone to cefpodoxime.
   - F/u sputum cx
   Thrombocytopenia: Mild, possibly secondary to HSC vs acute infection
   per above.
   - Monitor platelets
   - If continues to fall will DC sub cutaneous heparin
   # Complete heart block. Resolved. Most likely in the setting of
   hyperkalemia, which can cause AV blocks.

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   # Altered mental status:
   Vastly improved today. Likely encephalopathy from sedation (occurs in
   30%^ patients with intubation and sedation). Appears not to have
   sustained hypoxic injury
 impression based on exam. Mental status will
   likely continue to improve.
   - Minimize psychotropics
 stop Haldol and continue on PRN basis only
   - Stop CIWA
   - Haldol for intractable agitation, with caution
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive by EMS and was subsequently intubated and sedated. The patient's condition has improved significantly since admission, with his mental status improving and his fever resolving.

The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes. He was diagnosed with non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state, which was treated with insulin and fluids. He also had mild thrombocytopenia, which was likely secondary to his underlying medical condition.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of troponin-T, which suggested myocardial infarction. However, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) and enzyme levels did not support this diagnosis. The patient's complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count of 7.8, which was slightly elevated. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. His cardiac status is also stable, with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 172/91 mmHg.

The patient's medication regimen includes azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and heparin. He is also receiving insulin and fluids to manage his hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that could arise in this patient include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray showed patchy LLL opacity, which could be consistent with pneumonia. He is receiving antibiotics for this condition.
2. Heart block: The patient's EKG showed complete heart block, which is a potential complication of hyperkalemia. He will need to be monitored closely for any signs of heart block recurrence.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is mildly low, which could increase his risk of bleeding. He will need to be monitored closely for any signs of bleeding.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are still elevated, which could increase his risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which could indicate acute renal failure. He will need to be monitored closely for any signs of worsening renal function.

Overall, the patient's condition has improved significantly since admission, but he still requires close monitoring and management of his underlying medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He was in a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemic state, which likely resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, leading to heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension, and collapse.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.5°F, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 172/91 mmHg, respiratory rate 26 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 97%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 7.8 x 10^9/L, Hct 35.5%, platelet count 148 x 10^9/L, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, troponin T 0.04 ng/mL, and glucose 103 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is an overweight male with agitation, but also sedated, with restraints in place. He is trying to remove his clothing. His cardiovascular examination is normal, and his lung examination is unlabored.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and the differential diagnosis includes infection, particularly community-acquired pneumonia, as well as brain stem infarction. A lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered if the patient's mental status does not improve and he is able to cooperate.
2. Complete heart block: The patient's complete heart block is likely related to hyperkalemia, which can cause AV blocks. The patient's EKG and enzymes are not consistent with infarction, and the differential diagnosis includes infarctive heart block.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is mild and may be secondary to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state or acute infection.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia has resolved.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is stable, and he is being treated with aspirin and a statin.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is acute and is being treated with labetalol.
8. Diabetes/non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state: The patient's hyperglycemia has resolved for now.
9. Acute respiratory failure: The patient does not have acute respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of his mental status and vital signs.
2. Consideration of a lumbar puncture (LP) if his mental status does not improve and he is able to cooperate.

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

   Vastly improved today. Likely encephalopathy from sedation (occurs in
   30%^ patients with intubation and sedation). Appears not to have
   sustained hypoxic injury

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented to the ICU after experiencing chest pain, bradycardia, and hypotension. He was found to have complete heart block and was diagnosed with a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemic state, likely causing hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, which led to his heart block and collapse. He was treated with antibiotics and other medications, and his condition has improved. He remains intubated and sedated, and his mental status is improving. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes, and is at risk for acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebound hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia has resolved, but there is a risk of rebound hyperkalemia if the underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Worsening of diabetes: The patient's diabetes is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of worsening hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis if his treatment plan is not adjusted.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has had an episode of acute renal failure, and there is a risk of recurrent episodes if his treatment plan is not adjusted.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's complete heart block has resolved, but there is a risk of recurrent episodes if his underlying cardiovascular disease is not addressed.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, and there is a risk of developing a new infection while he is in the ICU.
6. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, and there is a risk of developing delirium again while he is in the ICU.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing pneumonia again while he is in the ICU.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis while he is in the ICU, especially if he is immobile for an extended period.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing a stress ulcer while he is in the ICU, especially if he is not receiving adequate treatment for his underlying conditions.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia while he is in the ICU, especially if he is not receiving adequate treatment for his underlying conditions."
