   Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Tried to wean dopamine but patient
s blood pressure wouldn
t tolerate
   weaning
   - Gave fluids with bicarb x 1L in D5W,  then restarted NS@75/hr
   - Didn't wake up enough to extubate during the day, changed to propofol
   and stopped all other sedating meds.
   - Changed briefly to PS because it seemed like he was waking up, but
   was only breathing 7-9 times per minute so put him back on CMV in the
   afternoon. Repeat ABG showed 7.23/46/107/20, so increased RR from 12 to
   14.
   - Did SBT without sedation at 4am and he did well, woke up and was
   following some commands although still somewhat somnolent off
   sedation.  Decided to resedate with propofol and reevaluate in the
   morning.

   Chest Xray from today in OMR
   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation and received IL-2 therapy. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is attributed to oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration. The patient's blood pressure is being supported with pressors, and he is at risk for hypotension due to recent IL-2 administration and possible sepsis.

The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which is likely related to IL-2 administration, but may also have a component of prerenal azotemia due to low blood pressures. He has leukocytosis, which may be due to IL-2 or underlying infection. The patient has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which may be related to adrenal insufficiency or tumor involvement of the adrenal glands.

Plan:

1. Continue to support blood pressure with pressors as needed.
2. Wean dopamine as tolerated, with preference for weaning propofol.
3. Attempt extubation with Precedex around noon today, overlapping propofol for 1-2 hours.
4. Consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse.
5. Follow-up sputum culture and gram stain, blood cultures, and urinalysis.
6. Monitor creatinine and urine output, and check pm lytes.
7. Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve.
8. Send infectious workup, including C. diff, and consider tumor involvement of the adrenal glands.
9. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Continue to monitor for signs of respiratory acidosis and nongap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue unless the underlying causes are addressed. Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation can lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension in the setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration make sepsis a possibility.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis if not managed properly.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hyponatremia and hyperkalemia may be related to adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death if not treated promptly.
5. Tumor progression: The patient's metastatic RCC may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life."

   Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Tried to wean dopamine but patient
s blood pressure wouldn
t tolerate
   weaning
   - Gave fluids with bicarb x 1L in D5W,  then restarted NS@75/hr
   - Didn't wake up enough to extubate during the day, changed to propofol
   and stopped all other sedating meds.
   - Changed briefly to PS because it seemed like he was waking up, but
   was only breathing 7-9 times per minute so put him back on CMV in the
   afternoon. Repeat ABG showed 7.23/46/107/20, so increased RR from 12 to
   14.
   - Did SBT without sedation at 4am and he did well, woke up and was
   following some commands although still somewhat somnolent off
   sedation.  Decided to resedate with propofol and try again this morning
   during rounds.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight
 will wean sedation again and retry spontaneous
   breathing trial with likely extubation this morning
   - Consider extubation to BiPap and may be difficult to extubate given
   body habitus and uncooperativeness at baseline
   - Continue propofol for sedation for now until extubation
   - Could consider steroids for cardiovascular collapse (would give
   high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not start to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Tried to wean dopamine but patient
s blood pressure wouldn
t tolerate
   weaning
   - Gave fluids with bicarb x 1L in D5W,  then restarted NS@75/hr
   - Didn't wake up enough to extubate during the day, changed to propofol
   and stopped all other sedating meds.
   - Changed briefly to PS because it seemed like he was waking up, but
   was only breathing 7-9 times per minute so put him back on CMV in the
   afternoon. Repeat ABG showed 7.23/46/107/20, so increased RR from 12 to
   14.
   - Did SBT without sedation at 4am and he did well, woke up and was
   following some commands although still somewhat somnolent off
   sedation.  Decided to resedate with propofol and try again this morning
   during rounds.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation and required pressor support due to IL-2 administration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
* Hypotension, likely due to recent IL-2 administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.
* Respiratory acidosis and non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to hypoventilation from benzodiazepine administration and body habitus, as well as some component of IL-2 treatment effect.
* Acute renal failure, likely related to IL-2 administration, but could have some component of prerenal azotemia in the setting of low blood pressures.
* Leukocytosis, likely due to IL-2, but may represent underlying infection.
* Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which have resolved with fluid administration and ventilatory support.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

* Pressors for MAP < 65, with plans to wean as tolerated.
* Propofol for sedation.
* IL-2 therapy.
* Fluid administration.
* Ventilatory support.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* ABG: pH 7.23, pCO2 46, pO2 107, HCO3- 20.
* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 22.9, Hct 41.7, Plt 372.
* Blood cultures: Pending.
* Urinalysis: Pending.
* Chest X-ray: Pending.

The patient's plan of care is as follows:

* Continue pressors for MAP < 65 and wean as tolerated.
* Wean sedation and attempt spontaneous breathing trial with extubation this morning.
* Consider extubation to BiPap and may be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness at baseline.
* Continue propofol for sedation until extubation.
* Consider steroids for cardiovascular collapse.
* FU sputum culture and gram stain.
* FU blood cultures x 2.
* FU urinalysis and culture.
* Support blood pressure as above.
* Monitor creatinine and urine output.
* Check pm lytes.
* Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not start to improve.
* Consider C Diff, although less likely given recent Abx exposure.

The patient's code status is full code, and ICU consent is signed. The patient's disposition is ICU for now."

   hypotension, renal failure (Cr peaked 7.3), erythroderm/flushing,
   psychosis. Hypercarbic resp failure ocurred morning of [**11-1**] in setting
   of ativan 2mg, renal failure, severe OSA.
   Major barrier to extubation remains mental status.
   IL-2 encephalopathy usually takes longer to improve than cardiovascular
   effect.
   Hypotension likely related to IL-2. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia,
   known effect of IL-2 but also at more risk for baceterial infection.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plan yesterday was to get benzos out of his system-- propofol at
   low-mod dose, maintain some fentanyl and try to d/c versed.  That was
   done, pt was on propofol only overnight and pt was evaluated off
   propofol. He was awake, agitated, but did not follow commands.
   Remains on dopamine and phenylephrine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and acute respiratory failure. He was admitted for IL-2 treatment, but developed major complications, including hypotension, renal failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated due to his mental status, which is a major barrier to extubation. His current medications include dopamine, phenylephrine, and propofol, and he is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and he may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to persist, and he may require ongoing dialysis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to continue, and he may require ongoing vasopressor support.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and eosinophilia, known effects of IL-2, increase his risk for bacterial infection.
5. Cardiovascular Collapse: The patient's hypotension and potential for bacterial infection increase his risk for cardiovascular collapse.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and potential for IL-2-induced encephalopathy increase his risk for neurological complications.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload and third spacing may lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure or respiratory distress.
8. Wound Infection: The patient's skin lesions and potential for bacterial infection increase his risk for wound infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status closely.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's medications, including dopamine and phenylephrine, to optimize his hemodynamic status.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
4. Continue to provide prophylactic antibiotics and monitor the patient's response.
5. Consider adding corticosteroids to the patient's regimen to reverse the effects of IL-2.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation regimen as necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to a wound care specialist to manage his skin lesions.
8. Continue to educate the patient's family on his condition and provide emotional support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: respiratory failure, hypotension
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with her
   note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   58 yo man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, OSA admitted for IL-2.
   Received last dose (6th dose) [**10-31**]. Major complications have included
   hypotension, renal failure (Cr peaked 7.3), erythroderm/flushing,
   psychosis. Hypercarbic resp failure ocurred morning of [**11-1**] in setting
   of ativan 2mg, renal failure, severe OSA.
   Major barrier to extubation remains mental status.
   IL-2 encephalopathy usually takes longer to improve than cardiovascular
   effect.
   Hypotension likely related to IL-2. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia,
   known effect of IL-2 but also at more risk for baceterial infection.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plan yesterday was to get benzos out of his system-- propofol at
   low-mod dose, maintain some fentanyl and try to d/c versed.  That was
   done, pt was on propofol only overnight and pt was evaluated off
   propofol. He was awake, agitated, but did not follow commands.
   Remains on dopamine and phenylephrine.
   Cr, bicarb improving.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and acute respiratory failure. He was admitted for IL-2 therapy, but has developed significant complications, including hypotension, renal failure, erythroderma/flushing, and psychosis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a major barrier to extubation being his mental status. He is sedated and unable to follow commands. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg. His respiratory support includes a CPAP/PPS ventilator mode, with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22.9 K/uL, with a significant eosinophilia of 30%. His creatinine level is improving, but remains elevated at 7.4 mg/dL. His lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L, and his calcium level is 7.3 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient has developed hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of ativan 2mg, renal failure, and severe OSA. A major barrier to extubation is his mental status.
2. Renal failure, acute: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely related to IL-2 therapy. His creatinine level is improving, but remains elevated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to IL-2 therapy, and he is at risk for bacterial infection due to leukocytosis and eosinophilia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacterial infection: The patient's leukocytosis and eosinophilia put him at risk for bacterial infection.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and inability to follow commands may be indicative of neurological complications, such as encephalopathy.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to respiratory arrest or require invasive ventilation.
5. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiovascular function. The patient's management should focus on addressing his respiratory failure, renal failure, and hypotension, while also preventing and managing potential complications."

   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Tmax: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* HR: 90 bpm (66-105)
* BP: 100/60 mmHg (68-144/38-86)
* RR: 18 insp/min (11-23)
* SpO2: 97%
* Heart rhythm: SR (sinus rhythm)

The patient's lab results are:

* WBC: 22.9, 22.3, 21.0
* Hct: 41.7, 36.2, 34.9
* Plt: 372, 346
* Cr: 7.8, 7.7, 7.4, 6.4, 5.5
* TCO2: 19, 20
* Glucose: 116, 101, 128, 94, 86
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition and medications include:

* Respiratory failure due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body habitus
* Hypotension due to IL-2 administration and possibly some contribution of intubation
* Acute renal failure due to IL-2 administration and possible prerenal azotemia
* Leukocytosis due to IL-2 and possible underlying infection
* Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia due to adrenal insufficiency and tumor involvement of the adrenal glands
* C Diff infection due to recent antibiotic exposure
* VAP due to intubation
* DVT due to immobility and SQ UF heparin
* Stress ulcer due to PPI
* Acute tubular necrosis due to IL-2 administration and possible prerenal azotemia

Based on the patient's condition and medications, it is recommended to:

* Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and medication levels
* Consider weaning dopamine and phenylephrine as tolerated
* Monitor the patient's creatinine and urine output and consider checking urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
* Consider sending infectious workup and C Diff testing
* Monitor the patient's electrolytes and consider adding on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
* Consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse and tumor involvement of the adrenal glands
* Continue to provide ventilatory support and consider extubation with Precedex around noon today
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adding on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis

   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   s/p extubation [**11-2**].
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Now stable off of pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.

   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect and
   diarrhea
   - gave bicarb 2 days ago with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 now 18)
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.  Now cdiff negative
   X1.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2 administration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Hypercarbic respiratory failure due to oversedation with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
* Hypotension: Now stable off of pressors, likely due to recent IL-2 administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.
* Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 administration, but could have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood pressures.
* Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying infection.
* Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Progression of hypercarbic respiratory failure, development of ARDS, or worsening of respiratory acidosis.
* Hypotension: Sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or vasopressor dependence.
* Acute renal failure: Worsening of kidney function, development of ATN, or need for dialysis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical in the ICU. The patient was successfully extubated but remained agitated, requiring continued use of precedex. Dopamine was stopped, and phenylephrine was weaned off and then restarted due to low blood pressure. The patient has a low-grade temperature and has received Ativan for agitation.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on 70% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 22.9, hemoglobin of 41.7, and platelet count of 372. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment.

The patient's microbiology results are pending, but the urine culture is negative, and the sputum culture shows sparse growth of commensal respiratory flora.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potential need for renal replacement therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress, leading to further hypoxia, hypercapnia, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ hypoperfusion, tissue hypoxia, and potential need for vasopressor support.
4. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperature and pending microbiology results suggest a risk of infection, which may worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and potential need for vasopressor support may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and potential cardiac arrest.

Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are essential to prevent these potential complications and optimize their care in the ICU."

   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2 administration. The patient is currently in the ICU with acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 7.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L and a sodium level of 134 mmol/L.

The patient's infection workup is pending, with cultures sent for urine, blood, and sputum. The patient is currently receiving antibiotic therapy with cefazolin for a skin infection.

The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, with a respiratory acidosis and a non-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's bicarbonate level is 20 mmol/L, and his anion gap is 15 mmol/L.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to assess the patient's response to treatment.
2. Adjustment of pressor support as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg.
3. Weaning of dopamine and phenylephrine as tolerated.
4. Consideration of steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse.
5. Support of blood pressure with vasopressors as needed.
6. Monitoring of creatinine and urine output to assess the patient's renal function.
7. Check of pm lytes to assess the patient's electrolyte levels.
8. Consideration of urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve.
9. Infectious workup, including cultures and Gram stain, to assess the patient's risk of infection.
10. Consideration of C. difficile infection, although less likely given recent antibiotic exposure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
2. Sepsis
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI)
4. Cardiac arrhythmias
5. Electrolyte imbalances
6. Infection, including C. difficile
7. Adrenal insufficiency
8. Hypertension
9. Hyperkalemia
10. Hypotension

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been in the ICU for several days. They were initially diagnosed with respiratory failure, which has since resolved. The patient has been experiencing delirium, diarrhea, and hypotension, which are all concerning symptoms.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 143/78 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 99% and their temperature is 37.1°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are well-nourished and overweight, with no acute distress. Their eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and their head, ears, nose, and throat are also normal. Their cardiovascular examination reveals a normal pulse, and their respiratory examination reveals clear lung fields with a few mid-inspiratory crackles.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Delirium
* Diarrhea

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to monitor creatinine levels
* Autodiuresis to help manage fluid balance
* Transfer back to the medical floor
* Continue to monitor vital signs and laboratory results

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Worsening of acute kidney injury
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Respiratory failure or ARDS
* Hypotension or shock
* Delirium or agitation
* Diarrhea or gastrointestinal bleeding
* Electrolyte imbalances or metabolic acidosis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."
