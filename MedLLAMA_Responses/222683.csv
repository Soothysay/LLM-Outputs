   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt in new a-fib w/ RVR. Given his severe AS the patient is
   preload dependent and hesitant to drop preload with IV push of nodal
   agents.  He was started on esmolol gtt, digoxin, and heparin gtt in the
   ED. Unclear as to what set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs.
   infection vs. PE (right axis) vs ACS, but less likely.  Esmolol was d/c
   given hypotension and lack of HR control and will plan for
   cardioversion.  Given severe AS patient is high risk at elevated rate.
   - plan for cardioversion at bedside with anesthesia
   - consider amio gtt
   - cont digoxin load and check ecg for toxicity
   - cont heparin gtt
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - pt already took home toprol xl. Will reassess after cardioversion
   - hold BP meds to allow for increase in BP.
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP this AM. CE showed Trop 0.33, CK 295, MB:
   19, MBI: 6.4. ECG showed old RBBB and new RAD. non-specific ST changes
   anteriorly and inferiorly at his fast rate. He already took ASA 325mg
   at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due to his severe
   AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention. No prior cath or h/o
   ACS, however high liklihood of cardiac disease given severe PVD. Pt
   currently CP free.  Elevation in cardiac enzymes likley combination of
   ARF and demand rather then thrombus.
   - trend CE
   - cont heparin gtt
   - cont ASA
   - hold plavix
   - cont BB, statin
   - holding ACEI given ARF
   - ECG
   - monitor on tele
   - will keep NPO overnight for possible cath in AM
   .
   # PUMP: Grade II dCHF. Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and no
   evidence of pulm edema on CXR.  Pt was on lasix at home despite ARF
   - daily weights, I/O, and monitor resp status
   - hold lasix given ARF
   - IVF prn for hypovolemia
   - check TTE
   .
   #. AS: Pt with severe AS. Denied syncope, CHF, or CP (except episode
   today). Valve area 0.8-1.0cm2 and peak gradient 58mmHg
   - patient pre-load dependent
   - esmolol for rate control so that we can d/c if hypotensive
   - IVF
   - TTE
   - management of AF as above
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.
   - recheck UA
   - add on diff to check for eosinophilia
   - urine lytes and eos
   - hold lasix and ACEI
   - renal U/S
   - trend cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - OSH records regarding ARF and ?AIN
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin
   - hold on prednisone until obtain records. Usually, will biopsy confirm
   AIN prior to treatment. Pt denied biopsy
   .
   #. UTI: Pt UA with WBC and RBC with many bacteria. Pt has no urinary
   complaints. Pt does have leukocytosis, but afebrile. Infection vs. GN.
   - tx with cipro
   - f/u Ucx
   .
   #. DOE: [**Doctor Last Name **] score 4.5, moderate prob. LENI negatives. Unable to
   obtain CTA given ARF. Pt already on heparin gtt. No evidence of
   consoliation or pulm edema.  DOE could be related to a-fib.
   - consider V/Q scan
   - management as above
   .
   #. Lower Ext Cellulitis: Pt with likley left foot cellulitis. Pt
   evaluated by vascular who recommended abx treatment. U/S negative for
   DVT.
   - Vanco IV for now
   - will also treat with cipro given UTI as above
   - f/u vascular consult recs
   - f/u LENI final read
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Infectious workup as above. UTI, cellulits. CXR no
   consolidation. Also patient has been on steroids.
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt states received 4U pRBC at OSH. No clear source of blood
   loss. Denied melana or BRBPR. Possible anemia from AS.
   - T&S
   - Fe studies
   - guaiac stools
   - trend Hct
   .
   # Hyponatermia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatermia. Pt received 1.25L in
   the ED.
   - urine lytes and osm
   - IVF prn
   - cont to trend
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: although need to check albumin to correct for gap.
   No evidence of GI loss. Likely secondary to ARF.
   - check lactate
   - check albumin and recalculate gap
   - ARF management as above
   - infectious workup as above
   .
   # Diabetes: Diet controlled, but on admission glc 300's. Likely
   combination of stress and initiation of steriods.
   - QACHS FS and cover with FS
   - diabetic diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was cardioverted yesterday. He has been experiencing low blood pressure overnight, despite good mentation, urine output, and well-perfused extremities. He has been receiving various medications, including heparin, propofol, and digoxin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
	* Severe aortic stenosis can cause heart failure, angina, and sudden cardiac death.
	* Hypotension can exacerbate cardiac complications.
2. **Renal Complications:**
	* Acute kidney injury (ARF) can lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
	* Hypovolemia can worsen ARF.
	* Infection can cause sepsis and further compromise renal function.
3. **Infectious Complications:**
	* UTI can spread to the bloodstream and cause sepsis.
	* Cellulitis can lead to sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis.
	* Infection can cause anemia, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia.
4. **Hematological Complications:**
	* Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
	* Leukocytosis can indicate infection or inflammation.
	* Thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. **Metabolic Complications:**
	* Hyperglycemia can cause ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and increased risk of infection.
	* Hyponatremia can cause seizures, coma, and brain damage.
	* Acidosis can cause respiratory and cardiac complications.
6. **Other Complications:**
	* DVT prophylaxis with heparin gtt can increase the risk of bleeding.
	* Stress ulcer prophylaxis with histamine-2 receptor antagonists can increase the risk of pneumonia.
	* VAP prophylaxis with subglottic suctioning can increase the risk of pneumonia.

**Plan:**

The patient will continue to receive supportive care, including IV fluids, oxygen therapy, and anticoagulation therapy. He will be monitored closely for signs of cardiac, renal, and infectious complications. Further diagnostic tests, such as echocardiography, renal ultrasound, and blood cultures, will be performed as needed. The patient's medications will be adjusted as necessary to manage his symptoms and prevent complications."

   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**], [**Name (NI) 7045**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   As above, Mr. [**Known lastname 12127**] is a pleasant pharmacist who owns his own
   pharmacy in [**Location (un) 101**] who presents with AF with RVR and DOE for one week.
   He was recently diagnosed with ARF on CRF and was given steroids for ?
   Diclox induced renal failure. Fri evening prior to admission he
   developed palpitations with 5/10 chest pain. He presented to the ED and
   was found to be in AF with RVR at 120-140 bpm. Creat was 2.1. He was
   started on an Esmolol drip and given a bolus dose of 0.25 mg Digoxin
   without much reduction in heart rate and ongoing hypotension to
   80-90mmm systolic. He had ongoing hypotension so he was cardioverted
   with 200J sync cardioversion last night. This am he remained relatively
   hypotensive without symptoms. Two of 4 blood culture bottles were
   positive for GNR and so he was started on Miripenim, cipro and vanco.
   Biomarkers were continuing to rise. Therefore, it appears that the
   patient may have developed a UTI which led to bacteremia, hypotension
   the AF with RVR. Will check an echo today to evaluate the AoValve.
   Continue antibiotics for Urosepsis. His NSTEMi is likely demand related
   secondary to hypotension and AF with RVR and so I would recommend a
   cath for AS and coronary anatomy prior to d/c.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2351**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**], [**Name (NI) 7045**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   As above, Mr. [**Known lastname 12127**] is a pleasant pharmacist who owns his own
   pharmacy in [**Location (un) 101**] who presents with AF with RVR and DOE for one week.
   He was recently diagnosed with ARF on CRF and was given steroids for ?
   Diclox induced renal failure. Fri evening prior to admission he
   developed palpitations with 5/10 chest pain. He presented to the ED and
   was found to be in AF with RVR at 120-140 bpm. Creat was 2.1. He was
   started on an Esmolol drip and given a bolus dose of 0.25 mg Digoxin
   without much reduction in heart rate and ongoing hypotension to
   80-90mmm systolic. He had ongoing hypotension so he was cardioverted
   with 200J sync cardioversion last night. This am he remained relatively
   hypotensive without symptoms. Two of 4 blood culture bottles were
   positive for GNR and so he was started on Miripenim, cipro and vanco.
   Biomarkers were continuing to rise. Therefore, it appears that the
   patient may have developed a UTI which led to bacteremia, hypotension
   the AF with RVR. Will check an echo today to evaluate the AoValve.
   Continue antibiotics for Urosepsis. His NSTEMi is likely demand related
   secondary to hypotension and AF with RVR and so I would recommend a
   cath for AS and coronary anatomy prior to d/c.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2351**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 861**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2189-12-21**] 07:14 PM ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and was cardioverted yesterday. He has been experiencing hypotension overnight, despite good mentation, urine output, and well-perfused extremities.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin, propofol, and antibiotics. His laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating potential cardiac injury and inflammation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft and non-tender abdomen, no evidence of pulmonary edema, and a normal jugular venous pressure. His cardiac examination shows a grade III/VI systolic murmur with delayed carotid upstrokes.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, which is exacerbated by his severe aortic stenosis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF with RVR may be contributing to his hypotension and cardiac instability.
3. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin-T and CK levels suggest potential cardiac injury, which may be related to his AF with RVR or demand ischemia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 0.8-1.0 mg/dL, and he has been experiencing acute kidney injury (AKI) with a peak creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL.
5. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Gram-negative rods (GNR), and he is receiving antibiotics for suspected urosepsis.
6. Lower extremity cellulitis: The patient has likely left foot cellulitis, which is being treated with antibiotics.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.3 g/dL, which may be related to his anemia of chronic disease, chronic kidney disease, or blood loss.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which may be due to hypovolemia or SIADH.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and AF with RVR may be contributing to his cardiac failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's AKI may be related to his underlying chronic kidney disease, hypovolemia, or sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and suspected urosepsis may be contributing to his sepsis.
4. Lower extremity compartment syndrome: The patient's left foot cellulitis may be complicated by compartment syndrome.
5. Non-gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis may be related to his underlying chronic kidney disease, hypovolemia, or sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Cardioversion: The patient's AF with RVR was cardioverted yesterday, and he is being monitored for recurrence.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected urosepsis and lower extremity cellulitis.
3. Fluid management: The patient is receiving IV fluids to manage his hypovolemia and hyponatremia.
4. Cardiac catheterization: The patient is scheduled for cardiac catheterization to evaluate his aortic valve and coronary anatomy.
5. Renal management: The patient's AKI is being managed with IV fluids and diuretics, and he is being monitored for signs of worsening kidney function.
6. Infection control: The patient's bacteremia and suspected urosepsis are being managed with antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of sepsis.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a-fib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He presented with a-fib and was cardioverted to sinus rhythm. He has been experiencing hypotension, despite good mentation, urine output, and perfused extremities, and has received a total of 1.5 L of fluids overnight.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including severe AS, which makes him preload-dependent. He is at risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, and has a history of PVD, which increases his risk of peripheral ischemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's severe AS, he is at risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, and may require close monitoring and treatment with medications and possibly invasive procedures.
2. Renal complications: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) and is at risk for further kidney damage. He will require close monitoring of his kidney function and may require dialysis.
3. Infection: The patient has a UTI and bacteremia with GNR, and may be at risk for further infections, including pneumonia and sepsis.
4. Hypovolemic shock: The patient has received a total of 1.5 L of fluids overnight, but his blood pressure remains low, and he may be at risk for hypovolemic shock.
5. Thrombotic complications: The patient is at risk for thrombotic complications, including DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), due to his severe AS and PVD.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to his AS, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to his hypovolemia, and may require close monitoring and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or V/Q scan, to rule out pulmonary embolism.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's anemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hyponatremia and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's hypovolemic shock.

Note: The patient's medical history and current condition are complex, and a detailed understanding of his medical history and current condition is necessary to provide accurate and effective treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took ASA 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due
   to his severe AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention.  Currently
   CP free with downtrending CE.
   - cont heparin gtt
   - cont ASA, hold plavix
   - cont BB, statin
   - holding ACEI given ARF
   - ECG , TTE in am

   # PUMP: Grade II dCHF. Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and no
   evidence of pulm edema on CXR.  Pt was on lasix at home despite ARF
   - daily weights, I/O, and monitor resp status
   - hold lasix given ARF
   - IVF prn for hypovolemia
   - check TTE
   .
   #. AS: Pt with severe AS. Denied syncope, CHF, or CP (except episode
   today). Valve area 0.8-1.0cm2 and median gradient 58mmHg

   - TTE
   - management of AF as above
   .
   #. Bacteremia: [**2-11**] blood cx with GNR, leukocytosis but afebrile.  Low
   BP could be indicative of developing sepsis.  UTI, cellulits. CXR no
   consolidation. Also patient has been on steroids.
   - monitor BP on A-line, keep MAP > 60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - infectious workup as above
   - continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.   Urine lytes consistent
   with prerenal  etiology

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who presents with a-fib and RVR, severe AS, HTN, HL, diet-controlled DM, and PVD. He has undergone cardioversion and is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 80/41 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck, a grade III/VI late-peaking semisystolic murmur, and crackles and expiratory wheeze at the right lower lung field. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no evidence of abdominal bruits or masses. His extremities are well-perfused, with no evidence of peripheral edema or cyanosis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.6 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 22.9%
* Platelet count: 78 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 3.87 ng/mL

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of bilateral LE DVT, likely right thigh hematoma, and no acute intra-thoracic process on CXR.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue heparin gtt for anticoagulation
* Hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. Consider V/Q scan
* Hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
* Patient may need BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and a-line for closer monitoring

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac complications: Given the patient's severe AS and recent cardioversion, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's ARF and hypovolemia put him at risk for further renal dysfunction or failure.
* Infectious complications: The patient's bacteremia and UTI put him at risk for developing sepsis or other infections.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's hypovolemia and ARF may lead to respiratory compromise or failure.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's hyponatremia and potential electrolyte imbalances may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and potential bleeding diathesis may lead to hematological complications such as bleeding or anemia.
* Neurological complications: The patient's potential electrolyte imbalances and ARF may lead to neurological symptoms such as seizures or altered mental status.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took ASA 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due
   to his severe AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention.  Currently
   CP free with downtrending CE.

   - IVF
   - TTE
   - management of AF as above
   .
   #. Bacteremia: [**2-11**] blood cx with GNR, leukocytosis but afebrile.  Low
   BP could be indicative of developing sepsis.  Etiology: likely UTI vs
   cellulits. CXR with no consolidation. Also patient has been on steroids
   so is high risk for serious infection.
   - monitor BP on A-line, keep MAP > 60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - infectious workup as above
   - continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx
   - ID consult
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.   Urine lytes consistent
   with prerenal  etiology
   - recheck UA
   - hold lasix and ACEI
   - renal U/S
   - trend cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - OSH records regarding ARF and ?AIN
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin and pcn

   #. DOE: [**Doctor Last Name **] score 4.5, moderate prob. LENI negatives. Unable to
   obtain CTA given ARF. Pt already on heparin gtt. No evidence of
   consoliation or pulm edema.  DOE could be related to a-fib.
   - consider V/Q scan
   - management as above
   .
   #. Lower Ext Cellulitis: Pt with likley left foot cellulitis. Pt
   evaluated by vascular who recommended abx treatment. U/S negative for
   DVT.  No other sx of compartment syndrome or acute lower extremity
   ischemia
   - Vanco IV for now
   - will also treat with cipro given UTI as above

   - f/u LENI final read
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt states received 4U pRBC at OSH. No clear source of blood
   loss. Denied melana or BRBPR. Possible anemia from AS.  Iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronich dx
 i.e. chronich renal
   insufficiency.  Large drop in Hct from overnight, not fully explained
   by dilution
   - T&S
   - transfuse with 2 UpRBC, consider adding lasix if sx of volume

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history, including:

* Decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF) grade II
* Severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm² and median gradient of 58 mmHg
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Diet-controlled diabetes
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a history of left axillary bifemoral bypass and left fem-pop bypass with internal saphenous vein (ISSV)

The patient was admitted with atrial fibrillation (a-fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was cardioverted to sinus rhythm. He has been experiencing low blood pressure (SBP 70-80 mmHg) despite good mentation, urine output, and well-perfused extremities.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Hypovolemia: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has received a total of 1.5 L of fluid overnight. He may be at risk for hypovolemic shock.
* Sepsis: The patient has a blood culture positive for a Gram-negative rod (GNR), and he has leukocytosis but is afebrile. He is at risk for developing sepsis, particularly given his history of steroids and his low blood pressure.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.8-1.0 mg/dL, but it increased to 2.1 mg/dL on admission. He has a history of ARF at the outside hospital (OSH) and was treated with prednisone.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin has decreased significantly overnight, and he has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
* Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, likely due to hypovolemia.
* Non-gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap is normal, but his bicarbonate level is low. This may be due to ARF or other underlying conditions.
* Lower extremity cellulitis: The patient has likely left foot cellulitis, which is being treated with antibiotics.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk for cardiovascular instability due to his severe AS and history of PVD.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 78 K/μL
* White blood cell count: 6.6 K/μL
* Troponin-T: 3.87 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing heparin therapy for anticoagulation
* Holding ACE inhibitors due to ARF
* Monitoring his blood pressure and adjusting his fluid status as needed
* Trending his creatinine and electrolyte levels
* Considering a V/Q scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolism
* Treating his cellulitis with antibiotics
* Monitoring his blood cultures and infectious workup
* Considering a renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or other causes of ARF
* Holding off on Dicloxacillin and prednisone until further evaluation and treatment can be determined."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR. Given his severe AS the patient
   is preload dependent and hesitant to drop preload with IV push of nodal
   agents.  He was started on esmolol gtt, digoxin, and heparin gtt in the
   ED. Unclear as to what set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs.
   infection vs. PE (right axis) vs ACS, but less likely.  Esmolol was d/c
   given hypotension and lack of HR control and will plan for
   cardioversion.  Given severe AS patient is high risk at elevated rate.
   - plan for cardioversion at bedside with anesthesia
   - consider amio gtt
   - cont digoxin load and check ecg for toxicity
   - cont heparin gtt
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - pt already took home toprol xl. Will reassess after cardioversion
   - hold BP meds to allow for increase in BP.

   at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due to his severe
   AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention. No prior cath or h/o
   ACS, however high liklihood of cardiac disease given severe PVD. Pt
   currently CP free.  Elevation in cardiac enzymes likley combination of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR. Given his severe AS the patient
   is preload dependent and hesitant to drop preload with IV push of nodal
   agents.  He was started on esmolol gtt, digoxin, and heparin gtt in the
   ED. Unclear as to what set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs.
   infection vs. PE (right axis) vs ACS, but less likely.  Esmolol was d/c
   given hypotension and lack of HR control and will plan for
   cardioversion.  Given severe AS patient is high risk at elevated rate.
   - plan for cardioversion at bedside with anesthesia
   - consider amio gtt

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history, including severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and was found to have a low blood pressure, despite good perfusion of extremities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 80/41 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft and non-tender abdomen, with no evidence of ascites or hepatosplenomegaly. His extremities show no signs of edema or cyanosis. He has a well-healed surgical scar over the bilateral groin, and a fluid collection over the right anterior thigh.

Laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level of 3.87 ng/mL, and a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL. His hemoglobin level is 7.3 g/dL, and his platelet count is 78 K/uL. His white blood cell count is 6.6 K/uL, and his blood urea nitrogen level is 15 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for a left axillary bifemoral bypass and a left fem-pop bypass with internal saphenous vein graft, as well as a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

The patient's current medications include heparin, digoxin, esmolol, and ciprofloxacin. He is also receiving IV fluids and oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and severe aortic stenosis make him at high risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
2. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further renal impairment or failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula, but he may be at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a history of infections, including urinary tract infections and cellulitis.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin therapy, and he is at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation make him at high risk for thrombotic complications, including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.3 g/dL, and he may be at risk for further anemia or bleeding complications.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, and he may be at risk for further hyponatremia or seizures.
9. Non-gap acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and he may be at risk for further acidosis or metabolic complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe aortic valve stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, type II, and impaired skin integrity. The patient developed septic shock, acute renal failure, and respiratory alkalosis during his stay in the ICU. He has also experienced eosinophilia and allergic reactions to antibiotics, including dicloxacillin and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive cardiac failure: The patient's severe aortic valve stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation may lead to further cardiac decompensation, including increased heart failure symptoms, decreased cardiac output, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Worsening renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or even require dialysis if not managed effectively.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory alkalosis may lead to respiratory acidosis, which can further compromise his respiratory status.
4. Infection: The patient's septic shock and eosinophilia may indicate a high risk of developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of skin breakdown may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers, surgical site infections, and other skin-related complications.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac condition, including his aortic valve stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation, may lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and impaired skin integrity may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, and malnutrition.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac condition and respiratory compromise may increase his risk of developing neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took ASA 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due
   to his severe AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention.  Currently
   CP free with downtrending CE.
   - cont heparin gtt
   - cont ASA, hold plavix
   - cont BB, statin
   - holding ACEI given ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Renal U/S: [**12-21**]: No hydronephrosis. No evidence of renal artery
   stenosis
   Echo: [**12-21**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional function is grossly
   normal ? Focal hypokinesis of basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Doppler
   parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.
   Assessment and Plan

   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diet-controlled diabetes, who presented to the emergency department with a new onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has severe aortic stenosis, and his cardiac function is compromised. He also has acute kidney injury, anemia, and eosinophilia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Heart failure: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to severe aortic stenosis, and he may develop heart failure.
	* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke.
	* Myocardial infarction: The patient's coronary artery disease and cardiac function compromise increase the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
	* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events and decreased quality of life.
3. Infection complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's eosinophilia and acute kidney injury increase the risk of sepsis.
	* Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may worsen, leading to sepsis and increased risk of complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and cardiac function compromise increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* Malnutrition: The patient's diet-controlled diabetes and cardiac function compromise increase the risk of malnutrition.
5. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
	* Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia may worsen, leading to increased risk of allergic reactions and increased risk of complications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Renal U/S: [**12-21**]: No hydronephrosis. No evidence of renal artery
   stenosis
   Echo: [**12-21**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional function is grossly
   normal ? Focal hypokinesis of basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Doppler
   parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Unclear etiology as to what set off his a-fib, most likely caused by
   severe infection.  However, given CHADS score of 3, patient should be
   anticoagulated for now although could likely stop if remains in sinus
   rhythm
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation. Will start coumadin if no
   intervention by vascular is planned
   - restart low dose B-blocker, can up-titrate as tolerate
   - d/c a-line as pt hemodynamically stable
   .
   #. Bacteremia: [**2-11**] blood cx on [**12-20**] with GNR.  Hemodynamically stable,
   afebrile with resolving leukocytosis.  Etiology: likely from e.coli UTI
   vs cellulits but would also consider seeding of hematoma, graft
   infection.  Currently on broad spectrum abx with meropenem, clinda and
   vancomycin (for LLE cellulitis)
   - hold steriods
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - imaging of lower extremity grafts to look for etiology of infection
   - continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took [**Month/Year (2) **] 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt, plavix held given
   possible need for surgical intervention.  [**Hospital 12172**] medical therapy as
   patient is not a good candidate for intervention given sepsis
   - cont [**Hospital **], statin
   - restart low dose b-blocker given improved hypotension, ACEI given
   improving Creatinine
   - monitor on tele
   - further risk stratification as outpatient with stress test
   .
   # PUMP: Grade II dCHF. Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and no
   evidence of pulm edema on CXR.  Pt was on lasix at home despite ARF.
   TTE with LVEF of 55%
   - daily weights, I/O, and monitor resp status
   - hold lasix given ARF
   - IVF prn for hypovolemia
   .
   #. AS: Pt with severe AS severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8cm2, peak gradient 64mmhg and mean gradient 42mmHg). Denied syncope,
   CHF, or CP (except episode prior to discharge).  Candidate for AVR but
   not until infection resolves
   - patient pre-load dependent, bolus with IVF prn hypotension
   - management of AF as above
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1, currently improving
   to 1.7.   Labs with borderline hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.
   Reportly in ARF at OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started
   on prednisone.  UA showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential
   pre-renal, ATN, infection or obstruction. Urine lytes consistent with
   prerenal  etiology.  Renal U/S with no abnormality.  Pt with low
   platelets and anemia, but they are at his baseline and unchanged so
   unlikely TTP/HUS.
   - restart ACEI as renal function has improved
   - start sodium bicarb TID as per renal recs
   - hold on steroids as pt has severe systemic infection
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin and pcn
   - appreciate renal recs.
   .
   #. Lower Ext Cellulitis: Pt with likley left foot cellulitis. Pt
   evaluated by vascular who recommended abx treatment. U/S negative for
   DVT.  No other sx of compartment syndrome or acute lower extremity
   ischemia
   - Vanco IV for now
   - will also treat with cipro given UTI as above
   - f/u vascular consult recs
   - imaging of lower extremity grafts to rule out vegetations
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt states received 4U pRBC at OSH, s/p 2 UpRBC here after
   large drop in Hct after admission. No clear source of blood loss.
   Denied melana or BRBPR. Possible anemia from AS.  Iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronich dx
 i.e. chronich renal
   insufficiency.
   - active T&S, transfuse if Hct < 24
   - guaiac stools
   - trend Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: although need to check albumin to correct for gap.
   No evidence of GI loss. Likely secondary to ARF.
   - check albumin and recalculate gap
   - ARF management as above
   - sodium bicarb replacement
   .
   # Diabetes: Diet controlled, but on admission glc 300's. Likely
   combination of stress and initiation of steriods.
   - QACHS FS and cover with FS

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 12127**] is doing very well today with no CP or SOB. Blood cultures
   are positive for E-coli likely urine source. BP much better now off his
   aggressive cardiac regimen and improvement in sepsis. Echo yesterday
   demonstrated AS with gradients 60 (peak)/42 (mean) with [**Location (un) 342**] 0.8 cm2.
   Vascular surgery and ID are following for potential seeding of his
   grafts with e-coli and so he remains on Miripenim, Vanco and Cipro
   until sensitivies return. Hct up to 24 from 21 after 2 u PRBC. For his
   NSTEMI he will continue [**Last Name (LF) 12170**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] and we will resume a lower dose of
   BB and ACEI. We will perform a PMIBI prior to discharge for risk
   stratification. Will continue coumadin for PAF on admission. DR.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 161**] who has seen the patient on prior hospital admissions will
   follow the patient on F3
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # RHYTHM: present in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Unclear etiology as to what set off his a-fib, most likely caused by
   severe infection.  However, given CHADS score of 3, patient should be
   anticoagulated for now although could likely stop if remains in sinus
   rhythm
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation. Will start coumadin if no

   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took [**Month/Year (2) **] 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt, plavix held given
   possible need for surgical intervention.  [**Hospital 12172**] medical therapy as
   patient is not a good candidate for intervention given sepsis

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 12127**] is doing very well today with no CP or SOB. Blood cultures
   are positive for E-coli likely urine source. BP much better now off his
   aggressive cardiac regimen and improvement in sepsis. Echo yesterday
   demonstrated AS with gradients 60 (peak)/42 (mean) with [**Location (un) 342**] 0.8 cm2.
   Vascular surgery and ID are following for potential seeding of his
   grafts with e-coli and so he remains on Miripenim, Vanco and Cipro
   until sensitivies return. Hct up to 24 from 21 after 2 u PRBC. For his
   NSTEMI he will continue [**Last Name (LF) 12170**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] and we will resume a lower dose of
   BB and ACEI. We will perform a PMIBI prior to discharge for risk
   stratification. Will continue coumadin for PAF on admission. DR.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 161**] who has seen the patient on prior hospital admissions will
   follow the patient on F3
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history, including severe aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presented with atrial fibrillation (AF) and was converted to sinus rhythm (SR) after cardioversion.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. A-fib: The patient had a new onset of AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was converted to SR after cardioversion. He is at risk for stroke, and anticoagulation therapy is recommended.
2. Severe AS: The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.8 cm2, peak gradient of 64 mmHg, and mean gradient of 42 mmHg. He is at risk for heart failure and may require aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the future.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by E. coli, which is likely related to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cellulitis.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has AKI with a baseline creatinine level of 0.8-1.0 mg/dL, which has increased to 1.7 mg/dL. He is at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may require dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely related to his underlying medical conditions, including AS and CKD.
6. Non-gap acidosis: The patient has non-gap acidosis, which is likely related to his AKI and metabolic acidosis.
7. Lower extremity cellulitis: The patient has likely left foot cellulitis, which is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin, to treat his bacteremia and cellulitis.
2. Cardiovascular medications: The patient is receiving medications to manage his cardiovascular conditions, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins.
3. Anti-coagulation therapy: The patient is receiving heparin and coumadin to prevent stroke and thromboembolism.
4. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain management medications, including tramadol and tylenol, to manage his pain.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated creatinine: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.7 mg/dL, indicating AKI.
2. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN): The patient's BUN level is elevated, indicating AKI.
3. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response.
4. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP): The patient's CRP level is elevated, indicating inflammation.

The patient's radiology results show:

1. Echo: The patient's echocardiogram shows severe AS with a valve area of 0.8 cm2, peak gradient of 64 mmHg, and mean gradient of 42 mmHg.
2. Renal ultrasound: The patient's renal ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis or renal artery stenosis.

The patient's physical examination shows:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely related to his bacteremia and cellulitis.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which is likely related to his bacteremia and AKI.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which is likely related to his bacteremia and AKI.
4. Edema: The patient has edema, which is likely related to his AKI and heart failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics to treat his bacteremia and cellulitis.
2. Cardiovascular management: The patient will continue to receive medications to manage his cardiovascular conditions, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins.
3. Anti-coagulation therapy: The patient will continue to receive heparin and coumadin to prevent stroke and thromboembolism.
4. Pain management: The patient will continue to receive pain management medications to manage his pain.
5. Renal management: The patient will receive close monitoring of his renal function and will be treated with dialysis if necessary.
6. Cardiac management: The patient will receive close monitoring of his cardiac function and will be treated with medications to manage his heart failure.
7. Wound care: The patient will receive wound care to manage his cellulitis.

Overall, the patient has a complex medical condition that requires close monitoring and management. He is at risk for various complications, including stroke, heart failure, and CKD, and will require close follow-up and treatment to manage his condition."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 12127**] is doing very well today with no CP or SOB. Blood cultures
   are positive for E-coli likely urine source. BP much better now off his
   aggressive cardiac regimen and improvement in sepsis. Echo yesterday
   demonstrated AS with gradients 60 (peak)/42 (mean) with [**Location (un) 342**] 0.8 cm2.
   Vascular surgery and ID are following for potential seeding of his
   grafts with e-coli and so he remains on Miripenim, Vanco and Cipro
   until sensitivies return. Hct up to 24 from 21 after 2 u PRBC. For his
   NSTEMI he will continue [**Last Name (LF) 12170**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] and we will resume a lower dose of
   BB and ACEI. We will perform a PMIBI prior to discharge for risk
   stratification. Will continue coumadin for PAF on admission. DR.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 161**] who has seen the patient on prior hospital admissions will
   follow the patient on F3
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Echo: [**12-21**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional function is grossly
   normal ? Focal hypokinesis of basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Doppler
   parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 12127**] is doing very well today with no CP or SOB. Blood cultures
   are positive for E-coli likely urine source. BP much better now off his
   aggressive cardiac regimen and improvement in sepsis. Echo yesterday
   demonstrated AS with gradients 60 (peak)/42 (mean) with [**Location (un) 342**] 0.8 cm2.
   Vascular surgery and ID are following for potential seeding of his
   grafts with e-coli and so he remains on Miripenim, Vanco and Cipro
   until sensitivies return. Hct up to 24 from 21 after 2 u PRBC. For his
   NSTEMI he will continue [**Last Name (LF) 12170**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] and we will resume a lower dose of
   BB and ACEI. We will perform a PMIBI prior to discharge for risk
   stratification. Will continue coumadin for PAF on admission. DR.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 161**] who has seen the patient on prior hospital admissions will
   follow the patient on F3
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history, including severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cardiac catheterization and bypass surgery. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.8°C, HR 65 bpm, BP 115/61 mmHg, RR 19 breaths/min, SpO2 97%
* Laboratory results: WBC 6.6, Hct 24.3%, Plt 78, Cr 1.8 mg/dL, TropT 3.87 ng/mL, TCO2 14 mmol/L, Glucose 139 mg/dL
* Echocardiogram: Severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 cm2, peak gradient of 64 mmHg, and mean gradient of 42 mmHg. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is also present.
* Renal function: Acute kidney injury (AKI) with a baseline creatinine of 0.8-1.0 mg/dL, currently at 2.1 mg/dL. Urine output is 620 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Infectious workup: Blood cultures are positive for E. coli, likely originating from a urinary tract infection. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin.
* Cardiac function: The patient is preload-dependent and is being managed with IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 60 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of aortic stenosis: The patient's severe aortic stenosis is a significant risk factor for cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's AKI is likely to progress if not managed promptly and aggressively.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of a pacemaker make him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's bleeding diathesis, including thrombocytopenia and anemia, make him at risk for hemorrhagic complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria.
6. Infection of the grafts: The patient's history of vascular surgery and the presence of grafts make him at risk for infection of the grafts, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored in the ICU, with regular assessments of his cardiac, renal, and respiratory function. Aggressive management of his sepsis, including prompt administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control, is essential. Cardiovascular support, including IV fluids and vasopressors, should be continued to maintain a MAP of greater than 60 mmHg. The patient's bleeding diathesis should be closely monitored, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent hemorrhagic complications. Finally, the patient's grafts should be carefully monitored for signs of infection, and prompt surgical intervention should be undertaken if infection is suspected."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, type II, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate is 65 beats per minute, blood pressure is 115/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion at 1,250 units per hour.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 3,986 mL of fluids, with 2,616 mL being intravenous fluids, and has lost 2,105 mL of fluids through urine and other means.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving any oxygen therapy.
* Physical examination: The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete, and the skin, neurologic, and other systems are not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cell count is 6.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count is 92 x 10^9/L.
* Blood chemistry: Creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 12 mmol/L, and electrolyte levels are within normal range.
* Troponin-T: 3.87 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 401 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.6 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for severe aortic valve stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function, but with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.

The patient's diagnosis is:

* Shock
* Septic cellulitis
* Atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure, acute
* Diabetes mellitus, type II
* Impaired skin integrity
* Chest pain
* Dyspnea

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Nutrition: Glycemic control and nutrition therapy
* Lines: 18-gauge and arterial line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* ICU care: Monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: Heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Renal complications: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease
* Infectious complications: Sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
* Gastrointestinal complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting
* Skin complications: Skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, and sepsis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."
