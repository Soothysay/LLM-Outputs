Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a trauma patient who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of seizure, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.54, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 40 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 11 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 383 K/uL, and creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, and the lactate level is 1.8 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for a seizure disorder, and they have been receiving Dilantin therapy since admission. The patient's family history is significant for a history of seizures.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizure disorder may lead to recurrent seizures if not properly managed.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase the risk of infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and lactate level may indicate the presence of sepsis.
5. ARDS: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Bleeding: The patient's elevated platelet count and creatinine level may indicate the presence of bleeding.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate the presence of renal failure.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium and magnesium levels may indicate the presence of an electrolyte imbalance.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory function.
2. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust Dilantin therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent infection and sepsis.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent worsening of ARDS.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent renal failure.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalance."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with h/o ETOH abuse now presents s/p witness seizure at home
   found to have ? right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and
   anemia with previous HCT baseline 30-33
   # Seizure: unclear etiology; could have likely been in the setting of
   an ICH since according to wife, the seizure occured after the first
   witnessed fall with head trauma.  Other possibilities include DTs
   though ETOH level 11 on admit. Metabolic disturbances such as
   hypoglycemia. h/o PE with LOC.  No specific neurological deficits on
   limited exam
   - NSURG/Neuro consults
   - dilantin load 1gm IV x 1 and then 100 mg TID; check level in AM
   - repeat non-contrast head CT in 12H to eval for interval change and
   r/o mass
   - infectious workup- blood cx, UA/urine cx
   - unlikely this is PE given good oxygenation; though patient does have
   sinus tachycardia
   - maintain SBP<140
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: pH 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 is 44, and HCO3 is 37.
   Unclear whether this is from GI losses given poor nutrition, renal
   losses
   - recheck lytes
   - NS bolus
   - D5NS x 1L at 100 cc/hr
   - check urine lytes
   #. Trauma- s/p fall.  CT head with right orbital fracture; no C-spine
   fractures noted on prelim read
   - consider trauma consult- isolated head injury so may not need full
   trauma consult; recheck HCT
   - plastics consult
   - c-collar in place; continue until cleared
   - f/u final CT read; logroll precautions for now; c-spine not cleared
   until final read
   #. Anemia: previous HCT 30-33, now currently 26.7.  MCV 91.  Guaiac
   negative in ED.  Has h/o portal grastropathy per record. FAST negative
   in ED.  no need for EGD at this time
   - guaiac all stools
   - check iron studies, B12, folate
   - recheck HCT on admit and in AM to assess for bleed
   #. Resp: Currently intubated on AC with good O2 sats.
   -          decrease FiO2 as tolerated; on 5 PEEP currently
   -          wean propofol to off
   -          RSBI with SBP; potentially can extubate in AM if able to
   respond to commands.  Try pressure support in AM
   # ETOH abuse: significant ETOH use.  unclear when last drink was. ETOH
   on admit 11.
   - ativan CIWA protocol once propofol weaned
   # FEN: NPO for now; nutrition consult for tube feeds

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 57-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a witnessed seizure at home. He has a history of ethanol abuse and was found to have a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 30%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 383 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 11.3 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* TCO2: 40 mmHg
* Glucose: 86 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
* LDH: 225 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Seizure: unclear etiology, possibly related to head trauma, ethanol withdrawal, or metabolic disturbances
* Metabolic alkalosis: pH 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 is 44, and HCO3 is 37
* Anemia: previous HCT 30-33, now currently 26.7, with a history of portal gastropathy
* Respiratory failure: acute, not ARDS
* Trauma: s/p fall, with a right orbital fracture and no C-spine fractures noted on preliminary read

Potential medical complications include:

* Neurological deterioration due to head trauma or seizure activity
* Infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or sepsis
* Bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke
* Respiratory failure or worsening respiratory status
* Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Metabolic disturbances, including hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Kidney injury or acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia or sepsis
* Gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding

The patient's plan of care includes:

* NSURG and neuro consults
* Dilantin load and maintenance therapy
* Repeat non-contrast head CT in 12 hours to evaluate for interval change and rule out mass
* Infectious workup, including blood cultures and urine cultures
* Maintenance of systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg
* Nutrition consult for tube feeds
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse who presented with a witnessed seizure at home. He has suffered a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.7Â°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.

The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and was found to have an ETOH level of 11 on admission. He has been treated with dilantin and is currently receiving propofol for sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show an anion gap metabolic alkalosis, with a pH of 7.54, pCO2 of 44, and HCO3 of 37. His hemoglobin level is 8.2 g/dL, and his platelet count is 383 K/uL.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a right humeral head fracture and a right superior orbital fracture, which is being managed conservatively.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently receiving dilantin for prophylaxis.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic alkalosis, which is being managed with electrolyte replacement and close monitoring.
3. Anemia: The patient has a significant anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL.
4. Trauma: The patient has suffered a right frontal contusion and a right humeral head fracture, which is being managed conservatively.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
6. Ethanol abuse: The patient has a history of significant ETOH use and is currently receiving treatment for withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently receiving dilantin for prophylaxis. However, there is a risk of seizure recurrence if the patient's medication is not effective or if the patient experiences a withdrawal from the medication.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic alkalosis could progress to metabolic acidosis if the patient's electrolyte imbalance is not corrected.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's underlying condition worsens or if the patient experiences a complication such as pneumonia.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the respiratory tract.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of trauma and is at risk of bleeding, particularly if the patient's platelet count is low.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and is at risk of developing hypoglycemia if the patient's blood sugar levels are not closely monitored.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with h/o ETOH abuse now presents s/p witness seizure at home
   found to have ? right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and
   anemia with previous HCT baseline 30-33
   # Seizure: unclear etiology; could have likely been in the setting of
   an ICH since according to wife, the seizure occured after the first
   witnessed fall with head trauma.  Other possibilities include DTs
   though ETOH level 11 on admit. Metabolic disturbances such as
   hypoglycemia. h/o PE with LOC.  No specific neurological deficits on
   limited exam
   - NSURG/Neuro consults
   - dilantin load 1gm IV x 1 and then 100 mg TID; check level in AM
   - repeat non-contrast head CT in 12H to eval for interval change and
   r/o mass
   - infectious workup- blood cx, UA/urine cx
   - unlikely this is PE given good oxygenation; though patient does have
   sinus tachycardia
   - maintain SBP<140
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: pH 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 is 44, and HCO3 is 37.
   Unclear whether this is from GI losses given poor nutrition, renal
   losses
   - recheck lytes
   - NS bolus
   - D5NS x 1L at 100 cc/hr
   - check urine lytes
   #. Trauma- s/p fall.  CT head with right orbital fracture; no C-spine
   fractures noted on prelim read
   - consider trauma consult- isolated head injury so may not need full
   trauma consult; recheck HCT
   - plastics consult
   - c-collar in place; continue until cleared
   - f/u final CT read; logroll precautions for now; c-spine not cleared
   until final read
   #. Anemia: previous HCT 30-33, now currently 26.7.  MCV 91.  Guaiac
   negative in ED.  Has h/o portal grastropathy per record. FAST negative
   in ED.  no need for EGD at this time
   - guaiac all stools
   - check iron studies, B12, folate
   - recheck HCT on admit and in AM to assess for bleed
   #. Resp: Currently intubated on AC with good O2 sats.
   -          decrease FiO2 as tolerated; on 5 PEEP currently
   -          wean propofol to off
   -          RSBI with SBP; potentially can extubate in AM if able to
   respond to commands.  Try pressure support in AM
   # ETOH abuse: significant ETOH use.  unclear when last drink was. ETOH
   on admit 11.
   - ativan CIWA protocol once propofol weaned

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a witnessed seizure at home, following a fall with head trauma. He has a history of ethanol abuse and was found to have a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a sinus tachycardia and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including a CT scan showing a right superior minimally displaced orbital fracture, adjacent right basal frontal parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion with surrounding edema, and a CT spine showing a disc bulge at C3-C4. He also has a history of portal gastropathy and has been found to have guaiac-negative stools.

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including Dilantin, phenytoin, metoprolol, lorazepam, and propofol. He is also receiving a number of fluids, including D5NS and normal saline.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and has had a witnessed seizure at home. He is currently receiving Dilantin, but it is unclear whether this will be effective in preventing further seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but he may require further respiratory support in the future.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a pH of 7.54 on his ABG, which may be due to GI losses or renal losses. He may require further treatment to correct this.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of portal gastropathy and has been found to have guaiac-negative stools. He may require further treatment to correct his anemia.
5. Trauma: The patient has a number of traumatic injuries, including a right frontal contusion and a disc bulge at C3-C4. He may require further treatment to address these injuries.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and may be at risk for infection. He should be monitored closely for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased white blood cell count.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of portal gastropathy and has been found to have guaiac-negative stools. He may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and should be monitored closely for signs of bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a trauma victim with a head lesion, intubated and extubated, with ongoing respiratory support. The patient's mental status remains abnormal, and they are repeating a word continuously. The patient complained of blindness, but this was not confirmed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 111/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), with a normal hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct). The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, and their renal function is normal.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving respiratory support, and their respiratory status may deteriorate if the support is discontinued.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and Plt counts suggest an inflammatory response, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
3. Head trauma: The patient's head lesion may be causing neurological symptoms, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the injury.
4. Blindness: The patient's reported blindness is a concern and should be further evaluated to determine the cause and potential treatment options.
5. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizure activity may indicate a risk for future seizures, and anticonvulsant therapy may be necessary.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to their immobility and the presence of central lines.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate stress ulceration, and prophylaxis should be considered.

The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all efforts should be made to resuscitate the patient in the event of a cardiac arrest."

   57 yo male with h/o ETOH abuse now presents s/p witness seizure at home
   found to have ? right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and
   anemia with previous HCT baseline 30-33
   # Seizure: unclear etiology; could have likely been in the setting of
   an ICH since according to wife, the seizure occured after the first
   witnessed fall with head trauma.  Other possibilities include DTs
   though ETOH level 11 on admit. Metabolic disturbances such as
   hypoglycemia. h/o PE with LOC.  No specific neurological deficits on
   limited exam
   - NSURG/Neuro consults

   follow up dosing recs
   - repeat non-contrast head CT done, results pending
   - infectious workup- blood cx, urine cx pending. UA negative
   - unlikely this is PE given good oxygenation; though patient does have
   sinus tachycardia
   - maintain SBP<140
   -Concerning that pt was unresponsive this am off propofol for 4 hrs but
   has since cleared up, likelyl [**12-29**] meds given with intubation.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: pH 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 is 44, and HCO3 is 37.
   Unclear whether this is from GI losses given poor nutrition, renal
   losses

   negative in ED.  Has h/o portal grastropathy per record. FAST negative
   in ED.  no need for EGD at this time
   - guaiac all stools
   - check iron studies, B12, folate
   #. Resp: Was intubated on AC with good O2 sats.
   -          weaned propofol off but remained solmulent.
   -          RSBI 36 this am, once MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 619**] CPAP, extubated
   without difficulty
   # ETOH abuse: significant ETOH use.  unclear when last drink was. ETOH

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 57-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed seizure at home. He has a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia. He was intubated and received propofol, which was weaned off and replaced with CPAP. He was extubated without difficulty. The patient's mental status remains abnormal, and he is repeating words continuously. A CT scan showed a hypodensity in the head, which was recommended for further evaluation. The patient has a history of portal gastropathy and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: Given the patient's history of seizure and the unclear etiology of the seizure, there is a risk of seizure recurrence.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially given the patient's history of trauma and head injury.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of portal gastropathy and is at risk of developing an infection, especially given the presence of a NG tube and the patient's compromised immune system.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may be a result of GI losses or renal losses, and there is a risk of worsening if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be a result of bleeding or malnutrition, and there is a risk of worsening if not properly managed.
6. Trauma-related complications: The patient has a history of trauma, including a right orbital fracture and a humeral head fracture, and there is a risk of developing complications related to these injuries, such as compartment syndrome or nerve damage.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's head injury may lead to neurological complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema, which could worsen his mental status and overall condition.
8. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's history of ETOH abuse and his current state of intoxication may lead to withdrawal symptoms, which could worsen his mental status and overall condition.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of portal gastropathy and his current state of malnutrition may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, which could worsen his overall condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with h/o ETOH abuse now presents s/p witness seizure at home
   found to have ? right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and
   anemia with previous HCT baseline 30-33
   # Seizure: unclear etiology; could have likely been in the setting of
   an ICH since according to wife, the seizure occured after the first
   witnessed fall with head trauma.  Other possibilities include DTs
   though ETOH level 11 on admit. Metabolic disturbances such as
   hypoglycemia. h/o PE with LOC.  No specific neurological deficits on
   limited exam
   - NSURG/Neuro consults
   - dilantin loaded 1gm IV x 1 now on 100 mg TID; level this am 19.4,
   follow up dosing recs
   - repeat non-contrast head CT done
 unchanged from previous study
   - infectious workup- blood cx, urine cx pending. UA negative
 no cx
   results
   - unlikely this is PE given good oxygenation; though patient does have
   sinus tachycardia
   - maintain SBP<140
   -Concerning that pt was unresponsive this am off propofol for 4 hrs but
   has since cleared up, likelyl [**12-29**] meds given with intubation on [**11-11**]
   - now confused, based on d/w family pt is not at baseline
    .
   # Anemia: previous HCT 30-33, now currently 23.5.  MCV 91.  Guaiac
   negative in ED.  Has h/o portal grastropathy per record. FAST negative
   in ED.  no need for EGD at this time
   - guaiac all stools
   - check iron studies, B12, folate
   .
   #. Trauma- s/p fall.  CT head with right orbital fracture; no C-spine
   fractures noted on prelim read
   - neurosurg consult recs appreciated
 signed off, no acute issues
   - c-collar in place
 transitioned to [**Location (un) 239**] J
   - f/u c-spine
 read was negative for fx

   - f/u read on repeat CT
 no new changes
   -CXR shows R humeral head fracture
 d/w ortho old fx, no issues,
   shoulder immobilizer
   -Ortho consult. Ordered Shoulder X-ray, shouder in sling
   #. Resp: Was intubated on AC with good O2 sats.
   -          weaned propofol off but remained solmulent.
   -          RSBI 36 this am, once MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 619**] CPAP, extubated
