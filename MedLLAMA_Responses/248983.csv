   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - recheck INR in afternoon, consider restarting coumadin if INR
   decreased <2.3, once bleed stabilized.
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam difficult to
   assess for expansion of hematoma.
   - recheck Hct now, then noon Hct
   - monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma,
   monitor vitals (BP, HR)
   - tranfuse today if Hct < 30 due to active bleeding
   - repeat CT scan to make sure hematoma is not enlarging and f/u final
   read of CT abdomen/pelvis from yesterday
   - Pain control with Tylenol #3
   - Check afternoon Coags; if INR<2.3, and bleed stabilized, consider
   restarting coumadin
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   - monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - resolved
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated
   .
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.
   .
   #FEN: Cardiac Heart healthy diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female who underwent atrial fibrillation ablation procedure yesterday. She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The procedure resulted in a large pelvic hematoma, which was managed with 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her hemoglobin level increased from 29.4 to 31.9, but her hematocrit did not increase appropriately, indicating continued bleeding. She is currently in sinus rhythm, with an INR of 2.8.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.5°F, blood pressure of 131/64 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Her physical examination is notable for a tender abdomen to palpation over the left lower quadrant, 3-4 cm below the umbilicus.

The patient is receiving sotalol 120mg PO daily, and her INR will be rechecked in the afternoon. She is also receiving ranitidine 150mg PO daily for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) prophylaxis. Her hyperlipidemia is stable and not currently being treated with statins.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the pelvic hematoma: The patient's hematocrit did not increase appropriately, indicating continued bleeding. Close monitoring of her vital signs and physical examination is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding or expansion of the hematoma.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 178 K/uL, which is low. Close monitoring of her platelet count and bleeding risk is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension during the procedure and was treated with neosynephrine. Close monitoring of her blood pressure is necessary to detect any signs of hypotension.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the pelvic hematoma and the use of invasive lines and devices. Close monitoring of her vital signs and physical examination is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias due to the atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. Close monitoring of her electrocardiogram and vital signs is necessary to detect any signs of arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant therapy and the presence of a pelvic hematoma. Close monitoring of her vital signs and physical examination is necessary to detect any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   - Recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Recheck INR in afternoon, restart coumadin if INR decreased <2.3,
   once bleed stabilized
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam indicates no
   expansion, of hematoma suggesting stablization.
   - f/u Hct at 9am, then noon Hct
   -Monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Pain control with Tylenol #3
   - Check afternoon Coags; if INR<2.3,  and bleed stabilized, may restart
   coumadin
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   -Monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   -strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - monitor hemodynamics
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated
   .
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female who underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure (PVI) and developed a large pelvic hematoma. She was started on sotalol and coumadin, but the coumadin was held due to an elevated INR of 2.8. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) initially decreased from 29.4 to 36.0, but subsequent labs showed a Hct of 31.9, suggesting continued bleeding. The patient's pelvic hematoma is stable, and she is being monitored for signs of bleeding or expansion. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a preserved EF>60%, and she is being monitored for signs of cardiac overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's continued bleeding despite the initial transfusion of 2 units of PRBC may lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock, anemia, or organ failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac overload may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's pelvic hematoma and potential bleeding may increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Thrombotic complications: The patient's therapeutic INR on coumadin may increase the risk of thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GERD and potential bleeding may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen the patient's anemia and increase the risk of complications.
6. Renal complications: The patient's potential bleeding and anemia may increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's potential bleeding and anemia may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for signs of bleeding, cardiac complications, infection, thrombotic complications, gastrointestinal complications, renal complications, and respiratory complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - recheck INR in afternoon, consider restarting coumadin if INR
   decreased <2.3, once bleed stabilized.
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam difficult to
   assess for expansion of hematoma.
   - recheck Hct now, then noon Hct
   - monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma,
   monitor vitals (BP, HR)
   - tranfuse today if Hct < 30 due to active bleeding
   - repeat CT scan to make sure hematoma is not enlarging and f/u final
   read of CT abdomen/pelvis from yesterday
   - Pain control with Tylenol #3
   - Check afternoon Coags; if INR<2.3, and bleed stabilized, consider
   restarting coumadin
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   - monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - resolved
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated
   .
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female who underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure yesterday. She was found to have a large pelvic hematoma, which was managed with blood transfusions and close monitoring. She is currently in sinus rhythm and is therapeutic on coumadin with an INR of 2.8. Her hemoglobin level is 31.9, which is slightly lower than expected after transfusions. She is at risk for continued bleeding and expansion of the hematoma. The patient is being monitored closely for signs of bleeding or expansion of the hematoma, and her hemoglobin level will be rechecked regularly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the pelvic hematoma: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly lower than expected after transfusions, suggesting that she may still be bleeding. This could lead to further complications, such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
2. Expansion of the pelvic hematoma: The patient's pelvic hematoma is large and may continue to expand, which could lead to compression of surrounding structures, such as the bladder, rectum, or bowel.
3. Thromboembolic complications: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), due to her prolonged immobility and use of coumadin.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation ablation procedure may have caused cardiac complications, such as heart block or arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest or death.
5. Infection: The patient's pelvic hematoma may become infected, leading to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged immobility and restricted diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies, which could compromise her immune system and increase her risk of complications.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat any complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who underwent a PVI procedure and developed a large pelvic hematoma. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has been decreasing, and she has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission. The patient's INR is 1.8, which is below the therapeutic range. The patient's pain has been controlled with oxycodone and hydrocodone. The patient's physical examination is unchanged from admission, with the exception of a slight increase in abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding into the pelvic hematoma: The patient's Hct has decreased despite receiving 6 units of PRBCs, and her INR is below the therapeutic range, which may indicate ongoing bleeding into the hematoma.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, which may increase the risk of thrombosis, particularly in the setting of recent atrial ablation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension, which may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Infection: The patient has a pelvic hematoma, which may increase her risk of infection.
5. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's Hct has decreased significantly, which may indicate hypovolemic shock, particularly if her blood pressure is not well-compensated.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which may increase her risk of pulmonary embolism.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure or compromise.

Plan:

1. Monitor the patient's Hct and transfuse PRBCs as needed to maintain a hemoglobin level above 30.
2. Restart coumadin once the patient's bleeding has stabilized and her Hct is stable.
3. Continue monitoring the patient's INR and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's physical examination for signs of worsening bleeding or infection.
5. Continue pain control with hydrocodone and monitor the patient's pain level.
6. Consider consulting a vascular or interventional radiology specialist if the patient's bleeding does not improve.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider restarting sotalol at a lower dose if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure in setting of
   therapeutic INR on coumadin. Expanded in size from 12x 5 cm
  14.7 x
   6.8cm on CT wet read  yesterday late morning (~20% increase),
   indicating continued bleeding. 2 units PRBC and Vit K given early
   afternoon, Hct bumped ~3.6 points to 32.8, but 9pm labs showed Hct
   28.1. Transfused another 2 units last night, 3am Hct of 34.3, which may
   be too early to reflect Hct after equilibration. If morning Hct comes
   down below 32.1, likely she has continuing bleeding into hematoma in
   setting of elevated INR. Total Units given =6 this hospital admission.
   - recheck 7:30 Hct, follow serial Hct
s q 6 hours
   - monitor physical exam for increasing abdominal distension, monitor
   vitals (BP, HR)
   - transfuse today if Hct < 30 due to active bleeding.
   -If active bleeding continues, get Vascular or IR consult
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis from yesterday
   - Pain control with Oxycodone
   - Check morning Coags; last INR 1.8 <2.0; consider restarting coumadin
   to prevent thrombosis when Hct stable
   - Check Lactate secondary to severe tenderness.
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient has
   been stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt
s INR 1.8<2.0, below
   therapeutic range on coumadin; should be therapeutic to prevent
   thrombosis in setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Restart coumadin once bleeding stabilized.
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   - monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with abdominal/pelvic pain and a large pelvic hematoma following a PVI procedure. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is 123/51 mmHg, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula oxygen.
* Hemoglobin level: The patient's hemoglobin level has increased from 28.1% to 34.3% after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells.
* INR: The patient's INR is 1.8, which is below the therapeutic range of 2.0. This is a concern as it may indicate ongoing bleeding into the pelvic hematoma.
* Pain control: The patient is receiving oxycodone 5-10mg q4h prn for pain control.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,800 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with a total output of 770 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 14.9, hemoglobin level is 36.0, platelet count is 178, and creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Continued bleeding into the pelvic hematoma: The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, and her hemoglobin level has increased only slightly after receiving packed red blood cells. This suggests that she may still be bleeding into the hematoma.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, which may increase the risk of thrombosis.
3. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, but she has received a significant amount of fluids. If she continues to bleed, she may develop hypovolemic shock.
4. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her prolonged immobility and the presence of a pelvic hematoma.

The plan for the patient's care is as follows:

1. Recheck the patient's hemoglobin level every 6 hours to monitor for continued bleeding.
2. Monitor the patient's physical exam for signs of increasing abdominal distension and monitor her vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate.
3. Transfuse the patient if her hemoglobin level falls below 30 due to active bleeding.
4. Consult with vascular or interventional radiology if the patient's bleeding continues.
5. Restart the patient's coumadin once her bleeding has stabilized to prevent thrombosis.
6. Monitor the patient's lactate level due to her severe tenderness.
7. Continue the patient's pain control with oxycodone.
8. Restart the patient's coumadin once her bleeding has stabilized to prevent thrombosis.
9. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely for signs of hypovolemic shock."

   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding ongoing with Hcts continuing to drop slowly
   in setting of elevated but not therapeutic INR. 1 unit PRBC given
   overnight, Hct bumped from 28.0 to 31.6 this morning, showing
   appropriate increase; possibly indicates decreased bleeding. Normal
   lactate indicates no abdominal ischemia. Total Units given =7 this
   hospital admission.
   - follow serial Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding ongoing with Hcts continuing to drop slowly
   in setting of elevated but not therapeutic INR. 1 unit PRBC given
   overnight, Hct bumped from 28.0 to 31.6 this morning, showing
   appropriate increase; possibly indicates decreased bleeding. Normal
   lactate indicates no abdominal ischemia. Total Units given =7 this
   hospital admission.
   - follow serial Hct
s q 6 hours
   - transfuse again if Hct < 30 indicating active bleeding.
   -If active bleeding continues, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - monitor physical exam for increasing abdominal distension, monitor
   vitals (BP, HR)
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Pain control with Oxycodone
   - Check Coags; last INR 1.3 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent
   thrombosis per EP recs
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient has
   been stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and Pt having occasional
   PACs since this morning. Pt
s INR 1.3<2.0, below therapeutic range on
   coumadin; continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent
   thrombosis in setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Continue coumadin unless bleeding increased.
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears hypervolemic, evidence of
   overload on exam w/ bibasilar crackles, subjective SOB. UOP with 10mg
   IV lasix was good. Likely due to 7units of blood given.
   -If continues with crackles, give additional 10mg IV bolus of lasix
   - Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with a large pelvic hematoma and was treated with blood transfusions and lasix boluses. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been trending downward, but have stabilized at 31.6% after receiving additional blood transfusions. Her lactate levels are normal, indicating no abdominal ischemia.

The patient's rhythm has been stable in sinus rhythm since the PVI procedure, with occasional premature atrial contractions (PACs). Her INR is 1.3, which is below the therapeutic range, and she is being continued on coumadin to achieve a therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis.

The patient appears hypervolemic, with evidence of overload on exam and subjective shortness of breath (SOB). She has been treated with IV lasix and is being monitored for signs of overload.

The patient's electrolytes are slightly depleted, and she is being repleted with potassium and magnesium supplements. Her blood pressure is controlled on medications, and she is being monitored for signs of hypertension.

The patient's current medications include coumadin, ranitidine, and sotalol. She is being followed for signs of bleeding, and her Hct levels will be monitored every 6 hours. She is also being monitored for signs of abdominal distension, vital signs, and pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's Hct levels are still trending downward, and she may require additional blood transfusions to stabilize her hemoglobin levels.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, and she is at risk for developing thrombosis if not adequately anticoagulated.
3. Heart failure: The patient's hypervolemic state and evidence of overload on exam suggest that she may be at risk for developing heart failure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's bilateral crackles on exam and subjective SOB suggest that she may be at risk for developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and her current use of ranitidine suggest that she may be at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's slightly depleted electrolyte levels suggest that she may be at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted with a large pelvic hematoma. She has been receiving blood transfusions and has been stable in sinus rhythm after a procedure for atrial fibrillation. However, her hematocrit (Hct) has been trending downward, and she has been given additional units of blood overnight. Her lactate levels are normal, indicating no abdominal ischemia.

The patient has been experiencing increasing abdominal distension, and her blood pressure has been elevated. She has been receiving lasix to treat her symptoms, and her urine output has been good. Her potassium and magnesium levels are slightly depleted, and she is being repleted with IV magnesium and potassium.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and she is being treated with medications to control her hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. She is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the pelvic hematoma, which could lead to further drops in Hct and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hypervolemia, which could lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
3. Depletion of potassium and magnesium, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Atrial fibrillation, which could lead to stroke or other cardiovascular complications.
5. Hyperlipidemia, which could lead to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's Hct and transfuse additional units of blood as needed to prevent further bleeding.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication regimen as needed to control her hypertension.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium and magnesium levels and replete as needed to prevent depletion.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her medication regimen as needed to control her symptoms.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperlipidemia and adjust her medication regimen as needed to control her symptoms.
6. Consider consulting with a vascular or interventional radiology specialist if the patient's bleeding persists or worsens.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist if the patient's atrial fibrillation persists or worsens.
8. Consider consulting with a nephrologist if the patient's kidney function is compromised due to hypervolemia or other factors."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding appears stable with Hcts continuing in low
   30
s; slight drop this a.m. to 29.8, but has been stable throughout day
   yesterday.  INR up to 1.9, increasing risk for rebleeding. Total Units
   given =7 this hospital admission.
   - check Hct at 2pm today, then follow serial Hct
s as indicated
   - transfuse again if Hct < 27 indicating active bleeding, one unit
   RBCs, with lasix
   - Decrease Coumadin to 5mg po daily as INR approaching therapeutic
   level
   - If active bleeding restarts, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - Pain control with Oxycodone PRN
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   continues to be stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and  occasional
   PACs. Pt
s INR 1.9<2.0, just below therapeutic range on coumadin;
   continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis in
   setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs. Ask for recs
   re: home dosing of sotalol.
   - ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - last INR 1.9 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent thrombosis, but
   decrease dose to 5mg q day
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt still appears hypervolemic w/ JVD
   [**12-3**], but sx decreased since yesterday; no continued subjective SOB.
   UOP with 10mg IV lasix x2 yesterday was good. Overload likely result of
   7units of blood given.
   - If O2 sats drop <93%, give another 10mg IV lasix
   - Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, with goal of  down 500mL, daily weights
   .
   #L THIGH NUMBNESS: Pt describes numbness on L lateral thigh, which is
   similar to a previous sensation during episode of back pain.
   Distribution is L lateral cutaneous nerve/L2-L3. In setting of
   decreased INR over previous few days and risk of thrombosis due to L
   atrial ablation procedure, must consider thrombosis as etiology.
   However, considering no other signs of thromosis, no pain, good pulses,
   warm extremities, no skin changes, this is unlikely thrombotic event.
   Considering previous episode and specific nerve distribution, more
   likely nerve impingement vs sciatic sx.
   -continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding appears stable with Hcts continuing in low
   30
s; slight drop this a.m. to 29.8, but has been stable throughout day
   yesterday.  INR up to 1.9, increasing risk for rebleeding. Total Units
   given =7 this hospital admission.
   - check Hct at 2pm today, then follow serial Hct
s as indicated
   - transfuse again if Hct < 27 indicating active bleeding, one unit
   RBCs, with lasix
   - Decrease Coumadin to 5mg po daily as INR approaching therapeutic
   level
   - If active bleeding restarts, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - Pain control with Oxycodone PRN
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   continues to be stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and  occasional
   PACs. Pt
s INR 1.9<2.0, just below therapeutic range on coumadin;
   continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis in
   setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs. Ask for recs
   re: home dosing of sotalol.
   - ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - last INR 1.9 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent thrombosis, but
   decrease dose to 5mg q day
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt still appears hypervolemic w/ JVD
   [**12-3**], but sx decreased since yesterday; no continued subjective SOB.
   UOP with 10mg IV lasix x2 yesterday was good. Overload likely result of
   7units of blood given.
   - If O2 sats drop <93%, give another 10mg IV lasix
   - Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, with goal of  down 500mL, daily weights
   .
   #L THIGH NUMBNESS: Pt describes numbness on L lateral thigh, which is
   similar to a previous sensation during episode of back pain.
   Distribution is L lateral cutaneous nerve/L2-L3. In setting of
   decreased INR over previous few days and risk of thrombosis due to L
   atrial ablation procedure, must consider thrombosis as etiology.
   However, considering no other signs of thromosis, no pain, good pulses,
   warm extremities, no skin changes, this is unlikely thrombotic event.
   Considering previous episode and specific nerve distribution, more
   likely nerve impingement vs sciatic sx.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently BP
s in 110-130
s, controlled on meds.
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   # Constipation: 1 BM achieved; colon not obstructed by hematoma
   - Continue bowel regimen w/ miralax.
   -Increased time OOB, PT consult today
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with increasing palpitations. She had a large pelvic hematoma and underwent a pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, with a current level of 29.8%. Her INR is 1.9, which is increasing the risk of rebleeding.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft and tender abdomen, with no signs of ascites or organomegaly. Her extremities are warm and have good pulses. She has numbness on her left lateral thigh, which is similar to a previous episode of back pain. The numbness is likely caused by nerve impingement rather than thrombosis.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.7, a platelet count of 132, and a creatinine level of 0.5. Her liver function tests are within normal limits. Her electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's medications include Coumadin, sotalol, ranitidine, and lasix. She is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring her hemoglobin levels and transfusing blood if necessary
* Decreasing her Coumadin dose to 5mg daily
* Continuing her sotalol at a lower dose
* Monitoring her electrolyte levels and adjusting her medications as necessary
* Continuing her prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer
* Monitoring her numbness on her left lateral thigh and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Rebleeding due to the patient's low hemoglobin levels and increasing INR
* Thrombosis due to the patient's atrial ablation procedure and decreasing INR
* Nerve damage due to the patient's numbness on her left lateral thigh
* Infection due to the patient's indwelling catheters and lines
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding appears stable with Hcts continuing in low
   30
s; slight drop this a.m. to 29.8, but has been stable throughout day
   yesterday.  INR up to 1.9, increasing risk for rebleeding. Total Units
   given =7 this hospital admission.
   -continue to follow serial Hct
s q 6 hours
   - transfuse again if Hct < 27 indicating active bleeding, one unit
   RBCs, with lasix
   -If active bleeding restarts, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - Pain control with Oxycodone PRN
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   continues to be stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and  occasional
   PACs. Pt
s INR 1.9<2.0, just below therapeutic range on coumadin;
   continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis in
   setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs. Ask for recs
   re: home dosing of sotalol.
   - ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - last INR 1.9 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent thrombosis, but
   decrease dose to 5mg q day
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt still appears hypervolemic w/ JVD
   [**12-3**], but sx decreased since yesterday; no continued subjective SOB.
   UOP with 10mg IV lasix x2 yesterday was good. Overload likely result of
   7units of blood given.
   - If O2 sats drop <93%, give another 10mg IV lasix
   - Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, with goal of  down 500mL, daily weights
   .
   #L THIGH NUMBNESS: Pt describes numbness on L lateral thigh, which is
   similar to a previous sensation during episode of back pain.
   Distribution is L lateral cutaneous nerve/L2-L3. In setting of
   decreased INR over previous few days and risk of thrombosis due to L
   atrial ablation procedure, must consider thrombosis as etiology.
   However, considering no other signs of thromosis, no pain, good pulses,
   warm extremities, no skin changes, this is unlikely thrombotic event.
   Considering previous episode and specific nerve distribution, more
   likely nerve impingement vs sciatic sx.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently BP
s in 110-130
s, controlled on meds.
   # GERD: not currently active.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of a large pelvic hematoma and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/54 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m², and her central venous pressure is 12-3 cm. Her fluid balance is -1530 mL, indicating a significant amount of fluid removal.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 29.8%, and platelet count of 132 K/μL. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.9 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 30.6 seconds.

The patient's physical examination is notable for numbness on the left lateral thigh, which is similar to a previous sensation during an episode of back pain. The numbness is likely related to nerve impingement rather than thrombosis.

The patient's medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She has undergone a percutaneous pulmonary valve insertion (PVI) procedure, and her INR is slightly elevated.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to detect any signs of active bleeding.
2. Transfusion of red blood cells if the hemoglobin level falls below 27 g/dL.
3. Pain control with oxycodone as needed.
4. Continuation of warfarin therapy to achieve a therapeutic INR.
5. Monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate.
6. Strict fluid management to prevent overload.
7. Monitoring of the patient's neurological status, including the numbness on the left lateral thigh.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Rebleeding from the pelvic hematoma.
2. Thrombosis, particularly in the setting of decreased INR and risk of thrombosis due to the atrial ablation procedure.
3. Overload due to excessive fluid administration.
4. Nerve damage or compression due to the numbness on the left lateral thigh.
5. Infection, particularly in the setting of prolonged ICU stay.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."
