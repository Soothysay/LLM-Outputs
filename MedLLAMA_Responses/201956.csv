You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, specifically colon cancer, who is currently in the ICU with a variety of medical complications. The patient has a pulmonary embolism (PE), altered mental status, sepsis, and tachypnea, which may be due to pneumonia or other causes. He also has metastatic carcinoma, bacterial peritonitis, and abdominal distension. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's tachypnea may be due to pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic picture may lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Metastatic carcinoma: The patient's metastatic disease may spread to other organs, including the brain, liver, and bones, which could lead to further complications.
5. Bacterial peritonitis: The patient's bacterial peritonitis may lead to further infection and sepsis, which could worsen his condition.
6. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdominal distension may worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver failure may worsen his condition and increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
8. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen his condition and increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen his condition and increase the risk of fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
10. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may worsen his condition and increase the risk of muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of cancer and is at risk of developing PE, which can be exacerbated by the presence of a central venous line and the patient's immobility.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic picture, despite being on antibiotics, suggests a high risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status, tachypnea, and hypotension may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be caused by liver failure or portosystemic shunting.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea, decreased lung volume, and hypoxia may suggest respiratory failure, which can be caused by pneumonia, PE, or other underlying conditions.
5. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's distant heart sounds, low voltage, and hypotension may indicate cardiac tamponade, which can be caused by tumor compression or invasion of the pericardium.
6. Metastatic Carcinoma: The patient's extensive disease and poor functional status suggest that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, which can lead to further complications and poor outcomes.
7. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient's peritoneal fluid culture showing coag-negative staph suggests the presence of bacterial peritonitis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
8. Abdominal Distension: The patient's abdominal distension and hypotension may be caused by fluid shift or ascites, which can lead to respiratory compromise and further complications.
9. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and decreased albumin suggest liver failure, which can be caused by cancer, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be caused by iron deficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other underlying conditions, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications.
11. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may be caused by hypoalbuminemia, hypomagnesemia, or other underlying conditions, which can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and other symptoms.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to monitor their progress closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assesment: This is a 62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca
   who presents with persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic
   picture despite on antibiotics
   Plan:
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # tachypnea: In 40
s this morning,  of proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.

   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. The pt has never met Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] before. Given extent of
   disease and poor functional status treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX)
   would be palliative.   Give overall poor prognosis, no further efforts
   for definitive diagnosis are indicated

   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough 17.9, goal 15-20, continue current dosing regimen
   # Abdominal Distension: Pt had 4.5L removed on [**3-1**], got 50gm albumin.
   Hypotension could be due to fluid shift.
   - albumin given, 50 g
   - IVF
   # Liver failure: Could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   - no indication to check ammonia level as does not correlate with level
   of hepatic encephalopahty
   - can give lactulose PR, will hold off on NGT placement pending family
   meeting regarding goals of care
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of cancer and is at risk for developing pneumonia, which is further exacerbated by his septic picture and tachypnea.
2. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is increasing, and he has a fever, which indicates a high risk of developing sepsis. His hypotension and tachypnea also suggest a high risk of developing septic shock.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's tachypnea and hypotension are consistent with a diagnosis of PE. His history of cancer and recent paracentesis also increase his risk of developing PE.
4. Tamponade: The patient's distant heart sounds and low voltage on his EKG suggest a possibility of tamponade, which could be caused by his cancer or other medical conditions.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated bilirubin levels suggest a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which could be caused by his liver failure or other medical conditions.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely caused by his cancer and malnutrition.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is likely caused by his hypoalbuminemia and poor GI absorption.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation is likely caused by his opioid requirements and may be exacerbated by his hypocalcemia.
9. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely caused by his prerenal hypovolemia, possibly due to his sepsis or other medical conditions.
10. Type I Diabetes: The patient's Type I diabetes is likely causing his hyperglycemia, which is further exacerbated by his impaired hepatic function.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic gastrointestinal malignancy, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and new right-sided infiltrate. The patient's condition is likely attributed to the evolution of renal failure, persistent mild hypernatremia, and significant volume shifts resulting in hypotension. The patient has a new right-sided infiltrate, which may be related to pulmonary infection or pneumonitis, driving acute changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is consistent with sepsis, and the pulmonary source of infection is a concern.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism due to renal failure and the need for anticoagulation therapy.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be related to hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction.
4. Metabolic Abnormalities: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia, may contribute to his altered mental status.
5. Infection: The patient's new right-sided infiltrate may be related to pulmonary infection or pneumonitis, which needs to be treated promptly.
6. Tamponade: The patient's hypotension may be related to cardiac tamponade, which needs to be ruled out with an echocardiogram.
7. Cancer Progression: The patient's malignancy is progressing, and further treatment options need to be discussed with the oncology team.
8. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with significant volume shifts, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment of the patient's underlying infection with antibiotics.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Consider the use of lactulose to treat hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider the use of echocardiogram to rule out tamponade.
6. Discuss further treatment options with the oncology team.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca
   who presents with persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic
   picture despite on antibiotics
   Plan:
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # tachypnea: In 40
s this morning,  of proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. The pt has never met Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] before. Given extent of
   disease and poor functional status treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX)
   would be palliative.   Give overall poor prognosis, no further efforts
   for definitive diagnosis are indicated
   - plan for family meeting and discussion of goal of care this afternoon
   - palliative care consult recs
   - currently full code
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough 17.9, goal 15-20, continue current dosing regimen
   # Abdominal Distension: Pt had 4.5L removed on [**3-1**], got 50gm albumin.
   Hypotension could be due to fluid shift.
   - albumin given, 50 g
   - IVF
   # Liver failure: Could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   - no indication to check ammonia level as does not correlate with level
   of hepatic encephalopahty
   - can give lactulose PR, will hold off on NGT placement pending family
   meeting regarding goals of care
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal
   - UA and lytes
   - fluids
   - albumin
   # Anemia: iron deficiency most likely as hypochromic, microcytic and
   thrombocytosis. most likely due to gi loss or poor iron absorbtion. no
   po iron for now to avoid further constipation.
   -iron studies, b12 folate,  retic count pending
   # Hypocalcemia:6.9  last night, this morning is pending.  Partly
   uncorrected due to hypoalbuminemia, possible contribution to to poor GI
   absorption
   - trend
   # FEN:  IVF, npo for now
   # Access : peripheral, consider central line if further hypotensive
   hypoxic needing intubation
 however would hold off on line placement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca who presents with
   persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite on
   antibiotics, now made CMO after family discussion with his oncologist.
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. Given extent of disease and poor functional status
   treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX) would be palliative.   Give overall
   poor prognosis, no further efforts for definitive diagnosis are
   indicated.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**], his oncologist met with him and his family
   yesterday and stated that chemo was not indicated in his case and he
   was made CMO.
   - Morphine prn for SOB or pain
   - F/u palliative care consult recs
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # tachypnea: In 40
s this morning,  of proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough 17.9, goal 15-20, continue current dosing regimen
   # Liver failure: Could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   - no indication to check ammonia level as does not correlate with level
   of hepatic encephalopahty
   - can give lactulose PR, will hold off on NGT placement pending family
   meeting regarding goals of care
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal
   - UA and lytes
   - fluids
   - albumin
   # Anemia: iron deficiency most likely as hypochromic, microcytic and
   thrombocytosis. most likely due to gi loss or poor iron absorbtion. no
   po iron for now to avoid further constipation.
   -iron studies, b12 folate,  retic count pending

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough 17.9, goal 15-20, continue current dosing regimen
   # Liver failure: Could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   - no indication to check ammonia level as does not correlate with level
   of hepatic encephalopahty
   - can give lactulose PR, will hold off on NGT placement pending family
   meeting regarding goals of care
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal
   - UA and lytes
   - fluids
   - albumin
   # Anemia: iron deficiency most likely as hypochromic, microcytic and
   thrombocytosis. most likely due to gi loss or poor iron absorbtion. no
   po iron for now to avoid further constipation.
   -iron studies, b12 folate,  retic count pending

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic carcinoma, likely colonic primary, and is currently in the ICU with a poor prognosis. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is increasing, and he has a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), which may indicate sepsis. The patient's hypotension, tachypnea, and low blood pressure may also be indicative of sepsis.
2. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient's peritoneal fluid WBC count is 700 (70P/9L), which is indicative of bacterial peritonitis. The patient's peritoneal culture showed coag-negative staph, which may require further treatment.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver failure. The patient's lactulose treatment may help to manage his symptoms, but further monitoring is needed.
4. Type I Diabetes: The patient's glucose level is 244 mg/dL, which is high. The patient's Lantus medication may help to manage his blood sugar levels, but further monitoring is needed.
5. Constipation: The patient's opiod medication may be causing constipation, which may require further treatment.
6. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate ARF. The patient's hypotension, sepsis, and hypovolemia may also contribute to ARF.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to iron deficiency, which may require further treatment.
8. Tamponade: The patient's distant heart sounds and low voltage may indicate tamponade, which may require further evaluation.
9. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate pulmonary embolism, which may require further evaluation.

In terms of the patient's current treatment plan, the patient is receiving morphine for pain and comfort measures only. He is also receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage of bacterial infections. The patient's lactulose treatment may help to manage his symptoms, and he is being monitored for signs of liver failure. The patient's blood sugar levels are being monitored, and he is receiving Lantus medication to help manage his diabetes. The patient's constipation is being managed with senna and lactulose. The patient's anemia is being monitored, and he is receiving iron studies, B12, folate, and retic count pending.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca who presents with
   persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite on
   antibiotics, now made [**Year (4 digits) 115**] after family discussion with his oncologist.
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. Given extent of disease and poor functional status
   treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX) would be palliative.   Give overall
   poor prognosis, no further efforts for definitive diagnosis are
   indicated.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**], his oncologist met with him and his family
   yesterday and stated that chemo was not indicated in his case and he
   was made [**Last Name (STitle) 115**].
   - Morphine prn for SOB or pain
   - F/u palliative care consult recs
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory status/Aspiration PNA: The patient was tachypneic
   yesterday to the 40
s this morning, out proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP, however zosyn was restarted on
   zosyn to further cover bowel flora (possible gi ca) and other gram
   negatives.  Were stopped yesterday while [**Last Name (LF) 115**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] be restarted today.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn.  Will checl vanc levels given her ARF.
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Continue lantus 7 units and SSI.
   # Constipation: Patient had a bm this am.
   - Continue colace and senna prn
   # ARF: Cr increased to 2.0 this am; (baseline Cr is 1.1-1.2).  Given
   his hypotension yesterday, likely prerenal vs ATN.
   - Continue to follow
   # Anemia:  Hct stable this am at 28.7 (from 24.6).  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding, although with possible colon cancer, may have a
   chronic slow GI bleed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Guaiac stools

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca who presents with
   persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite on
   antibiotics, now made [**Year (4 digits) 115**] after family discussion with his oncologist.
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. Given extent of disease and poor functional status
   treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX) would be palliative.   Give overall
   poor prognosis, no further efforts for definitive diagnosis are
   indicated.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**], his oncologist met with him and his family
   yesterday and stated that chemo was not indicated in his case and he
   was made [**Last Name (STitle) 115**].
   - Morphine prn for SOB or pain
   - F/u palliative care consult recs
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory status/Aspiration PNA: The patient was tachypneic
   yesterday to the 40
s this morning, out proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP, however zosyn was restarted on
   zosyn to further cover bowel flora (possible gi ca) and other gram
   negatives.  Were stopped yesterday while [**Last Name (LF) 115**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] be restarted today.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn.  Will checl vanc levels given her ARF.
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Continue lantus 7 units and SSI.
   # Constipation: Patient had a bm this am.
   - Continue colace and senna prn
   # ARF: Cr increased to 2.0 this am; (baseline Cr is 1.1-1.2).  Given
   his hypotension yesterday, likely prerenal vs ATN.
   - Continue to follow
   # Anemia:  Hct stable this am at 28.7 (from 24.6).  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding, although with possible colon cancer, may have a
   chronic slow GI bleed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Guaiac stools

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca who presents with
   persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite on
   antibiotics, now made [**Year (4 digits) 115**] after family discussion with his oncologist.
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. Given extent of disease and poor functional status
   treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX) would be palliative.   Give overall
   poor prognosis, no further efforts for definitive diagnosis are
   indicated.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**], his oncologist met with him and his family
   yesterday and stated that chemo was not indicated in his case and he
   was made [**Last Name (STitle) 115**].  This morning given his clinical improvement, he and his
   wife have decided to reverse the [**Name (NI) 115**] and want to know if chemo would be
   an option at this time.
   - Will communicate the change in status with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] and have him meet
   with the patient to discuss chemo options.
   - Morphine prn for SOB or pain
   - F/u palliative care consult recs
   # Delerium:  Resolved, the patient was alert and oriented this am.
   Head CT was negative.  His delirium was likely secondary to his recent
   infection vs aspiration vs medication effecct.
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs.  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Was hypotensive to 80
s yesterday, however
   his SBPs have been improving and his WBC is trending downward.
   - Will obtain a PICC for access and remove his central line once
   placed.
   - continue IV fluids prn for fluid depletion.
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory status/Aspiration PNA/Hx of PE: The patient was
   tachypneic yesterday to the 40
s this morning, however his respiratory
   distress resolved and he has been breathing comfortably on 2 L.
   Patient was thought to have aspirated and has been on vanc and zosyn.
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP, however zosyn was restarted on
   zosyn to further cover bowel flora (possible gi ca) and other gram
   negatives.  Were stopped yesterday while [**Last Name (LF) 115**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] be restarted today.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn.  Will checl vanc levels given her ARF.
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Continue lantus 7 units and SSI.
   # Constipation: Patient had a bm this am.
   - Continue colace and senna prn
   # ARF: Cr increased to 2.0 this am; (baseline Cr is 1.1-1.2).  Given
   his hypotension yesterday, likely prerenal vs ATN.
   - Continue to follow
   # Anemia:  Hct stable this am at 28.7 (from 24.6).  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding, although with possible colon cancer, may have a
   chronic slow GI bleed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Guaiac stools

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, specifically metastatic colon cancer, who has been admitted to the ICU with poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture.
* The patient's condition has improved, with his mental status clearing and his blood pressure improving.
* The patient and his wife have decided to reverse his do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and want to know if chemotherapy is an option at this time.
* The patient has a PICC line in place, and his central line will be removed once the PICC line is placed.
* The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and bowel flora.
* The patient has a history of type I diabetes and is being monitored for hypoglycemia in the setting of impaired hepatic function.
* The patient has a history of constipation and is being treated with colace and senna as needed.
* The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and is being monitored for progression.
* The patient has anemia and is being monitored for any signs of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Sepsis: The patient's septic picture has improved, but he is still at risk for sepsis due to his underlying cancer and infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress has resolved, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying cancer and infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF is being monitored, and he may be at risk for further progression.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of colon cancer and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient has type I diabetes and is being monitored for hypoglycemia in the setting of impaired hepatic function.
* Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation and may be at risk for further complications if not managed properly.
* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia and may be at risk for further complications if not managed properly.
* Bacterial peritonitis: The patient has a history of bacterial peritonitis and may be at risk for further complications if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with wide spread likely colon cancer now with decision made
   for no chemotherapy offered patient did have clinical decline and when
   faced with possible intubation decision made to pursue patient
   treatment plan as comfort measures only.  In that setting he had
   substantial improvement clinically with comfort care only.  We have
   readdressed the issues given his excellent improvement overnight with
   patient and his wife and will move to DNR/DNI status only.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Will continue to treat with Vanco/Zosyn for likely pulmonary source
   and peritoneal site
   -Follow up labs this am
   -BP has much improved
   2)PE-
   -Has had PE in past and raised as concern with acute chagned
   3)Respiratory Distress/Aspiration Pneumonia-
   -Will have speech and swallow to eval for strategies for minimization
   of aspiration events.  Significant aspiration was seen in the setting
   of severely altered mental status.
   -Continue Vanco/Zosyn
   4)Metastatic Malignancy
Likley colon CA
   -Further follow up evaluation and care per Onc team

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   faced with possible intubation decision made to pursue patient
   treatment plan as comfort measures only.  In that setting he had
   substantial improvement clinically with comfort care only.  We have
   readdressed the issues given his excellent improvement overnight with
   patient and his wife and will move to DNR/DNI status only.

   -Has had PE in past and raised as concern with acute chagned
   3)Respiratory Distress/Aspiration Pneumonia-
   -Will have speech and swallow to eval for strategies for minimization
   of aspiration events.  Significant aspiration was seen in the setting
   of severely altered mental status.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a wide-spread likely colon cancer, currently in the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F) and 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 91 bpm (81-102 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/60 mmHg (71-136/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (20-30 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse and left radial pulse not assessed
* Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, dullness, and diminished breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft and distended
* Extremities: Right and left extremities with 1+ edema
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement and tone not assessed

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 100 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02
* Glucose: 244 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis: Continue treatment with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for likely pulmonary and peritoneal sources
* Pulmonary embolism: Considered, but not confirmed
* Respiratory distress/aspiration pneumonia: Continue Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and evaluate for strategies to minimize aspiration events
* Metastatic malignancy: Further evaluation and care per Oncology team
* Comfort care: Continue comfort measures only, and move to DNR/DNI status

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: Continued infection and septic shock
* Pulmonary embolism: Acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, or death
* Respiratory distress/aspiration pneumonia: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, or death
* Metastatic malignancy: Progressive disease, pain, and poor quality of life

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
