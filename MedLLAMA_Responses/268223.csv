   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - Vent settings on ARDSnet protocol, pt oxygenating well
   - titrating down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerating
   - increased P02 after increased hydral dosage, consistant with CHF
   contributing to hypoxia, titrated hdryal up to 15 q8h. However d/ced
   hydralazine while getting CVVHD since BP dropping.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc while on CVVHD
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continues to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx yesterday
   - minimal sedation to avoid hypotension
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   - CVVHD has been intermittent [**3-11**] line issues, yesterday pulled LIJ and
   placed femoral, now running well. Goal i/o -2L
   - 5of peep, will get RSBI 87 this am, doing well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt
   extubation later today. However concerned given pt's high minute
   ventalation.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to maximize
   diuresis
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol prophylaxis held to increase BP while on CVVHD
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.4, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG consistantly elevated
   -discontinue Glargine + HISS.
   -started insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   -HRS meds stoped
   - Poor UO with lasix and diuril
   - on CVVHD diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -2L today
   -monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of fxn
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro at new renal dosages
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso.  Will d/c
   abx, as may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - Vent settings on ARDSnet protocol, pt oxygenating well
   - titrating down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerating
   - increased P02 after increased hydral dosage, consistant with CHF
   contributing to hypoxia, titrated hdryal up to 15 q8h. However d/ced
   hydralazine while getting CVVHD since BP dropping.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc while on CVVHD
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continues to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx yesterday
   - minimal sedation to avoid hypotension
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   - CVVHD has been intermittent [**3-11**] line issues, yesterday pulled LIJ and
   placed femoral, now running well. Goal i/o -2L
   - 5of peep, will get RSBI 87 this am, doing well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt
   extubation later today. However concerned given pt's high minute
   ventalation.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to maximize
   diuresis
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol prophylaxis held to increase BP while on CVVHD
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   -HRS meds stoped
   - Poor UO with lasix and diuril
   - on CVVHD diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -2L today
   -monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of fxn
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute lobar PNA, and R pleural effusion.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 83 bpm (normal)
* Blood pressure: 126/42 mmHg (normal)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (normal)
* SpO2: 99%
* Height: 66 inches (normal)
* CVP: 13 mmHg (normal)

The patient has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on 3L NC oxygen. She has a history of CHF, and her hypoxia remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistent with PE or other intraparenchymal lung shunting.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be underestimated
* Cirrhosis of the liver, stage IV disease
* ESLD
* ESRD
* Anemia, other
* Diabetes mellitus, type II
* Renal failure, acute (ARF)
* Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is less likely given the patient's active infectious process and UNa > 10
* Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis
* New cough since TIPS procedure
* RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing
* No abdominal ascites on previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam, therefore SBP unlikely

The patient has undergone a number of procedures, including:

* TIPS procedure, complicated by slight injury to L portal vein
* Thoracentesis, no tapable effusion noted on US
* CT torso, unchanged compared to prior
* Bronchoscopy, unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys
* Renal biopsy, showing ATN and CIN
* CVVHD, stopped yesterday after -1.5 L negative for day
* HD, planned for tomorrow and if tolerated, will transfer to floor
* Tunneling line, planned for Monday

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with various comorbidities, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Mitral Regurgitation, Cirrhosis of the Liver, Anemia, Diabetes Mellitus (Type II), and Acute Renal Failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 126/42 mmHg (64/58 mmHg) and 110/37 mmHg (58/76 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, and the patient is receiving fluids at a rate of 5,015 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a face tent, PSV/SBT mode, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG values are pH 7.38, pCO2 42 mmHg, and pO2 170 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 116 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 169 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include abnormal liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to respond to stimuli and lack of movement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and respiratory failure may lead to further decline in lung function, requiring increased respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and abnormal liver enzymes may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, requiring dialysis or further management.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's Mitral Regurgitation and Cirrhosis of the Liver may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's Cirrhosis of the Liver may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can affect the patient's mental status and cognitive function.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and impaired gut function may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can further compromise the patient's overall health."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - Vent settings on ARDSnet protocol, pt oxygenating well
   - titrating down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerating
   - increased P02 after increased hydral dosage, consistant with CHF
   contributing to hypoxia, titrated hdryal up to 15 q8h. However d/ced
   hydralazine while getting CVVHD since BP dropping.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc while on CVVHD
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continues to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx yesterday
   - minimal sedation to avoid hypotension
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   - CVVHD has been intermittent [**3-11**] line issues, yesterday pulled LIJ and
   placed femoral, now running well. Goal i/o -2L
   - 5of peep, will get RSBI 87 this am, doing well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt
   extubation later today. However concerned given pt's high minute
   ventalation.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to maximize
   diuresis
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol prophylaxis held to increase BP while on CVVHD
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.4, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG consistantly elevated
   -discontinue Glargine + HISS.
   -started insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   -HRS meds stoped
   - Poor UO with lasix and diuril
   - on CVVHD diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -2L today
   -monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of fxn
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro at new renal dosages
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso.  Will d/c
   abx, as may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), lobar PNA, and R pleural effusion on Chest CT.

The patient has a complex medical history, including cirrhosis of the liver, mitral regurgitation, and portal vein thrombosis. She has been on multiple medications, including diuretics, anticoagulants, and antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on ARDSnet protocol, with a SpO2 of 99%. She has been experiencing hypoxia, which is resistant to increasing O2, and is being treated with hydralazine and CVVHD.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated. She has been experiencing volume overload and hypoxia, which is likely contributing to her respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, and has been experiencing abdominal discomfort, likely related to pleural effusion irritation of the abdomen. She has also been experiencing diarrhea, which is likely related to her intubation.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely related to contrast dye exposure. She has been experiencing poor urine output, and is being treated with CVVHD.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is likely related to her underlying medical conditions.
* Endocrine: The patient has type II diabetes, which is being treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if she does not receive adequate treatment. She may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mitral regurgitation and volume overload may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as variceal bleeding or ascites.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances or uremia.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia may lead to further complications, such as fatigue or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Endocrine complications: The patient's type II diabetes may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -If tolerate HD tomorrow will transfer to floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute lobar pneumonia, and right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on oxygen therapy and has been extubated. She has a SpO2 of 99% and is on 3L NC.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated due to acoustic shadowing on the echocardiogram. She has also been experiencing hypertension and has been started on hydralazine.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, which is believed to be caused by contrast dye-related nephropathy. Her creatinine levels have worsened since the TIPS procedure, and she is currently anuric.
* Hepatic: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, stage IV disease by biopsy. She has also had a recent episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and banding of grade II varices.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is being monitored. She has also been transfused with PRBCs.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus, type II, which is being managed with insulin.
* Infectious: The patient has pneumonia and pleural effusion, which is being treated with antibiotics. She also has a history of Clostridioides difficile infection.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or pleural effusion
* Cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to mitral regurgitation
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to contrast dye-related nephropathy or sepsis
* Hepatic complications such as liver failure or portal hypertension due to cirrhosis
* Hematological complications such as bleeding or infection due to anemia or thrombocytopenia
* Endocrine complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes mellitus
* Infectious complications such as sepsis or pneumonia due to pneumonia or pleural effusion.

The patient's current plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support with oxygen therapy and possible intubation if necessary
* Cardiovascular support with hydralazine and possible diuretics
* Renal support with hemodialysis and possible peritoneal dialysis
* Hepatic support with lactulose and rifaximin
* Hematological support with transfusions and possible anticoagulation
* Endocrine support with insulin and possible glucagon
* Infectious support with antibiotics and possible antifungals.

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for further monitoring and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
2. Respiratory Failure
3. Mitral Regurgitation (Mitral Insufficiency)
4. Cirrhosis of the Liver
5. Anemia
6. Diabetes Mellitus (Type II)
7. Renal Failure

The patient's condition has been unstable, with a sequence of events including respiratory and renal failure after undergoing a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) level: 9.1 g/dL
* White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 17.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 116 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) level: 3.0 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level: 26.7 mg/dL
* Albumin level: 4.4 g/dL
* Lactic Acid level: 1.7 mmol/L
* Ca++ level: 9.5 mg/dL
* Mg++ level: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4 level: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Overweight/obese
* Respiratory system: Tachypnea, bilateral crackles
* Cardiovascular system: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, holosystolic murmur
* Abdominal system: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Neurologic system: Attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to person and place

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Invasive ventilation
* Hydralazine infusion
* Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration (CVVH)
* Insulin infusion for glycemic control
* Standing anxiolytic medication
* Intermittent hemodialysis (HD)
* Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory function
2. Progression of renal failure
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock
4. Hemorrhagic complications from hydralazine infusion
5. Electrolyte imbalances from insulin and diuretic therapy
6. Cardiovascular instability due to mitral regurgitation and cirrhosis
7. Infection or bleeding complications from invasive lines and catheters
8. Malnutrition and compromised immune function due to prolonged ICU stay

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the medical plan as necessary to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -If tolerate HD tomorrow will transfer to floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) and lobar pneumonia, and right pleural effusion. She has undergone a TIPS procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein. She has also developed a left portal vein thrombosis.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

* Respiratory failure, which is resistant to increasing oxygen therapy
* Hypoxia, which may be due to CHF, PE, or other intraparenchymal lung shunting
* Anemia, which has been treated with PRBC transfusions
* Diabetes mellitus, type II, which is currently well-controlled
* Renal failure, acute, which is thought to be due to contrast dye-related nephropathy
* Fever, which is likely related to PNA/pleural effusion or PE from portal vein thrombosis
* Abdominal discomfort, which may be related to pleural effusion irritation or L portal vein thrombosis
* Anxiety, which is being treated with Ativan

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to further hypoxia and potential cardiac arrest.
* Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to further respiratory failure and potential cardiac arrest.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to further fatigue and potential cardiovascular complications.
* Diabetes mellitus, type II: The patient's diabetes may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to further hyperglycemia and potential cardiovascular complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -If tolerate HD tomorrow will transfer to floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
   -started ativan 1mg q6h prn. Will be reluctant to increase dose much

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   over the last several days without clear explanation.  Although she has
   significant mitral regurgitation there has not been a dramatic change
   in her cardiac function to explain why she developed pulmonary edema.
   Temporally the connection to her TIPS raises the possibility that she
   had hemodynamic changes post procedure that may have contributed to
   cardiac decomp. Nevertheless, she is now breathing comfortably with
   clear chest and her R pleural effusion has even resolved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.

   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,

   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of

   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on

s assessment and plan as above.  She has improved dramatically
   over the last several days without clear explanation.  Although she has
   significant mitral regurgitation there has not been a dramatic change
   in her cardiac function to explain why she developed pulmonary edema.
   Temporally the connection to her TIPS raises the possibility that she
   had hemodynamic changes post procedure that may have contributed to
   cardiac decomp. Nevertheless, she is now breathing comfortably with
   clear chest and her R pleural effusion has even resolved.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) lobar PNA, and R pleural effusion. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure, fever, and abdominal discomfort. She has also been diagnosed with mitral regurgitation, anemia, type II diabetes, and acute renal failure.

Recent events:

* The patient's wrist pain has increased, and she was given prn oxycodone.
* She was extubated on 9/13, but temporarily desaturated to 85% after extubation.
* She has been experiencing fevers, which have been attributed to PNA/pleural effusion-related or PE from portal vein thrombosis.
* Her renal function has worsened, and she has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely related to contrast dye exposure.
* She has been started on hemodialysis and is currently anuric.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions, such as mitral regurgitation and chronic liver disease.
* Infection: The patient's fevers and pleural effusion may indicate an ongoing infection, which could spread to other parts of the body.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's worsening renal function may lead to acute kidney injury, which could require further interventions.
* Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver disease and renal failure may lead to hepatorenal syndrome, a life-threatening condition.
* Portal vein thrombosis: The patient's portal vein thrombosis may lead to further complications, such as liver failure or bowel ischemia.
* Mitral regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation may worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
* Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to further complications, such as ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, and nephropathy.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Investigate the source of the patient's fevers and treat accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Consider further interventions to prevent portal vein thrombosis, such as anticoagulation therapy.
* Consider further interventions to prevent mitral regurgitation, such as valve repair or replacement.
* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's diabetes and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Consider further interventions to prevent complications of liver disease, such as liver transplantation."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of

   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), lobar PNA, and right pleural effusion. She has a history of mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated due to acoustic shadowing. The patient was intubated on [**9-5**] and extubated on [**9-13**] with temporary desaturation to 85%. She is currently on 3L NC oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 17.7
* Platelet count: 116
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24.5 mg/dL
* Albumin: 4.4 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Ca++: 9.3 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4: 5.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* NASH cirrhosis, stage IV disease
* ESLD
* ESRD
* Mitral regurgitation
* L portal vein thrombosis
* Abdominal discomfort
* Anemia
* Type II diabetes mellitus
* Acute renal failure (ARF)

The patient's current medications include:

* Hydralazine 5mg q8h
* Allopurinol
* Rifaximin
* Ursodiol
* Lactulose 30mg q12h
* Glargine + HISS
* Ativan 1mg q6h prn

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue HD tomorrow and if tolerates, tunneling line on Monday
* Monitor for UO and renal function
* Repeat abdominal US on [**9-8**]
* Trend LFTs
* Serial abdominal exams
* Repeat hep panel and PPD for beginning of transplant workup

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of respiratory failure
* Development of sepsis or infection
* Progression of liver disease
* Further deterioration of renal function
* Hemorrhagic complications from portal vein thrombosis
* Development of electrolyte imbalances
* Worsening of anemia
* Uncontrolled blood sugar levels
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Potential for liver transplant candidacy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
   -started ativan 1mg q6h prn. Will be reluctant to increase dose much
   with abuse h/o

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She was admitted with respiratory failure, acute lobar PNA, and R pleural effusion. She was intubated and extubated, and currently on 3L NC oxygen. She has a history of mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated. She has also developed L portal vein thrombosis and is at risk for bleeding.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: SpO2 99%, on 3L NC oxygen, with a history of respiratory failure and PNA.
* Cardiovascular: HR 76 bpm, BP 109/33 mmHg, with a history of mitral regurgitation and possible PE or pulmonary infarct.
* Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD.
* Renal: Creatinine 3.1 mg/dL, with a history of acute renal failure and possible contrast dye-related injury.
* Hepatic: Hct 8.4 g/dL, with a history of cirrhosis and ESLD.
* Endocrine: Diabetes mellitus type II, with a history of insulin treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and she may require further respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's BP is labile, and she may be at risk for hypotension or hypertension.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may require further dialysis.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may be at risk for further liver damage.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct level is low, and she may require further transfusions.
* Infection: The patient has a history of PNA and pleural effusion, and may be at risk for further infection.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis and is at risk for bleeding.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires ongoing monitoring and management. The plan is to continue to provide respiratory support, monitor her cardiovascular status, and manage her renal and hepatic function. The patient will also require further transfusions and may require further dialysis. The patient's antibiotic regimen will be continued, and she will be monitored for signs of infection. The patient's pain will be managed with oxycodone, and she will be referred to occupational therapy for splint placement on her left wrist."
