Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Ischemic Heart Disease, and allergies to Lisinopril. They were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and have been receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 51 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has a central venous catheter in place. They have a pulmonary artery catheter, which is being used to monitor their hemodynamic status.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 14.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 181 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their unstable medical condition. They are unable to assess the patient's peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and Ischemic Heart Disease puts them at risk for further cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk for developing respiratory failure or pneumonia due to their prolonged ICU stay and the use of mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections, or sepsis, due to their indwelling lines and tubes.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's limited neurologic examination and history of CAD increase their risk for developing neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or cognitive impairment.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications, such as heparin, increases their risk for bleeding complications, such as hematomas or hematuria.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's limited oral intake and reliance on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) increases their risk for nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, or liver dysfunction.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of stress ulcer prophylaxis medications increases their risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3431**] is a 62 YOM with coronary artery disease status post bare
   metal stent to left circumflex who presented for elective
   catheterization secondary to exertional angina and positive stress
   Sestamibi, who was found to have significant left main disease and is
   status post balloon pump while awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Known coronary artery disease with previous bare metal
   stent.  Now found to have significant disease throughout the left main,
   LAD, and right coronary artery.  The patient is at significant risk for
   ischemia and would benefit from CABG.  Because of severity of coronary
   artery disease he had placement of balloon pump necessitating ICU
   monitoring.
   -- continue heparin gtt
   -- Continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] (will hold if HR < 55)
   -- Continue full dose asa and simvastatin
   -- CT surgery consulted for CABG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2386**] (consented)
   -- Pre-op UA, CXR, coags
   -- NPO at MN
   -- Will need PT consult after CABG
   -- On balloon pump for increased perfusion of coronary arteries not
   because of decreased EF, but because degree of stenosis and goal of
   increased coronary perfusing pressure
   .
   # PUMP:  Evidence of moderate RV dilation and hypokinesis and regional
   left ventricular systolic dyfunction but preserved EF.
   -- On balloon pump as above
   -- Will need to start [**Last Name (un) 284**] (allergy to ACEi)
   -- Continue metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is in NSR with rates in the low 60s, high 50s.  No
   evidence of AV delay or heart block
   -- continue to monitor on telemetry
   -- Replete lytes PRN
   -- Will give metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], but hold if HR < 55
   .
   #  HYPERTENSION: BP in the 140s.  Pt thinks he is supposed to take 100
   mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, this was recently changed to half this dose
   ([**2182-4-22**])
   -- as above continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- Continue simvastatin
   .
   #  GLUCOSE INTOLLERANCE:
   -- FS QID
   -- Insulin SS
   .
   #  DEPRESSION:
   -- Continue Lexapro
   -- SW consult for coping

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3431**] is a 62 YOM with coronary artery disease status post bare
   metal stent to left circumflex who presented for elective
   catheterization secondary to exertional angina and positive stress
   Sestamibi, who was found to have significant left main disease and is
   status post balloon pump while awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Known coronary artery disease with previous bare metal
   stent.  Now found to have significant disease throughout the left main,
   LAD, and right coronary artery.  The patient is at significant risk for
   ischemia and would benefit from CABG.  Because of severity of coronary
   artery disease he had placement of balloon pump necessitating ICU
   monitoring.
   -- continue heparin gtt
   -- Continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] (will hold if HR < 55)
   -- Continue full dose asa and simvastatin
   -- CT surgery consulted for CABG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2386**] (consented)
   -- Pre-op UA, CXR, coags
   -- NPO at MN
   -- Will need PT consult after CABG
   -- On balloon pump for increased perfusion of coronary arteries not
   because of decreased EF, but because degree of stenosis and goal of
   increased coronary perfusing pressure
   .
   # PUMP:  Evidence of moderate RV dilation and hypokinesis and regional
   left ventricular systolic dyfunction but preserved EF.
   -- On balloon pump as above
   -- Will need to start [**Last Name (un) 284**] (allergy to ACEi)
   -- Continue metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is in NSR with rates in the low 60s, high 50s.  No
   evidence of AV delay or heart block
   -- continue to monitor on telemetry
   -- Replete lytes PRN
   -- Will give metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], but hold if HR < 55
   .
   #  HYPERTENSION: BP in the 140s.  Pt thinks he is supposed to take 100
   mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, this was recently changed to half this dose
   ([**2182-4-22**])
   -- as above continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- Continue simvastatin
   .
   #  GLUCOSE INTOLLERANCE:
   -- FS QID
   -- Insulin SS
   .
   #  DEPRESSION:
   -- Continue Lexapro
   -- SW consult for coping
   .
   FEN:  Cardiac heart healthy diet, NPO for procedure at MN

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 62-year-old male, is a post-operative patient with coronary artery disease (CAD) status post bare metal stent to the left circumflex. He presented for elective catheterization due to exertional angina and positive stress Sestamibi, which revealed significant left main disease. He was placed on a balloon pump while awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 51 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/54 mmHg. He is receiving heparin infusion, metoprolol, aspirin, and simvastatin. His respiratory support is minimal, with an SpO2 of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 40.4%
* Platelet count: 181 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 14.8 g/dL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 26 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his condition, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Ischemia due to significant coronary artery disease
* Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Glucose intolerance
* Depression
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy
* Stress ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation

The patient is scheduled for CABG and is being monitored closely for any signs of complications."
