   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology recs regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen

   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1 on admission. Resolved to 11.2 this morning.
   Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from last hospitalization was
   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.
   From looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and
   was going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, who presented with weakness, left-sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria, which have since resolved. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate is 78 bpm, blood pressure is 200/73 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure is not assessed.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,000 mL of IV fluids, with a balance of 160 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 11.2 K/uL, Hct 33.7%, Plt 283 K/uL
	+ Blood chemistry: Cr 0.9 mg/dL, TropT 0.10 ng/mL, Glucose 100 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 12.1/26.8/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 88/7/0.08, Differential-Neuts 57.1%, Lymph 37.3%, Mono 3.7%, Eos 1.6%, Ca++ 8.7 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.0 mg/dL, PO4 4.3 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of multiple TIAs and is currently on Aggrenox, which may increase the risk of skin integrity issues.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may be a sign of infection, such as community-acquired pneumonia, or a chronic elevation.
3. Hypoxia: The patient had hypoxia in the emergency department, which has since resolved, but may be a sign of underlying respiratory or cardiac issues.
4. Gait disorder: The patient has a known pubic rami fracture and has recently slipped from her bed, which may indicate a gait disorder.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking mirtazapine per outpatient regimen.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Follow-up with neurology regarding recurring TIA while on Aggrenox
2. Consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG
3. Continue Aggrenox per outpatient regimen
4. Restart lisinopril 40mg po daily, per outpatient regimen
5. Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone until further neurology evaluation
6. Continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen
7. Follow-up TSH, Vit B12
8. Blood cultures
9. UA, urine culture

   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology recs regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox

   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness, dysarthria, and hypoxia. She has a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and is currently on aggrenox. The patient's symptoms have since resolved, but she remains at risk for recurrent TIAs. She also has leukocytosis, which may be related to community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis, or encephalitis. The patient has been treated for pneumonia and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent TIA: Given the patient's history of multiple TIAs and the presence of leukocytosis, there is a high risk of recurrent TIA. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of neurological symptoms, and further evaluation with MRI/MRA, Echo, and EEG may be necessary to rule out PFO.
2. Meningitis or Encephalitis: The patient's leukocytosis may be indicative of meningitis or encephalitis, which could lead to serious complications if left untreated. Further evaluation with blood cultures, urine culture, and hematologic workup may be necessary to rule out these conditions.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for community-acquired pneumonia, but there is a risk of complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and organ dysfunction if the infection is not adequately treated.
4. Gait Disorder: The patient's recent fall and pubic rami fracture may indicate a gait disorder, which could increase the risk of further falls and complications.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently being treated with mirtazapine. It is essential to monitor the patient's mental health and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, but it is essential to ensure that she is receiving adequate nutrition to prevent malnutrition and related complications.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her age, immobility, and medical conditions. Prophylaxis with heparin SQ and compression stockings may be necessary to prevent DVT.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and prompt treatment are essential to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness and dysarthria. The patient has undergone a series of medical interventions, including antibiotic infusions, fluid management, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 200/73 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula, and their respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute.

The patient's lab results show evidence of organ dysfunction, including a white blood cell count of 283 K/uL, a platelet count of 10.7 g/dL, and a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.10 ng/mL, indicating potential cardiac injury. The patient's glucose level is within normal limits at 100 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP), and has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity and CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction). The patient is at risk for developing medical complications, including:

1. Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and impaired skin integrity places them at risk for developing further infections.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin level and cardiac arrhythmia (SA) suggest potential cardiac injury, which may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula suggest potential respiratory failure, which may lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL suggests potential renal dysfunction, which may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and impaired skin integrity places them at risk for developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cerebral edema.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential for medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to ensure prompt recognition and management of any potential complications."

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of multiple TIAs on aggrenox presents from
   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology in AM regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA in AM
   -Patient has no Echo in our system. Consider Echo in the AM to rule out
   PFO.
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen
   -obtain fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C
   -allow autoregulation of BP with goal SBP < 185
   -labetalol PRN SBP>185
   -hold lisinopril. Consider restarting in the AM.
   -Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone tonight
   -consider EEG in AM
   -continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen
   -obtain TSH, Vit B12
   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1. Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from
   last hospitalization was 14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However
   given new hypoxia, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Patient
   reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is possible
   that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though clinically
   patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic elevation.
   Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative. From
   looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and was
   going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].
   -blood cultures
   -UA, urine culture
   -d/c foley catheter
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
   .
   3. Hypoxia: CTA negative for PE. CT chest does not show infiltrates,
   however given leukocytosis and hypoxia, would strongly consider
   community acquired pneumonia. Influenza swab performed in ED is
   negative. Lactate of 2.3 likely from increased work of breathing. EKG
   unchanged from baseline.
   -Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA pneumonia
   -supplemental oxygen as needed
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -repeat lactate in AM
   -rule out MI -1st set negative
   4. Gait disorder: Patient recently slipped from her bed at rehab.  She
   has a known pubic rami fracture, seen on CT today.  She has seen
   orthopedics as an outpatient.
   -weight bearing as tolerated.
   -fall precautions
   .
   # h/o Depression: continue mirtazapine per outpatient regimen
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO for now. Consider heart healthy
   diet in the AM if mental status improves.
   # PPX:  heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV x2
   # CODE: DNR/DNI  -confirmed with HCP

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of multiple TIAs on aggrenox presents from
   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology in AM regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA in AM
   -Patient has no Echo in our system. Consider Echo in the AM to rule out
   PFO.
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen
   -obtain fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C
   -allow autoregulation of BP with goal SBP < 185
   -labetalol PRN SBP>185
   -hold lisinopril. Consider restarting in the AM.
   -Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone tonight
   -consider EEG in AM
   -continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen
   -obtain TSH, Vit B12
   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1. Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from
   last hospitalization was 14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However
   given new hypoxia, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Patient
   reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is possible
   that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though clinically
   patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic elevation.
   Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative. From
   looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and was
   going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].
   -blood cultures
   -UA, urine culture
   -d/c foley catheter
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
   .
   3. Hypoxia: CTA negative for PE. CT chest does not show infiltrates,
   however given leukocytosis and hypoxia, would strongly consider
   community acquired pneumonia. Influenza swab performed in ED is
   negative. Lactate of 2.3 likely from increased work of breathing. EKG
   unchanged from baseline.
   -Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA pneumonia
   -supplemental oxygen as needed
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -repeat lactate in AM
   -rule out MI -1st set negative
   4. Gait disorder: Patient recently slipped from her bed at rehab.  She
   has a known pubic rami fracture, seen on CT today.  She has seen
   orthopedics as an outpatient.
   -weight bearing as tolerated.
   -fall precautions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old female admitted to the MICU with a history of multiple TIAs, who presented with transient hypoxemia and was triaged to the MICU overnight. The patient's symptoms have resolved, and she is currently stable.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 98.5°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, and blood pressure of 176/68 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, anxious, and with normal breath sounds. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal sinus rhythm. Her abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Her neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive, responding to verbal stimuli, and alert but oriented.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 283 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.08 ng/mL. Her imaging studies, including a CT torso and head, are normal, with no acute intracranial abnormality.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Recurrent TIAs: The patient has a history of multiple TIAs, and it is possible that she may experience another episode while in the hospital.
2. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics, and it is possible that she may develop an infection, particularly given her history of multiple TIAs.
3. Seizure: The patient has had a seizure in the past, and it is possible that she may experience another seizure while in the hospital.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary nodules, and it is possible that she may develop a pulmonary embolism while in the hospital.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and it is possible that her blood pressure may become uncontrolled while in the hospital.
6. Fall risk: The patient has a history of falls, and it is possible that she may fall while in the hospital.
7. Nutritional compromise: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to her age and medical history, and it is possible that she may develop malnutrition while in the hospital.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuation of Aggrenox and statin therapy.
2. Continuation of vancomycin and ceftriaxone therapy until further discussion with the neurologist.
3. Cautious control of blood pressure to prevent further TIAs.
4. Orthopedic evaluation for the patient's pubic ramus fracture.
5. Fall precautions to prevent further falls.
6. Monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and glycemic control.
7. Continuation of prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with a likely recurrent transient ischemic attack (TIA) and transient hypoxemia, which has resolved since admission. She has a history of multiple TIAs and is on Aggrenox. She is currently stable on room air, with no recurrent hypoxemia noted. Her physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, anxious, and well-nourished. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin-T and creatinine levels. Imaging studies, including CT head and torso, show no acute intracranial abnormality and chronic lung scar versus infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent TIA: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and the current likely recurrent TIA make it a high-risk condition for further neurological deficits or stroke.
2. Hypoxemia: Although the patient's hypoxemia has resolved since admission, there is a risk of recurrent hypoxemia, especially if there are any underlying respiratory or cardiac conditions.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated troponin-T and creatinine levels may indicate underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and managed.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure, which needs to be further evaluated and managed.
5. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's chronic lung scar versus infiltrate may increase the risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and the current likely recurrent TIA make it a high-risk condition for further neurological deficits or stroke.
7. Falls: The patient's history of falls and the current presence of a pubic ramus fracture increase the risk of further falls and injuries.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential medical complications."

   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, presenting with weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria, which have since resolved. She has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient has leukocytosis, which has resolved, and has been afebrile. She has also been experiencing hypoxia, which has resolved, and has been treated for possible pneumonia. The patient has a pubic rami fracture and has been advised to follow up with orthopedics regarding weight-bearing and fall precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurring TIA: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and the recent episode of weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria make it likely that she will experience further TIAs. Monitoring of her neurologic status and follow-up with neurology are essential.
2. Meningitis or Encephalitis: The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status make it possible that she has meningitis or encephalitis. Further evaluation, including blood cultures, urine analysis, and imaging studies, is necessary to rule out these conditions.
3. Community-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient's diagnosis of CAP and treatment with antibiotics are necessary to prevent complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and mortality.
4. Pubic Rami Fracture: The patient's fracture requires careful management to prevent further complications, such as delayed healing, infection, or nonunion.
5. Gait Disorder: The patient's gait disorder, likely caused by her fracture, increases her risk of falls and further injury. A physical therapy consult and fall precautions are necessary to prevent these complications.
6. Depression: The patient's history of depression requires continued treatment with mirtazapine to prevent worsening of her condition.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status requires careful monitoring to prevent malnutrition, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glycemic control requires careful monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening.
9. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's central venous catheter increases her risk of bloodstream infection. Prophylactic antibiotics and careful catheter care are necessary to prevent this complication.
10. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's hypoxia and DVT prophylaxis make it possible that she has a pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation, including imaging studies, is necessary to rule out this condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, who presented with weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria that has since resolved. She was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. The patient has been experiencing elevated blood pressures, which were controlled with Hydralazine. She also has a known pubic rami fracture and is weight-bearing as tolerated. The patient has been experiencing delirium, which is likely due to her TIA, and has been started on Amlodipine for hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressures have been elevated, which could lead to a hypertensive crisis if not controlled.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of CAP, which could lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Stroke: The patient has a history of TIAs, which could increase her risk of having a stroke if not managed properly.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium could worsen if not managed with proper sedation and pain control.
5. Wound complications: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could lead to wound complications such as infection or delayed healing.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation, which could lead to complications if not treated promptly.
7. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia could lead to respiratory failure or other complications if not treated promptly.
8. Fracture complications: The patient's pubic rami fracture could lead to complications such as infection, delayed healing, or long-term disability if not managed properly.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and history of TIAs could increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 103**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 104**], MD
   on:[**2160-10-12**] 15:27 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, admitted with likely recurrent TIA, and triaged to the MICU overnight for transient hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure ranging from 126/50 mmHg to 207/95 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, but no signs of infection, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal heart sounds, clear lung fields, and soft, non-tender abdomen. However, she has trace edema in both lower extremities. Her neurologic examination is abnormal, with the patient not following simple commands, not assessed for movement, tone, or reflexes.

The patient's medical conditions include hypertension, which is being managed with lisinopril and amlodipine, and a possible TIA, for which she is continuing Aggrenox and statin therapy. She also has a public ramus fracture, for which she is receiving physical therapy and occupational therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Recurrent TIAs or stroke: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and current symptoms suggest a high risk of recurrent TIAs or stroke.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a concern, especially given her age and the presence of chronic leukocytosis.
3. Infection: Although the patient's laboratory results do not suggest infection, her chronic leukocytosis and presence of a foreign body (central line) increase her risk of infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, especially given her history of TIAs and the risk of hypertensive crisis.
5. Fracture complications: The patient's public ramus fracture increases her risk of complications such as infection, nonunion, or malunion.
6. Neurological deficits: The patient's abnormal neurologic examination results suggest the possibility of permanent neurological deficits, especially if she has a recurrent TIA or stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and chronic leukocytosis increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, admitted with likely recurrent TIA and transient hypoxemia. The patient has had an unremarkable evaluation so far, but has developed labile blood pressure and increased delirium overnight, which has been managed with Haldol prn.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.2°C, Tcurrent 36°C, HR 68 bpm, BP 179/54 mmHg, RR 19 inspirations per minute, SpO2 99%.
* Respiratory support: No oxygen therapy required.
* Cardiovascular: Sinus rhythm, normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses.
* Neurologic: The patient is not following simple commands, responds to verbal commands, and has no movement or tone.
* Laboratory results: WBC 11.2 K/uL, Hct 33.6%, Plt 283 K/uL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, TropT 0.10 ng/mL, Glucose 100 mg/dL.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent TIAs: The patient has a history of TIAs, and the current symptoms may indicate a recurrent event. Monitoring the patient's neurological status and considering further imaging studies may be necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be a sign of an underlying infection, medication side effect, or other medical condition. Monitoring the patient's mental status and considering further evaluation may be necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and may require further management to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of TIAs and is at risk for pulmonary embolism. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and considering further imaging studies may be necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which may require further evaluation and management.

The plan of care includes:

1. Continued monitoring of the patient's neurological status and vital signs.
2. Management of the patient's delirium with Haldol prn and frequent re-orientation.
3. Monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and considering further management as necessary.
4. Continued prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention.
5. Transfer to the floor once the patient is stable and able to tolerate oral medications."
