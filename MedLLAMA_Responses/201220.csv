 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   55 yo man with large intracranial hemmorhage - R thalamic,
   intraventricular bleed with midline shift.  It appears that he was down
   at home for some time given the pressure ulcers on his L side.  His
   prognosis is very poor in light of timecourse, severity of bleed, and
   poor neuro exam.  Appreciate neurosurgical and neurology input - agree
   that any neurological intervention at this time would not change the
   outcome for this unfortunate gentleman.
   1. ICH: Cont to monitor BP to keep MAP < 110.  Do not overcorrect
   sodium to quickly.  Keep pCO2 in low 30s if possible
   2. Hypernatremia: Check frequently, correct only slowly.
   3. Acute Renal Failure: Cont to montior
   4. Respiratory Failure: Cont current vent settings
   5. GI Bleed: Trend Hcts

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a large intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the right thalamic region, with intraventricular bleeding and midline shift. The patient's prognosis is very poor due to the severity of the bleed, poor neuro exam, and prolonged time course.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 109 bpm (78-109)
* Blood pressure: 106/79 mmHg (88-119/82-94)
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute (18-34)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, and is being managed with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and PIP of 17 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 13.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 313 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.7 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 367 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 3.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.3 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
* Hyperglycemia
* Impaired skin integrity

The plan includes monitoring the patient's blood pressure to keep the mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 110, slowly correcting hypernatremia, and monitoring for acute renal failure and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the large ICH
* Seizures or status epilepticus
* Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Acute kidney injury or renal failure
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers
* Infection or sepsis
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock

Given the patient's poor prognosis, any neurological intervention at this time would not be expected to change the outcome. The patient's identity needs to be confirmed definitively, and social work needs to be consulted to address goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present, and now with
   maroon stool overnight. BUN elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated
   secondary to dehydration. Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown
   past medical history is broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**]
   tear, lower GI bleed, diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's (q6 hr)
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - replace free water (D5 at 200cc/h) as well as through TF flushes
   - q6h lytes
   - recheck urine lytes, ? evolving additional DI etiology
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Consider surgery c/s for debridement pending family discussion
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift. Concerns in the
   setting of IPH include herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
   Neurology and neurosurgery saw the patient in the emergency room and
   did not recommend interventions. Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is
   difficult to interpret.  He had some response to pain yesterday,
   although this morning, off propofol he is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (D5NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Consider surgery c/s for debridement
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was found unresponsive and has been admitted to the ICU. He has a history of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm
* Blood pressure: 142/82 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 35 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving insulin, propofol, and pantoprazole infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.6-18.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.0-41.7%
* Platelet count: 94 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.7-4.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 135-165 mg/dL
* Glucose: 96-367 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03-0.04 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 334 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 3.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage
* Rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure
* Hypernatremia and hypovolemic hypernatremia
* GI bleeding and potential underlying conditions such as gastritis, PUD, or diverticulosis
* Anion-gap acidosis and potential underlying conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis
* Sacral ulcers and potential underlying conditions such as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing to monitor his vital signs and laboratory results
* Weaning him off propofol and adjusting his insulin infusion
* Treating his respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and adjusting his FiO2 and PEEP as needed
* Managing his GI bleeding with active T+S, PPI, and serial hct's
* Replacing free water to correct his hypernatremia
* Treating his acute renal failure with IVF and trend CK
* Trending his CE and serial EKG's to monitor for NSTEMI/Troponin leak
* Following wound care recommendations for his sacral ulcers and considering surgery for debridement
* Continuing to monitor his neurologic status and considering neurology recommendations."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

They have a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 518, indicating adequate oxygenation. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 31 mmHg, and base excess of -21 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.3 K/uL, platelet count of 94 K/uL, and a creatinine level of 4.3 mg/dL. Their liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 63 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase level of 70 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure diagnosis and the need for mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which can lead to dehydration, seizures, and brain damage if left untreated.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) level suggests muscle damage, which can lead to muscle weakness, cramping, and kidney damage.
4. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): The patient's history of traumatic brain injury and the need for anticoagulation therapy increase their risk of developing ICH.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose level can lead to dehydration, ketoacidosis, and increased risk of infections.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's history of skin lesions and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
7. Ineffective coping: The patient's history of traumatic brain injury and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation may indicate a high risk of developing delirium and other psychological complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status. The patient's hypernatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperglycemia require immediate attention and treatment. The patient's risk of developing respiratory complications, such as VAP and respiratory distress syndrome, must be mitigated by maintaining proper ventilation settings and infection control measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   .
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Preliminary read of CTA of head
   indicated right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline
   shift. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to sedation from propofol
   and paralysis with vecuronium.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - Stop propofol to assess neuro status
   - will not continue the dilantin, as dilantin can interfere with
   platelet function
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Frequent ABG's
   - Place a-line
   .
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR huggers
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   .
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (1/2NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Wound care c/s
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to sedation from propofol
   and paralysis with vecuronium.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - Stop propofol to assess neuro status
   - will not continue the dilantin, as dilantin can interfere with
   platelet function
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am

   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Frequent ABG's
   - Place a-line

   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR huggers
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures

   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (1/2NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Wound care c/s

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who was found unresponsive and was intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure. He has multiple comorbidities, including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He is currently receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, insulin, and propofol, and is being monitored closely for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, herniation, and vasospasm, which can lead to neurological deficits or death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he may require dialysis to manage his electrolyte imbalances and fluid status.
4. GI bleeding: The patient is at risk for continued bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he may require slow replacement of free water to prevent further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated, indicating muscle damage, which can lead to further kidney damage and muscle weakness.
7. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Sacral ulcers: The patient's wounds are at risk for further infection and tissue damage, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
9. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is low, and he may require further warming to prevent hypothermia-induced organ damage.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and optimize his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who is critically ill with a large intracranial hemorrhage, including a thalamic bleed with midline shift. The patient is unable to provide a history due to being unresponsive. The patient's condition is stable, but his neuro exam remains poor, and his ability to assess his level of consciousness is clouded by metabolic derangements.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's intracranial hemorrhage and midline shift increase the risk of increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to further brain damage or even death.
2. Seizures: The patient's poor neuro exam and metabolic derangements increase the risk of seizures, which can be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory acidosis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and need for dialysis increase the risk of chronic kidney disease and potential need for long-term dialysis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood transfusions increase the risk of further bleeding and potential need for surgical intervention.
7. Decubitus ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers increase the risk of decubitus ulcers, which can lead to infection and potential need for surgical intervention.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and potential need for insulin therapy.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension increases the risk of organ failure and potential need for vasopressors.
10. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immobility increase the risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition, including:

1. Continuous monitoring of his intracranial pressure and neuro status.
2. Management of his respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and sedation.
3. Management of his hyperglycemia with insulin therapy and close monitoring of his blood glucose levels.
4. Management of his acute renal failure with dialysis and close monitoring of his renal function.
5. Management of his gastrointestinal bleeding with blood transfusions and close monitoring of his bleeding.
6. Management of his decubitus ulcers with wound care and close monitoring of his skin integrity.
7. Management of his hypotension with vasopressors and close monitoring of his blood pressure.
8. Management of his infection with antibiotics and close monitoring of his vital signs.

The patient's care requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving intensivists, neurologists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, and other specialists to manage his complex medical condition and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - proctoscopy to evaluate possibility of distal lesion (sugery vs
   proctoscopy)
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   - DDVAP for uremic platelets in setting of bleed and possible procedure
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today.
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 on admission likely due to hypovolemic
   hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167.
   Free water deficit is approximately 7.2L.  Na to 150 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely that
   rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - proctoscopy to evaluate possibility of distal lesion (sugery vs
   proctoscopy)
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   - DDVAP for uremic platelets in setting of bleed and possible procedure
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today.
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 on admission likely due to hypovolemic
   hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167.
   Free water deficit is approximately 7.2L.  Na to 150 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely that
   rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history who presents after being found down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including debridement of sacral ulcers, transfusion of blood products, and adjustment of sodium levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Herniation and hydrocephalus due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which requires close monitoring and possible interventions.
2. Vasospasm, which can lead to further neurological deficits and potential stroke.
3. GI bleeding, which can worsen the patient's anemia and increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly.
5. Hypernatremia, which can lead to central pontine myelinolysis and other complications if not corrected slowly and carefully.
6. Rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to acute kidney injury and other complications if not managed promptly.
7. Infection, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of sepsis and organ failure.
8. Hypothermia, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure.
9. NSTEMI/Troponin leak, which can worsen the patient's cardiac condition and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
10. Sacral ulcers, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of infection and sepsis.

The patient's family is still deciding about goals of care, and the patient's brother wants to make decisions, but the father is unsure. The patient's identification information is incomplete, and the father is unable to locate the patient's brother's phone number.

The patient's current medications include insulin, pantoprazole, propofol, and fentanyl. The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values for sodium, potassium, creatinine, and troponin. The patient's imaging studies show evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and possible cerebellar lesion.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of his neurological status, adjustment of his sodium levels, transfusion of blood products, and management of his GI bleeding. The patient's family will be counseled on the patient's condition and treatment options, and the patient's goals of care will be discussed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - Repeat CT head per [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - Transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s
   - GI consult
   - Continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   .
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.   Na to 150 this AM
   - replace free water (D5 at 200cc/h) as well as through TF flushes
   - q6h lytes
   - recheck urine lytes, ? evolving additional DI etiology
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history who presented after being found down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, which increases the risk of herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. The patient's neurologic exam is difficult to interpret, and he is not responding to pain, which may indicate a worsening of his condition.
2. GI bleed: The patient has a large amount of melena/brb output per flexiseal, which requires transfusion of 2 units of Hct, active T&S, and GI consult. The patient's sodium level is 162, which may indicate hypovolemic hypernatremia, and he needs to be rehydrated with free water.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection/respiratory failure, and his ABG showed 7.31/49/510. He needs to be weaned off the vent as tolerated and have his FiO2 decreased.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is 37.1°C, which may indicate central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency. He needs to be rewarmed with a Bair hugger and have his TSH, blood, and urine cultures checked.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 162, which is likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia. He needs to be rehydrated with free water and have his urine lytes rechecked.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is unknown, but he has a rising CK level, which suggests rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure. He needs to be rehydrated and have his urine lytes rechecked.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level is rising, which indicates rhabdomyolysis after being down for an unknown period. He needs to be continued on IVF and have his CK trended.
8. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient had a Trop I of 0.06 at OSH, which indicates a troponin leak. He needs to have his CE trended and serial EKGs performed.
9. Sacral ulcers: The patient has large eschars on his L back and coccyx and heel, which suggest he was down for several days. He needs to have his wound care followed and debrided by surgery.

The patient's family is still deciding about his goals of care, and he needs to have his ICU consent obtained. The patient's brother is unsure about his goals of care, and the family needs to be educated about his condition and treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a neuro-stroke patient in the MICU with ongoing family discussions regarding goals of care. The patient has been experiencing bright red blood from the flexiseal, and stat Hct was sent with a result of 232 K/uL. The patient has been receiving various medications, including insulin, pantoprazole, propofol, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.9°C, Tcurrent of 37.1°C, HR of 101 bpm, BP of 124/67 mmHg, and SpO2 of 99%. The patient is intubated and does not follow commands or respond to name.

The patient has a wound that was debrided, and 5 silk sutures were placed to stop bleeding, which will be removed on [**5-2**]. The patient has also had a family meeting, and the family is still deciding on the patient's goals of care.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's wound is still bleeding, and the sutures will need to be removed soon. There is a risk of further bleeding or infection.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator, which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, and respiratory failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has a neuro-stroke and is at risk for further neurological decline or worsening of their condition.
4. Infection: The patient has a wound that is at risk for infection, and the family meeting suggests that the family is still deciding on the patient's goals of care, which may delay or compromise the patient's treatment.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a fluid balance of 7,075 mL, which is above the normal range. This may indicate fluid overload or sepsis.
6. Blood product transfusion: The patient received 2 units of blood transfusion, which may increase the risk of blood-borne infections or transfusion reactions.
7. GNR in blood culture: The patient has GNR (gram-negative rod) in their blood culture, which may indicate sepsis or infection.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with a large intracranial hemorrhage, intraventricular bleed, and midline shift. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including hypernatremia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis. He is also experiencing respiratory failure and has a risk of aspiration due to his inability to protect his airway.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated sodium levels, with a current reading of 162 mg/dL. His creatinine levels are also elevated, indicating acute renal failure. His blood cultures have grown GNRs, and he is being treated empirically with Zosyn and vancomycin.

The patient's physical examination reveals a number of abnormalities, including a non-reactive right pupil, a left cataract, and bilateral lower extremity edema. His neurologic examination is limited due to his altered mental status and lack of responsiveness.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and hypernatremia put him at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if left untreated.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his ventilation settings are not adjusted properly, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to hemorrhagic shock and death if not treated promptly.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis may worsen if he is not treated with proper fluid management and electrolyte replacement, leading to kidney damage and failure.
6. Intracranial hypertension: The patient's intracranial hemorrhage may lead to increased intracranial pressure, which can cause brain herniation and death if not treated promptly.
7. Decubitus ulcers: The patient's prolonged bed rest may lead to the development of decubitus ulcers, which can become infected and lead to sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. He requires aggressive treatment for his hypernatremia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis, as well as close monitoring of his respiratory and neurologic status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

* The patient is a 55-year-old male with a large intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the right thalamic region, intraventricular bleed, and midline shift.
* The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving, but the rate of free water repletion is being slowed.
* The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being managed with blood transfusions and close monitoring.
* The patient has acute renal failure, which is being managed with ongoing hemodialysis.
* The patient has respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation.
* The patient has impaired skin integrity, which is being managed with wound care and debridement.
* The patient has a new lesion in the left cerebellum, which is being monitored by the neurology team.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's ICH and gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Potential for worsening renal failure and electrolyte imbalance due to the patient's acute kidney injury.
3. Risk of respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure due to the patient's bacteremia and acute kidney injury.
5. Risk of decubitus ulcers and skin breakdown due to the patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility.
6. Risk of electrolyte imbalance and hyperglycemia due to the patient's hypernatremia and ongoing glucose management.
7. Risk of poor wound healing and infection due to the patient's impaired skin integrity and ongoing wound care.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage potential complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a large amount of bright and dark rectal bleeding, which is ongoing. The patient has undergone a tagged RBC scan, which revealed active bleeding in the sigmoid colon. Despite being actively bleeding, the patient was not intervened upon by the IR angio team.

The patient has received 4 units of blood transfusions, with a stable hematocrit (Hct) of 28-30%. The patient was started on Levophed for hypotension and tachycardia, and later passed a large clot per rectum with ongoing bleeding. The patient's pressures have improved, and they are now off pressures.

The patient has a DNR status and has a brother who is advocating for CMO, while the father is more reluctant but may consider it in the morning.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 103 bpm (91-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 140/83 mmHg (66-157/91 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (18-32 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 134 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 20.3
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 193 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to hypovolemic shock, bleeding complications, and potential sepsis.
* Respiratory failure, which may worsen due to the patient's ongoing bleeding and potential aspiration risk.
* Hypernatremia, which may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential neurological complications.
* Rhabdomyolysis, which may lead to muscle damage, electrolyte imbalances, and potential kidney injury.
* Ineffective coping, which may lead to increased stress and anxiety, and potential complications such as ICU psychosis.
* Intracerebral hemorrhage, which may lead to neurological deficits, seizures, and potential death.
* Hyperglycemia, which may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
* Impaired skin integrity, which may lead to skin breakdown, infection, and potential sepsis.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their bleeding, respiratory status, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday, IR
   felt unable to intervene on clot
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with an unknown past medical history and was found down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including transfusions, medication adjustments, and surgical procedures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a systolic blood pressure between 120-160 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* GI bleed: The patient has had a large amount of melena/brb output and has passed a large clot, and is receiving protonix and transfusions.
* Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic exam is difficult to interpret, and he is not responding to pain.
* Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure, but it is resolving.
* Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rising CK levels, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis after being down for an unknown period of time.
* Sacral ulcers: The patient has large eschars on his back and coccyx, suggesting that he was down for several days.
* NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient had a troponin leak at the outside hospital, but it is no longer an active issue.
* Hypothermia: The patient has possible hypothermia, and his temperature is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Herniation: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, which can lead to herniation.
* Vasospasm: The patient has a right thalamic bleed, which can cause vasospasm.
* GI bleeding: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, which can lead to further hemorrhage.
* Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rising CK levels, which can lead to further muscle damage.
* Sacral ulcers: The patient has large eschars on his back and coccyx, which can lead to further infection and complications.
* Hypothermia: The patient has possible hypothermia, which can lead to further complications.

The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and a DNR order has been placed. The patient's brother is considering moving him to a comfort care model, and the family is awaiting further discussion."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man with a large intracranial hemorrhage, intraventricular bleed with midline shift, and bacteremia. The patient's neurological exam continues to be poor, and his previous goals of care suggest that aggressive care may not be in line with his wishes.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium level is 147 mmol/L, which is above the normal range. The plan is to discontinue fluid administration to correct this.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient has had a large softball-sized clot passed from his rectum and has received 6 units of packed red blood cells. The bleeding appears to have slowed, but the patient is at risk for further bleeding.
3. Bacteremia (GNR): The patient has a bacteremia, and empiric antibiotics (Zosyn and vancomycin) have been started.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slowly trending down, indicating possible improvement in renal function.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and the plan is to continue current vent settings.
6. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has pressure ulcers, and wound care is being continued. Surgery may be necessary to manage these ulcers.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated creatine kinase levels, indicating possible muscle damage.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, and glycemic control measures are being implemented.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers and may be at risk for further skin breakdown.
10. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has a large intracranial hemorrhage, which is a life-threatening condition.

The patient's family has been informed of his poor neurological status and has requested a visit by a Catholic priest prior to extubation. The patient's care is being transitioned to comfort measures only (CMO) due to his lack of neurological improvement and previously stated wishes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a large intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and bacteremia. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, insulin infusion, and antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 145/77 mmHg. He is receiving fluids and blood products, and his urine output is 2,500 mL.

The patient's neurological examination is poor, with no response to pain or commands. He has a midline shift and intraventricular bleed. The patient's family has been informed of his poor prognosis, and discussions are ongoing about transitioning to comfort measures only (CMO) care.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. ICH: The patient's ICH is not improving, and his neurological status remains poor.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and fluid restriction is necessary.
3. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has had a significant bleed, and he is receiving blood transfusions.
4. GNR bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, and empiric antibiotics are being administered.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and his renal function is deteriorating.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and his respiratory status is stable.
7. Decubitus ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers, and wound care is necessary.
8. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated creatine kinase levels, indicating muscle damage.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, and insulin infusion is necessary.
10. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is at risk for skin breakdown due to his critical illness.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure and worsening ICH
2. Respiratory failure and aspiration
3. Sepsis and multi-organ failure
4. Renal failure and need for dialysis
5. Cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias
6. Increased risk of nosocomial infections
7. Worsening of decubitus ulcers and skin breakdown
8. Increased risk of rhabdomyolysis and muscle damage
9. Hyperglycemic emergencies
10. Impaired wound healing and increased risk of sepsis.

Given the patient's critical illness and poor prognosis, it is essential to focus on providing comfort measures, managing his medical complications, and addressing any potential medical complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations and neurosurgery recs
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification:
   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 14108**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history, admitted to the ICU with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including:
	+ Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) with IVH and hydrocephalus
	+ Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
	+ Acute renal failure
	+ Hypernatremia
	+ GI bleeding
	+ Hypothermia
	+ Rhabdomyolysis
* The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of unknown.

**Potential Complications:**

* Herniation and hydrocephalus due to IPH
* Vasospasm and stroke due to IPH
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease due to acute renal failure
* Hypernatremia and dehydration due to hypovolemic hypernatremia
* GI bleeding and perforation due to sigmoid bleeding
* Rhabdomyolysis and muscle weakness due to prolonged immobilization
* Sacral ulcers and wound infection due to prolonged bedrest
* NSTEMI and cardiac arrhythmias due to Troponin leak
* Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency due to potential underlying conditions

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's condition is critical, and his code status is DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) but intubated.
* The patient requires close monitoring of his vital signs, respiratory function, and fluid balance.
* He requires ongoing management of his hypernatremia, acute renal failure, GI bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis.
* He requires ongoing monitoring of his cardiac function and potential for cardiac arrhythmias.
* He requires wound care and management of his sacral ulcers.
* The patient's family should be consulted regarding his code status and potential for hospice care.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory function, and fluid balance.
* Adjust his medications and dosages as necessary to manage his hypernatremia, acute renal failure, GI bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis.
* Continue to monitor his cardiac function and potential for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Provide ongoing wound care and management of his sacral ulcers.
* Consult with the patient's family regarding his code status and potential for hospice care."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations and neurosurgery recs
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification:
   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 14108**]

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history, was admitted to the ICU after being found down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He underwent a tagged RBC scan, which showed active sigmoid bleeding, and was transfused with 4 units of blood. He was also started on Levophed for hypotension and tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs were as follows: Tmax 37.8°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 102 bpm, BP 145/77 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 99%. His lab results showed WBC 20.3, Hct 28.3, and Plt 223.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient had a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, and concerns include herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
2. GI bleed: The patient had a large amount of melena/brb output and passed a large clot, and was transfused with 4 units of blood.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure, and his ABG showed 7.31/49/510.
4. Bacteremia: The patient had a GNR on outside hospital labs, and cultures are pending.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had a sodium level of 147, likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia, and was repleted with half-normal saline-free water.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient had resolving acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal etiology.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient had rising CK levels, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
8. Sacral ulcers: The patient had large eschars on his L back and coccyx and heel, suggesting he was down for several days.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Neurologic exam: The patient's neurologic exam is difficult to interpret, and he is not responding to pain.
2. GI bleed: The patient will be transfused with blood and continued on protonix.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient will continue on the ventilator for airway protection.
4. Bacteremia: The patient will continue on vanc and zosyn, and cultures will be followed.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient will be repleted with half-normal saline-free water.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient will be followed for u/o.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient will continue IVF and trend CK levels.
8. Sacral ulcers: The patient will follow wound care recommendations.

The patient's code status is DNR, and he is intubated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He has been intubated and received antibiotics, but due to his condition, comfort measures only have been initiated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg. His respiratory support includes oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for sepsis, particularly given his compromised immune system.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has a large skin ulcer and may be at risk for further GI bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may increase his risk for infection, particularly in the skin and soft tissues.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and troponin leak may increase his risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothermia may be related to hypothyroidism, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypothermia may also be related to adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent further sepsis.
3. Continue to manage the patient's GI bleeding with transfusions and wound care.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Manage the patient's cardiovascular status with medications and consider further testing to rule out cardiovascular complications.
6. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.
7. Continue to provide supportive care, including pain management and wound care, to ensure the patient's comfort and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was found down with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He was intubated at the outside hospital for airway protection and respiratory failure. The patient has been made comfort measures only and is currently on a morphine drip. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a GNR bacteremia and has had a large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and passed a large clot, which may indicate a GI bleed. He also has sacral ulcers and has been debrided by surgery.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a CXR that remains clear. However, his FiO2 is still 40%, and his PEEP is 5 cmH2O.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a rising creatinine level, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level is rising, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which may indicate hypovolemic hypernatremia.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothermia may be due to central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency.
7. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may indicate a NSTEMI or troponin leak.

Assessment and plan:

The patient is currently on comfort measures only and is receiving morphine, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. His vital signs are stable, and he is being monitored for signs of infection, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The patient's family is being consulted regarding his care, and he is being considered for hospice care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate is 84 beats per minute, blood pressure is 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving a morphine drip and has a central venous catheter in place.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 3,081 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 2,035 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 24.5 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count is 194 K/uL. Other laboratory results include elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and troponin-T, indicating possible cardiac damage.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's current status include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. This may indicate a risk of respiratory failure or worsening respiratory status.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate an underlying septic process.
* Cardiac damage: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and decreased ejection fraction may indicate cardiac damage or injury.
* Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids over the past 24 hours, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications.
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which may increase the risk of VAP.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   Per discussion with family made comfort measures only on Friday [**4-30**].
   # Comfort: patient appears comfortable, was started on morphine
    - continue morphine drip
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  Stable according to last CT scan.
   Extubated yesterday
   - continue to monitor and keep comfortable
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot [**4-29**], transfused total of 4 units, tagged RBC scan
   showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on clot.
   Hemodynamically stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   Per discussion with family made comfort measures only on Friday [**4-30**].
   # Comfort: patient appears comfortable, was started on morphine
    - continue morphine drip
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  Stable according to last CT scan.
   Extubated yesterday
   - continue to monitor and keep comfortable
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot [**4-29**], transfused total of 4 units, tagged RBC scan
   showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on clot.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue to keep comfortable
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - now extubated, continue to support
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 due to an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He was intubated and received antibiotics, but was later extubated and placed on comfort measures only (CMO) after discussion with his family. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg. He is receiving morphine for pain management and is being supported with oxygen therapy. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has a large eschar on his left back and coccyx, suggesting that he was down for several days prior to admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia may be a sign of underlying conditions such as central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency.
5. GI bleeding: The patient has a large eschar on his left back and coccyx, suggesting that he was down for several days prior to admission, which may have led to GI bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for further infections.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, brain edema, or hydrocephalus.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI/Troponin leak may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
9. Wound complications: The patient's large eschar on his left back and coccyx may lead to wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing."
