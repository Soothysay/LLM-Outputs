You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old post-transplantation patient with a history of acute leukemia, neutropenia, and coagulopathy. Overnight, the patient developed a fever of 105.5°F, which improved with the administration of Tylenol and cool sponges. The patient also passed melanotic stools, but no more hematemesis. The patient's white blood cell count is expected to recover within the week, as per the bone marrow transplant (BMT) team.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management medications. The patient is also receiving fluid and electrolyte management, as well as respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to the patient's uncooperative behavior. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 28,000/μL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 45,000/μL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hypocalcemia (calcium level of 7.4 mg/dL).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukopenia make them susceptible to sepsis.
2. Infections: The patient's neutropenia and coagulopathy increase their risk of developing infections, particularly with gram-positive cocci.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia increase their risk of bleeding.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may exacerbate muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen therapy may not be sufficient to manage their respiratory status.
6. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and coagulopathy increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be a sign of impending organ failure.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and prompt intervention to prevent and manage these complications, ensuring the patient receives optimal care in the ICU."

 RASH
 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile,
   and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute GI bleed.
   GI BLEED
   Acute bleed in the setting of neutropenia and leukopenia, as well as
   thrombocytopenia. This setting both increases bleeding risk from
   ordinary causes of GIB (e.g., PUD, AVM, etc); and also raises the
   question of infectious causes (e.g., HSV, CMV; or an erosive
   esophagitis). He is well covered for most microbial causes, although he
   does continue to have VRE growing through -antibiotics that should
   cover it, suggesting an ongoing source for bacterial infection.
   - PPI bolus+drip
   - crossmatch 4 units, transfusing 2 units PRBCs
   - 2 units platelets
   - blood products in setting of fever is suboptimal; will give IVF
   boluses if fever rising and hemodynamics stable
   - one unit FFP if INR down
   - GI consult much appreciated; appreciate prelim recs of watchful
   waiting, PPI, blood product support, trying to avoid endoscopy in the
   setting of profound neutropenia
   - q4h Hcts
   - HSV and CMV viral loads
   FEVER AND RASH
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion. Further discussion of infection is below.
   - tylenol if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool if fever
   continues to go to these high levels
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs, much
   appreciate ID service ongoing involvement and counsel
   ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from Mr [**Known lastname 4258**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6462**] for many days now despite
   several different approaches to treating it including daptomycin,
   linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin; nonetheless, gram positive
   cocci, most likely continued VRE infection, are growing out of bottles
   drawn as recently as this morning. Clot in cephalic vein must be
   presumed to be now seeded with VRE. Though previous TTE was negative,
   endocarditis is increasingly likely, although his peripherhal petichiae
   are not entirely c/w septic emboli.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopping aztreonam and substituting meropenem
   - if infectious signs continue, consider TTE; would not change acute
   mgmt
   - given cephalic clot, cover long-term for endovascular infection
   AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim.
   - will increase filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. Have held
   both. Monitor stools for guaiac. History of diarrhea before this acute
   event raises the question of whether this might have been the result of
   then-undetected GI bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile for an extended period, and the fever has not responded to antibiotics. This suggests the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Endovascular infection: The patient has a clot in the cephalic vein, which may be seeded with VRE. This increases the risk of endovascular infection, which can be life-threatening.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's peripherhal petichiae are not entirely consistent with septic emboli, but the presence of a clot in the cephalic vein increases the risk of endocarditis.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and his platelet count is low. This increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the GI tract or intracranial bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. This suggests that he may be at risk for respiratory failure, especially if his condition deteriorates.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, and the VRE infection has not responded to treatment. This suggests the possibility of infection-related complications, such as septic shock or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
7. Leukemia-related complications: The patient has acute myeloid leukemia, and his bone marrow is reportedly in remission. However, he is still at risk for leukemia-related complications, such as relapse or secondary infections.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin, gentamicin, and meropenem. These antibiotics are being used to treat the VRE infection.
2. Blood products: The patient is receiving blood products, including platelets and red blood cells, to support his hematologic status.
3. Supportive care: The patient is receiving supportive care, including hydration, nutrition, and pain management.
4. Filgrastim: The patient is receiving filgrastim to support his bone marrow recovery.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and his treatment plan is being adjusted as necessary to address his ongoing medical complications."

   # FEVER AND RASH
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion
   - Tylenol for T>102 if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs
   - ID recs
   # ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from cultures for many days now despite treatment
   with daptomycin, linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin;
   nonetheless, gram positive cocci, most likely continued VRE infection,
   are growing out of bottles drawn as recently as [**5-19**]. Clot in cephalic
   vein must be presumed to be now seeded with VRE.  [**Month (only) 8**] be chronically
   seeding from GI source. Though previous TTE was negative, endocarditis
   is increasingly likely, that said a repeat negative TTE would not rule
   out and TEE would not be pursued for the same reasons as EGD.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopped aztreonam and started meropenem overnight
   - given cephalic clot, will need long-term ABX for endovascular
   infection
   # AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim. Per his oncologist, he is entering
   the window during which counts usually recover, his bone marrow biopsy
   shows that Tx has been effective in eliminating AML.  Likely that he
   will be able to clear infection when counts recover.
   - increased filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   # DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. These have
   been stopped. Monitor stools for guaiac. Diarrhea may explain his high
   requirements for potassium repletion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. GI Bleed: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia. The risk of bleeding is increased with the use of anticoagulant medications and the presence of a cephalic clot.
2. Ongoing Infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics, and has been growing despite treatment. This increases the risk of sepsis and endocarditis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged INR increase the risk of bleeding and coagulopathy.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level may be related to his GI bleed, and further monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
5. Leukemia: The patient has acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is a life-threatening condition. The patient is on a clinical trial protocol and is expected to recover from his treatment.
6. Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia increases his risk of infection and sepsis.
7. Rash: The patient has developed a morbilliform rash, which may be related to a drug reaction or infection.
8. Fever: The patient's high fever may be related to his ongoing infection or sepsis.
9. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be related to his infection or medication use, and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued antibiotics for VRE bacteremia
2. Anticoagulation therapy to prevent further bleeding
3. Blood product support to maintain platelet and white blood cell counts
4. Filgrastim to stimulate white blood cell production
5. Monitoring of electrolyte levels to prevent complications
6. Close monitoring of the patient's clinical status and laboratory results to adjust treatment as necessary."

   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion
   - Tylenol for T>102 if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs
   - ID recs
   # ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from cultures for many days now despite treatment
   with daptomycin, linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin;
   nonetheless, gram positive cocci, most likely continued VRE infection,
   are growing out of bottles drawn as recently as [**5-19**]. Clot in cephalic
   vein must be presumed to be now seeded with VRE.  [**Month (only) 8**] be chronically
   seeding from GI source. Though previous TTE was negative, endocarditis
   is increasingly likely, that said a repeat negative TTE would not rule
   out and TEE would not be pursued for the same reasons as EGD.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopped aztreonam and started meropenem overnight
   - given cephalic clot, will need long-term ABX for endovascular
   infection
   # AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim. Per his oncologist, he is entering
   the window during which counts usually recover, his bone marrow biopsy
   shows that Tx has been effective in eliminating AML.  Likely that he
   will be able to clear infection when counts recover.
   - increased filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   # DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. These have
   been stopped. Monitor stools for guaiac. Diarrhea may explain his high
   requirements for potassium repletion

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 4258**] has received 3 units pRBC's overnight and platelet transfusion
   too. He has remained febrile despite tylenol and antibiotics. He denies
   abdominal pain or emesis.
   Exam notable for Tm of 105 BP 108/66 HR of 94 RR of 30 with sats of
   100% on 2lpm O2 . His MM are dry and crusted. His lung fields are clear
   and there is minimal ankle edema. He does have a diffuse maculopapular
   rash. Labs notable for WBC 0.1 K, HCT 26.8 , plts of 28K, K+  2.9, Cr
   0.7 . CXR with clear lung fields and no effusions.
   Agree with plan to follow Hct / plts closely and relpete with pRBC/
   platelet transfusions as appropriate .he has poor IV access and his
   needs have escalated with ongoing GI bleed. Despite peristent
   bacteremia, he will need CVL access for short term to keep up with Hct/
   plt support. He will receive tylenol/ demerol for fevers and hopefully
   with immune reconstitution, will have clearance of bacteremia. Follow
   up echo to be ordered this week to r/ o endocarditis. Antibiotics to
   continue per ID recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED
   Acute bleed in the setting of neutropenia and leukopenia, as well as
   thrombocytopenia. This setting both increases bleeding risk from
   ordinary causes of GIB (e.g., PUD, AVM, etc); and also raises the
   question of infectious causes (e.g., HSV, CMV; or an erosive
   esophagitis). He is well covered for most microbial causes, including
   HSV at his current dose of acyclovir. CMV viral load was recently
   negative.
   - PPI bolus+drip
   - q6h checks of Hct, plts, coags
   - active T+S and transfuse for Hct less than 25
   - transfuse plts for less than 50 given active bleed
   - Fibrinogen for increases in INR
   - blood products in setting of fever is suboptimal; will give IVF
   boluses if fever rising and hemodynamics stable
   - GI consult much appreciated; appreciate prelim recs of watchful
   waiting, PPI, blood product support, trying to avoid endoscopy in the
   setting of profound neutropenia
   - HSV serologies
   # FEVER AND RASH
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile for an extended period, and despite antibiotics, the fever persists. This increases the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) in place, and there is a risk of endocarditis due to the presence of VRE bacteremia. This can lead to cardiac complications and even death.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and the current situation with melena and hematemesis increases the risk of further bleeding. This can lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
4. Leukopenia: The patient has neutropenia, which increases the risk of infections, particularly fungal and viral infections.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, which can lead to muscle cramps, arrhythmias, and seizures.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and the current situation with pneumonia and respiratory acidosis increases the risk of further respiratory failure.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, and the current situation with endocarditis and bacteremia increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these potential complications."

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Unclear cause, although most likely would be infectious
   esophagitis (e.g. HSV, CMV) in the settting of profound
   immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include ulcer.
   Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is unstable and/or
   counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q6h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**]
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  Blood
   cultures growing this daily 5/8/5/16.  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**] -
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] -
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl. Drug fever is also a concern.
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion
   - Tylenol for T>102 if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs
   - ID recs
   # ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from cultures for many days now despite treatment
   with daptomycin, linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin;
   nonetheless, gram positive cocci, most likely continued VRE infection,
   are growing out of bottles drawn as recently as [**5-19**]. Clot in cephalic
   vein must be presumed to be now seeded with VRE.  [**Month (only) 8**] be chronically
   seeding from GI source. Though previous TTE was negative, endocarditis
   is increasingly likely, that said a repeat negative TTE would not rule
   out and TEE would not be pursued for the same reasons as EGD.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopped aztreonam and started meropenem overnight
   - given cephalic clot, will need long-term ABX for endovascular
   infection
   # AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim. Per his oncologist, he is entering
   the window during which counts usually recover, his bone marrow biopsy
   shows that Tx has been effective in eliminating AML.  Likely that he
   will be able to clear infection when counts recover.
   - increased filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   # DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. These have
   been stopped. Monitor stools for guaiac. Diarrhea may explain his high
   requirements for potassium repletion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with daptomycin, linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin;
   nonetheless, gram positive cocci, most likely continued VRE infection,
   are growing out of bottles drawn as recently as [**5-19**]. Clot in cephalic
   vein must be presumed to be now seeded with VRE.  [**Month (only) 8**] be chronically
   seeding from GI source. Though previous TTE was negative, endocarditis
   is increasingly likely, that said a repeat negative TTE would not rule
   out and TEE would not be pursued for the same reasons as EGD.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopped aztreonam and started meropenem overnight
   - given cephalic clot, will need long-term ABX for endovascular
   infection
   # AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim. Per his oncologist, he is entering
   the window during which counts usually recover, his bone marrow biopsy
   shows that Tx has been effective in eliminating AML.  Likely that he
   will be able to clear infection when counts recover.
   - increased filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   # DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. These have
   been stopped. Monitor stools for guaiac. Diarrhea may explain his high
   requirements for potassium repletion

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is undergoing chemotherapy. He has developed pancytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia, and is febrile with a temperature of 103.5°F. He has a morbilliform rash, which may be a drug reaction. He has been on multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin, linezolid, and vancomycin, but still has VRE bacteremia. He has also developed acute gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely secondary to infectious esophagitis or ulcer. His laboratory results show elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, indicating liver dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's VRE bacteremia and the presence of a clot in his cephalic vein may increase the risk of endocarditis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to further complications, including hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalance.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and increased risk of infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is decreased, which may indicate respiratory failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and acidosis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are decreased, which may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may indicate coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding.
9. Infection: The patient's ongoing VRE bacteremia and the presence of a clot in his cephalic vein may increase the risk of further infection.
10. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to hemorrhagic complications, including bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, intracranial bleeding, or bleeding from the surgical site.

Based on the patient's laboratory results, imaging studies, and clinical presentation, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications early on and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV
   or CMV in the settting of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential
   causes would include ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy
   unless he is unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  The source
   of his bacteremia (despite adequate antibiotics) is not clear.  He does
   have a history of superficial cephalic vein clot that could be seeded.
   He has had a TTE that was negative for clot a week ago, but this could
   be another source if he has a new/occult clot.  Finally, given GI bleed
   would need to consider an intra-abdominal source (he had a history of
   typhlitis last month).   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE
   [**5-11**]-/[**5-19**].  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**] -
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] -
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, and we will keep this in mind as we
   investigate and treat his VRE bacteremia..
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - repeat TTE today; will pursue TEE when able to lie flat and counts
   have improved
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight most
   likely represented volume overload.  He did receive multiple blood
   products and a bolus just prior to this and was considerably net
   positive for the day.  Much improved now s/p diuresis.
   - check CVP to evaluate volume status
   - consider gentle diuresis if volume up
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV
   or CMV in the settting of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential
   causes would include ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy
   unless he is unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  The source
   of his bacteremia (despite adequate antibiotics) is not clear.  He does
   have a history of superficial cephalic vein clot that could be seeded.
   He has had a TTE that was negative for clot a week ago, but this could
   be another source if he has a new/occult clot.  Finally, given GI bleed
   would need to consider an intra-abdominal source (he had a history of
   typhlitis last month).   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE
   [**5-11**]-/[**5-19**].  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**] -
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] -
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, and we will keep this in mind as we
   investigate and treat his VRE bacteremia..
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - repeat TTE today; will pursue TEE when able to lie flat and counts
   have improved
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight most
   likely represented volume overload.  He did receive multiple blood
   products and a bolus just prior to this and was considerably net
   positive for the day.  Much improved now s/p diuresis.
   - check CVP to evaluate volume status
   - consider gentle diuresis if volume up
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). He is profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent VRE bacteremia, and has experienced hematemesis and melena consistent with acute GI bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: Tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea
* Respiratory support: High-flow oxygen and non-invasive ventilation
* Cardiovascular: Normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs
* Neurological: Alert and oriented, no focal neurological deficits
* Renal: Normal creatinine and blood urea nitrogen
* Hepatic: Normal liver function tests
* Hematological: Pancytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia
* Coagulation: Coagulopathy, low fibrinogen
* Infectious: VRE bacteremia, pending CMV and HSV viral loads
* Gastrointestinal: Acute GI bleed, possible causes include infectious esophagitis, ulcer, or other underlying conditions

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's VRE bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and pancytopenia increase the risk of bleeding, which may be exacerbated by the GI bleed.
3. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and immunosuppression make him susceptible to infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections.
4. Organ failure: The patient's coagulopathy, anemia, and pancytopenia may lead to organ failure, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
7. GI perforation: The patient's acute GI bleed may lead to GI perforation, which can cause peritonitis and sepsis.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's GI bleed may lead to pancreatitis, which can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for VRE bacteremia
* Transfusion of blood products to correct anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Supportive care for respiratory and cardiovascular instability
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis, bleeding, and organ failure
* Consideration of GI endoscopy and CT torso to evaluate the cause of the GI bleed
* F/u of CMV and HSV viral loads to determine the cause of the fever and potential underlying infections.

The patient's code status is ""resuscitate but no intubation,"" indicating that he should receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation if his heart stops, but he should not be intubated or receive mechanical ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient's chief complaint is a fever of 103.9°F, which is concerning for sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22,000 cells/μL, which is elevated, indicating an active infection. The blood culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, consistent with a bacterial infection. The patient's hemodynamic parameters are stable, with a heart rate of 124 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 117/80 mmHg.

The patient has developed pulmonary edema, which is a life-threatening complication, and has required non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) to manage this condition. The patient's respiratory support is being managed with a bipap mask, and their oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient has also developed pancytopenia, which is a significant complication, and is at risk for bleeding and infection. The patient's platelet count is 20,000 cells/μL, which is low, and their hemoglobin is 11.3 g/dL, which is low.

The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as they are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, and their glucose levels are elevated at 164 mg/dL.

The patient's mental status is altered, and they are at risk for delirium due to their critical illness. The patient's coagulation status is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2, which is slightly elevated.

The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a calcium level of 7.7 mg/dL, which is low, and a magnesium level of 1.6 mg/dL, which is low.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent blood transfusion, which may have contributed to their anemia and pancytopenia. The patient's family history is significant for a history of cancer.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, as well as supportive care, including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest that they may be developing sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary edema and positive blood culture suggest that they may have developed pneumonia.
3. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia and low platelet count make them at risk for bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count and positive blood culture suggest that they may be at risk for infection.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and critical illness make them at risk for delirium.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level makes them at risk for hypocalcemia.
7. Leukemia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal blood smear suggest that they may have developed leukemia.

The patient's potential treatment options include:

1. Antibiotics: The patient may require antibiotics to treat their infection.
2. Antifungals: The patient may require antifungals to treat their fungal infection.
3. Antivirals: The patient may require antivirals to treat their viral infection.
4. Supportive care: The patient may require supportive care, including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and hemodynamic monitoring.
5. Blood transfusions: The patient may require blood transfusions to treat their anemia and pancytopenia.
6. Chemotherapy: The patient may require chemotherapy to treat their leukemia."

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV
   or CMV in the settting of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential
   causes would include ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy
   unless he is unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  The source
   of his bacteremia (despite adequate antibiotics) is not clear.  He does
   have a history of superficial cephalic vein clot that could be seeded.
   He has had a TTE that was negative for clot a week ago, but this could
   be another source if he has a new/occult clot.  Finally, given GI bleed
   would need to consider an intra-abdominal source (he had a history of
   typhlitis last month).   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE
   [**5-11**]-/[**5-19**].  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]

   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, and we will keep this in mind as we
   investigate and treat his VRE bacteremia..
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - repeat TTE today; will pursue TEE when able to lie flat and counts
   have improved
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight most
   likely represented volume overload.  He did receive multiple blood
   products and a bolus just prior to this and was considerably net
   positive for the day.  Much improved now s/p diuresis.
   - check CVP to evaluate volume status
   - consider gentle diuresis if volume up
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's condition is complex and multi-systemic, with several potential complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has experienced two episodes of pulmonary edema, which may be related to volume overload, VRE infection, or other underlying conditions.
2. Anemia and pancytopenia: The patient has acute anemia and pancytopenia secondary to blood loss and chemotherapy.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, and the source of the bacteremia is not clear.
4. GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which may be related to infectious esophagitis, ulcers, or other causes.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may be related to his underlying condition and treatment.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, which may be related to his underlying condition and treatment.
7. Leukemia: The patient has AML, which is being treated with chemotherapy.
8. Rash: The patient has a rash, which may be related to his underlying condition, treatment, or other causes.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 0.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 20
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.16 ng/mL
* TCO2: 17 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 2.5 mmol/L
* LDH: 465 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 1.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): normal
* Computed tomography (CT) torso: pending
* KUB: pending

The patient's medications include:

* Cefepime
* Vancomycin
* Linezolid
* Daptomycin
* Gentamicin
* Meropenem
* Metronidazole
* Voriconazole
* Acyclovir
* Tylenol
* Meperidine
* Filgrastim

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue antibiotics for VRE bacteremia
* Continue antifungal therapy
* Continue antiviral therapy
* Repeat TTE and CT torso when able to lie flat and counts have improved
* Pursue endoscopy if GI bleed is unstable or counts recover

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach,.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach,.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleed. He is requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary edema and shortness of breath. The patient has a decreased ejection fraction, and his cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting myocardial ischemia/infarction. He has also developed a rash, and his platelet count is low.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and shortness of breath may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his decreased ejection fraction and elevated cardiac enzymes.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent VRE bacteremia and neutropenia may lead to sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and elevated cardiac enzymes may increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed may lead to further hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and ongoing bleeding may lead to coagulopathy, which could increase his risk of bleeding complications.
6. Leukemia Progression: The patient's AML may progress despite chemotherapy, which could lead to further complications and decreased quality of life.
7. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and ongoing bacteremia may lead to further infections, which could be life-threatening.
8. Organ Failure: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and elevated cardiac enzymes may lead to organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
9. Hyperthermia: The patient's fever may lead to hyperthermia, which could be life-threatening.
10. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels may lead to hypocalcemia, which could be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue Bi-PAP for pulmonary edema and shortness of breath.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and ejection fraction closely.
3. Consider adding a vasopressor to support blood pressure.
4. Continue antibiotics for VRE bacteremia and neutropenic fever.
5. Consider adding antifungal therapy for possible fungal infection.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk closely.
7. Continue captopril for afterload reduction.
8. Consider adding a diuretic to support fluid removal.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including calcium, closely.
10. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis medication.

Note: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which means that the patient has chosen not to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the event of cardiac arrest."

   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]

   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight,
   likely [**2-6**] flash pulmonary edema, associated with decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis as tolerated
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood

   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute GI bleed.

The patient's condition is critical, with multiple potential complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which resolved with diuresis and non-invasive ventilation.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has severe neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, and a trial of linezolid is being considered to clarify whether the infection is inadequately treated or due to an inadequately treated source.
4. GI Bleed: The patient has hematemesis and melena, which may be due to infectious esophagitis, ulcer, or other causes.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient has decreased ejection fraction, worsening cardiac enzymes, and focal wall motion abnormalities, which may be indicative of myocardial ischemia/infarction.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient had an episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, which may be related to flash pulmonary edema.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, which may be related to sepsis or other causes.
9. Leukemia: The patient has AML, which is being treated with cytarabine and clofarabine, and is at risk for relapse.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for VRE bacteremia, GI bleed, and cardiac complications, including linezolid, meropenem, gentamicin, and voriconazole. The patient is also receiving supportive care, including non-invasive ventilation, diuresis, and blood transfusions.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the family has been informed of the patient's condition. The patient's disposition is uncertain, but the goal is to manage his symptoms and stabilize his condition to allow for further treatment and potential discharge."

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach,.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach,.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]

   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]

   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted for chemotherapy. He is currently in the ICU due to profound neutropenia, febrile with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute GI bleed. He requires Bi-PAP for pulmonary edema and shortness of breath.

The patient's current conditions include:

* Pneumonia with flash pulmonary edema
* Tachycardia
* GI bleed
* Fever
* Anemia and pancytopenia
* Coagulopathy
* Hypocalcemia
* Leukemia
* Rash
* Neutropenia

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure
2. Further GI bleeding and hemodynamic instability
3. Development of septic shock
4. Progression of leukemia and bone marrow failure
5. Increased risk of infections due to neutropenia
6. Potential for cardiac complications due to decreased ejection fraction and tachycardia
7. Risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
8. Hypocalcemia and potential for cardiac arrhythmias
9. Risk of further organ dysfunction due to underlying disease and treatment

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue Bi-PAP and gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
2. Trial of IVF today given that patient may be dry due to lasix and IV lopressor
3. Continue Q6 Hct checks and transfuse to Hct >30
4. Continue PPI gtt and f/u GI recs
5. F/u CMV and HSV viral loads
6. Continue acyclovir and clarify with ID
7. Continue linezolid and gentamicin, and consider adding other antibiotics if necessary
8. Support Hct >30 and continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
9. Trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
10. Continue filgrastim and f/u heme/onc recs
11. Continue TPN without lipids and monitor glycemic control
12. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight,
   likely [**2-6**] flash pulmonary edema, associated with decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis as tolerated
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient had two episodes of flash pulmonary edema, one on [**2136-5-21**] 10:10 PM and another on [**2136-5-22**] 04:00 AM. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and has been treated with lasix.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has a significant drop in white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding).
4. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach often occuring in the setting of fevers/rigors, but
   unclear why patient still having worsening sinus tach throughout the
   course of the day.  Tachycardia could be related to heart failure and
   worsening EF.  Pt maintaining blood pressures.
   - Consider standing low dose metoprolol for sinus tach, given reduced
   EF
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach often occuring in the setting of fevers/rigors, but
   unclear why patient still having worsening sinus tach throughout the
   course of the day.  Tachycardia could be related to heart failure and
   worsening EF.  Pt maintaining blood pressures.
   - Consider standing low dose metoprolol for sinus tach, given reduced
   EF
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has flash pulmonary edema, which is worsening, and is requiring Bi-PAP for respiratory support.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is up to 150 beats per minute, which is concerning for potential cardiac complications.
3. GI bleed: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, which is likely related to the GI bleed, and may be secondary to infectious esophagitis or an ulcer.
4. Fever: The patient's fever is likely secondary to the ongoing VRE infection, and the source of the bacteremia is unclear.
5. Decreased ejection fraction: The patient's ejection fraction is decreasing, which is concerning for potential cardiac complications.
6. Leukemia: The patient has AML, and is currently receiving chemotherapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and decreased ejection fraction increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and tachypnea increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. GI complications: The patient's GI bleed and neutropenia increase the risk of GI complications, such as perforation, abscess, or sepsis.
4. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and immunosuppression increase the risk of infection, which may be secondary to the VRE bacteremia or other pathogens.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's decreased hemoglobin level and ongoing bleeding increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding into the brain, eyes, or other organs.

To manage these potential complications, the patient is receiving:

1. Bi-PAP for respiratory support
2. Lasix for diuresis
3. Linezolid for antibiotic treatment
4. Gentamicin for antibiotic treatment
5. Voriconazole for antifungal treatment
6. Meropenem for antibiotic treatment
7. Flagyl for antibiotic treatment
8. Captopril for afterload reduction
9. Filgrastim for neutropenia support
10. TPN without lipids for nutrition

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is unknown at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 24-year-old individual with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone chemotherapy and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
* The patient is experiencing ongoing fevers, rigors, and sinus tachycardia, which is somewhat reduced by metoprolol.
* The patient has a diffuse bilateral infiltrative pulmonary process, as evidenced by a portable chest X-ray, which continues to worsen, particularly on the right side.
* The patient is receiving BiPAP respiratory support and has a SpO2 of 99%.
* The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a Tmax of 103.2°F and a CVP of 13 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and pain management medications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Pneumonia: Given the patient's diffuse bilateral infiltrative pulmonary process, there is a high risk of developing pneumonia, which could further compromise respiratory function.
* Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fevers, rigors, and sinus tachycardia suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary process and requirement for BiPAP respiratory support suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's history of UGIB and ongoing bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy suggest a high risk of hemorrhagic complications, including bleeding from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and AML, combined with the presence of central lines and other invasive devices, increases the risk of infection, including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter-related urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypertension suggest a high risk of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's current status is characterized by ongoing respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, and potential bleeding complications.
* The patient requires continued close monitoring and management in the ICU, including aggressive treatment of respiratory failure, sepsis, and hemorrhagic complications.
* The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and enteral nutrition should be considered to support recovery.
* The patient's mental status is altered, and ongoing assessment and management are necessary to prevent delirium and other cognitive complications.
* The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and ongoing discussion with the family is necessary to ensure that the patient's wishes are respected.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, including oxygenation and ventilation, and consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
* Aggressively manage sepsis and hemorrhagic complications, including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood products as necessary.
* Consider enteral nutrition to support recovery and prevent malnutrition.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and provide ongoing assessment and management to prevent delirium and other cognitive complications.
* Ongoing discussion with the family is necessary to ensure that the patient's wishes are respected and to provide support and guidance throughout the patient's care."

   64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and had hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, previous CXR consistent
   with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection fraction;
   showing improvement s/p diuresis. Current CVP does not imply fluid
   overload.   Also need to consider possibiluty of early ARDS given
   persistent bacterimia, TRALI given recent transfusions, and PE given hx
   of other thrombosis (cephalic vein).
   - Continue BiPAP, intubation is not an option as he is DNI; need to
   recheck ABG (last over 24hrs ago)
   - Consider CTA to assess for PE and also lung parenchyma although pt
   not currently able to lie flat; f/u LENIs
   - Minimize fluid volumes with Abx and other meds as per pharmacy
   - Daily weights for better eval of volume status as incontinent and not
   candidate for foley
   - Monitor CVP and dose lasix prn
   - Daily CXR
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on 12-lead. [**Month (only) 8**] be compensatory for decreased
   EF or may be [**2-6**] fevers and persistent infxn.  Pt maintaining blood
   pressures at high rates.  Trop leak likely [**2-6**] demand from high rate.
   Currently euvolemic as by CVP
s. Rates centered in low 100s which is an
   improvement since yesterday when he frequently averaged in 140s.
   - Continue prn order for metoprolol for HR>130
   - repeat 12-lead
   # GI BLEED:  Hct relatively stable and has not required transfusion for
   over 24hrs. By report, has not been putting out as much melanotic
   stool. Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV
   in the settting of profound imunosuppression).  Other potential causes
   would include ulcer; nothing to suggest liver.  - continue Q6 Hct
   checks; last Hct this morning 30.1
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >26, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs; No plan for endoscopy unless he is unstable and/or
   counts recover.
   - CMV viral load negative
   - fu/ HSV seologies; continue acyclovir
   # FEVER/ Neutropenia:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection
   which is now shown to be daptomycin resistant.  . The source of his
   abx-refractory bacteremia is unclear; cephalic vein clot, endocarditis
   not seen by TTE, or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.
   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE. ABX course as outlined
   above. In theory, will likely
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + voriconazole.  He will
   likely be more able to clear the infection when his WBC recover.
   Another potential source of fever could be a drug reaction, although we
   had hoped that this might have been from aztreonam and given that his
   fevers continue after d/c
ing this medication and without significant
   worsening of his morbilliform rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing
   source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above;       Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole and meropenem for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   - US of UE to determine if Cephalic vein clot persists, if so, would
   consider possiblity of thrombectomy
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation most likely [**2-6**] demand in setting of
   tachycardia ans not representive of ACS. Difficult to intervene at this
   point given GI bleed.
   - support Hct >26
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and had hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, previous CXR consistent
   with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection fraction;
   showing improvement s/p diuresis. Current CVP does not imply fluid
   overload.   Also need to consider possibiluty of early ARDS given
   persistent bacterimia, TRALI given recent transfusions, and PE given hx
   of other thrombosis (cephalic vein).
   - Continue BiPAP, intubation is not an option as he is DNI; need to
   recheck ABG (last over 24hrs ago)
   - Consider CTA to assess for PE and also lung parenchyma although pt
   not currently able to lie flat; f/u LENIs
   - Minimize fluid volumes with Abx and other meds as per pharmacy
   - Daily weights for better eval of volume status as incontinent and not
   candidate for foley
   - Monitor CVP and dose lasix prn
   - Daily CXR
   #Tachycardia: Sinus tach on 12-lead. [**Month (only) 8**] be compensatory for decreased
   EF or may be [**2-6**] fevers and persistent infxn.  Pt maintaining blood
   pressures at high rates.  Trop leak likely [**2-6**] demand from high rate.
   Currently euvolemic as by CVP
s. Rates centered in low 100s which is an
   improvement since yesterday when he frequently averaged in 140s.
   - Continue prn order for metoprolol for HR>130
   - repeat 12-lead
   # GI BLEED:  Hct relatively stable and has not required transfusion for
   over 24hrs. By report, has not been putting out as much melanotic
   stool. Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV
   in the settting of profound imunosuppression).  Other potential causes
   would include ulcer; nothing to suggest liver.  - continue Q6 Hct
   checks; last Hct this morning 30.1
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >26, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs; No plan for endoscopy unless he is unstable and/or
   counts recover.
   - CMV viral load negative
   - fu/ HSV seologies; continue acyclovir
   # FEVER/ Neutropenia:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection
   which is now shown to be daptomycin resistant.  . The source of his
   abx-refractory bacteremia is unclear; cephalic vein clot, endocarditis
   not seen by TTE, or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.
   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE. ABX course as outlined
   above. In theory, will likely
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + voriconazole.  He will
   likely be more able to clear the infection when his WBC recover.
   Another potential source of fever could be a drug reaction, although we
   had hoped that this might have been from aztreonam and given that his
   fevers continue after d/c
ing this medication and without significant
   worsening of his morbilliform rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing
   source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above;       Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole and meropenem for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   - US of UE to determine if Cephalic vein clot persists, if so, would
   consider possiblity of thrombectomy
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation most likely [**2-6**] demand in setting of
   tachycardia ans not representive of ACS. Difficult to intervene at this
   point given GI bleed.
   - support Hct >26
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted to the hospital for chemotherapy. He developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found to have a daptomycin-resistant Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. He is currently febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic, requiring BiPAP for pulmonary edema. He has a history of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: Worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, which may be related to flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, TRALI, or PE.
2. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia may be due to decreased ejection fraction, fever, or infection.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of UGIB and melena, which may be related to infectious esophagitis, ulcer, or other causes.
4. Fever/Neutropenia: The patient's fever and neutropenia may be secondary to ongoing VRE infection, which is resistant to daptomycin.
5. Decreased EF: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting myocardial ischemia/infarction, although the elevation may be due to tachycardia rather than ACS.
6. AML: The patient has a history of AML and is currently receiving chemotherapy, which may be causing his symptoms.

Recommendations:

1. Continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery and manage pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor CVP and dose lasix prn to minimize fluid volumes.
3. Consider CTA to assess for PE and lung parenchyma, although the patient is unable to lie flat.
4. Monitor Hct and fibrinogen levels, and transfuse as necessary.
5. Continue antibiotic therapy with linezolid, meropenem, and voriconazole for empiric coverage of neutropenic fever.
6. Consider US of UE to determine if Cephalic vein clot persists, and consider thrombectomy if necessary.
7. Support Hct >26 and continue captopril for afterload reduction.
8. Continue filgrastim to stimulate white blood cell production.
9. F/u heme/onc recs to manage AML.
10. Monitor glycemic control and adjust therapy as necessary."

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach often occuring in the setting of fevers/rigors, but
   unclear why patient still having worsening sinus tach throughout the
   course of the day.  Tachycardia could be related to heart failure and
   worsening EF.  Pt maintaining blood pressures.
   - Consider standing low dose metoprolol for sinus tach, given reduced
   EF
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment, who has developed severe neutropenia, febrile, and is experiencing hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has developed flash pulmonary edema, which is likely related to decreased ejection fraction and may be worsened by his tachycardia.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has been increasing, with a maximum of 150 beats per minute, which may be related to heart failure, worsening ejection fraction, or other factors.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has ongoing hematemesis and melena, which may be related to infectious esophagitis, ulcers, or other causes. The patient's hematocrit is trending downward, and he is receiving transfusions to maintain a hematocrit above 30.
4. Fever: The patient's fever is likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, which has been resistant to daptomycin. The patient is currently receiving linezolid and other antibiotics to treat the infection.
5. Decreased ejection fraction: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he has focal wall motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia or infarction.
6. Leukemia: The patient has AML, which is being treated with cytarabine and clofarabine, and he has achieved remission on recent bone marrow biopsy.
7. Pancytopenia: The patient is profoundly neutropenic, with a white blood cell count of 0.1 k/uL.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, which may be related to his leukemia treatment or other factors.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR), which may be related to his leukemia treatment or other factors.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if his heart failure is not adequately treated.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and immunosuppression make him susceptible to infection, which may be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Myocardial infarction or ischemia: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest that he may be at risk for myocardial infarction or ischemia.
6. Seizures: The patient's use of linezolid and meperidine may increase his risk of seizures, particularly if his white blood cell count remains low.
7. Renal failure: The patient's pancytopenia and immunosuppression may increase his risk of renal failure, particularly if he develops sepsis or other complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify potential complications early and institute appropriate interventions."
