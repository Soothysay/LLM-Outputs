   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old man with likely microscopic polyangiitis and now with
   transient fevers and hypoxia of unclear etiology, now transferred to
   the MICU service for ongoing care.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Fevers: unclear etiology; could be pneumonia, though must rule out
   vasculitis-related etiologies
   - cont empiric levofloxacin; f/u pending micro data from here and
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - bronchoscopy this afternoon to eval for alveolar hemorrhage; send BAL
   for micro
   - f/u beta-D-glucan, galactomannan, parvovirus, CMV serologies;
   - Legionella antigen and Lyme serologies negative
   - prn meperidine for rigors
   .
   ## Microscopic polyangiitis
   - rheumatology consult called this morning by CCU team; f/u recs
   - cont prednisone 60 mg daily for now pending rheum recs; TMP/SMX for
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]; vitamin D/calcium for bone prophylaxis
   - f/u ANCA titer
   .
   ## Hypoxia; transient with fevers/rigors
   - bronchoscopy this afternoon
   - follow CXRs
   .
   ## Pancytopenia: leukopenia and anemia seemingly have resolved this
   morning, though wonder if this could be a lab artifact given marked
   change in Hgb/Hct; likely a sequela of azathioprine use
   - cont holding azathioprine for now
   - recheck CBC
   - f/u parasite smear for Babesia, SPEP/UPEP
   - consider heme consult if persistent
   - add on LDH, reticulocyte count, TBili, haptoglobin
   .
   ## CAD s/p CABG; minor troponin-T elevation likely from acute medical
   stressors and not representative of ACS/NSTEMI
   - cont aspirin; resume beta blocker once stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation
   - cont warfarin
   - cont holding beta blockade for now given possibility of ongoing
   infection
   - follow INR given antibiotics most likely to change it

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a complex medical history, including microscopic polyangiitis, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease with a previous CABG.

The patient was transferred to the MICU service due to transient fevers and hypoxia of unclear etiology. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which are improving. The patient's troponin-T level is mildly elevated, likely due to acute medical stressors rather than ACS/NSTEMI.

The patient's medications include empiric levofloxacin for fevers, prednisone for microscopic polyangiitis, and warfarin for atrial fibrillation. The patient is also receiving vitamin D and calcium for bone prophylaxis.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's fevers and hypoxia could be related to pneumonia, which needs to be ruled out.
2. Vasculitis-related etiologies: The patient's microscopic polyangiitis may be causing the fevers and hypoxia.
3. Alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's bronchoscopy this afternoon will evaluate for alveolar hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient's antibiotics may be causing the minor troponin-T elevation.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure.
7. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and hypoxia may be related to sepsis.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Bronchoscopy to evaluate for alveolar hemorrhage and rule out pneumonia.
2. Continued empiric levofloxacin for fevers.
3. Consultation with rheumatology for microscopic polyangiitis.
4. Monitoring of the patient's laboratory results, including CBC, troponin-T, and other markers of inflammation.
5. Consideration of heme consult if the patient's pancytopenia persists.
6. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cardiovascular status.
7. Adjustments to the patient's medications as necessary."
