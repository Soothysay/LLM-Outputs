   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   #Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye and
   possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental filling
   replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he started
   to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure. Since
   patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the source of
   his enterococcus bacteremia. He is currently hemodynamically stable,
   although he is complaining of numbness in left lower extremity.
   Avoiding gentamicin given Hx of ototoxicity.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but with numbness in the left lower extremity. The patient has been diagnosed with profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high risk of developing further endocarditis due to the dehisced aortic valve and the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.
2. Aortic valve replacement: The patient's aortic valve replacement ring is dehisced, which may lead to further complications such as aortic insufficiency or valve failure.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further anemia, fatigue, and other complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he may be at risk of developing acute renal failure if not properly managed.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries, but he may still be at risk of developing coronary artery disease due to his history of aortic valvuloplasty and AVR.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to his immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 243 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 103 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: showing a right internal jugular catheter terminating in the proximal superior vena cava with no evidence of pneumothorax.
* Head MRI: showing no evidence of aneurysm and stable parenchymal atrophy in the right parietal lobe.
* CT/CTA: showing post-surgical changes with an aortic graft and aortic valve prosthesis, cardiomegaly, and a small left pleural effusion.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin per ID recommendations
* Monitoring for signs of endocarditis and aortic valve failure
* Managing hemolytic anemia with transfusions and close monitoring
* Monitoring for signs of acute renal failure and adjusting treatment as needed
* Monitoring for signs of coronary artery disease and adjusting treatment as needed
* Monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism and adjusting treatment as needed
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment as needed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure optimal treatment outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   #Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye and
   possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental filling
   replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he started
   to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure. Since
   patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the source of
   his enterococcus bacteremia. He is currently hemodynamically stable,
   although he is complaining of numbness in left lower extremity.
   Avoiding gentamicin given Hx of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs
   - ESR/CRP
   - BCx pending
   - MRI/MRA of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Contact [**Name (NI) **] from OSH to check on sterile placement of line.  If
   not sterile consider EJ.
   #Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Start Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70. Reducing sheer force.
   -Continue Heparin gtt
   -Hold carvidolol and warfarin
   -TTE today
   -CTA of Chest/CXR PA/Lateral; full report pending
   #Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic.
   - CT aorta r/o aortoenteric fistula
   - retic count in am pending
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress
   - Tx Hct <21 as no Hx CAD
   # Suspected L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently. will monitor closely for signs of abscess.
   - LLE U/S pending
   - ABIs today with follow up with vascular.
   - Follow pulses
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin leak of 0.37. This is likely secondary to demand ischemia
   secondary to profound anemia.
   -Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   -Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21 as no Hx CAD
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: This note is entered and signed on
   the day after the actual service was performed by me, due to computer
   lockout yesterday.  [**Known firstname 3987**] is stable.  He has aortic root abscess at
   the right fibrous trigone involving the confluence of the anterior
   mitral leaflet and posterior aortic root.  He has had embolic events
   but none recently so I think he is stable from that standpoint.  He
   does not have any large valvular vegetations, and aside freom mild
   paravalvular aortic regurgitation, no major hemodynamically
   compromising valve dysfunction (other than the hemolysis, obviously).
   He aslo has an anastamotic pseudoanerysm at the distal site of the
   aortic graft, which I also think is stable.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   #Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye and
   possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental filling
   replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he started
   to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure. Since
   patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the source of
   his enterococcus bacteremia. He is currently hemodynamically stable,
   although he is complaining of numbness in left lower extremity.
   Avoiding gentamicin given Hx of ototoxicity.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: This note is entered and signed on
   the day after the actual service was performed by me, due to computer
   lockout yesterday.  [**Known firstname 3987**] is stable.  He has aortic root abscess at
   the right fibrous trigone involving the confluence of the anterior
   mitral leaflet and posterior aortic root.  He has had embolic events
   but none recently so I think he is stable from that standpoint.  He
   does not have any large valvular vegetations, and aside freom mild
   paravalvular aortic regurgitation, no major hemodynamically
   compromising valve dysfunction (other than the hemolysis, obviously).
   He aslo has an anastamotic pseudoanerysm at the distal site of the
   aortic graft, which I also think is stable.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of mechanical AVR endocarditis.

The patient has been experiencing symptoms of left hip pain, numbness in the left lower extremity, and dyspnea, which are likely related to the endocarditis. He has also developed anemia, which is suspected to be secondary to hemolytic anemia due to valvular damage.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including a cardiac catheterization, which showed clean coronaries, and a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, which revealed a small left pleural effusion and splenomegaly.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for his endocarditis, including antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. He is also being monitored for signs of acute ischemia, and his hemoglobin level is being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen if he continues to experience hemolysis due to valvular damage.
2. Acute ischemia: The patient's coronary arteries are clean, but he is at risk for acute ischemia due to his anemia and valvular damage.
3. Endocarditis-related complications: The patient's endocarditis may lead to further complications, such as embolic events, abscess formation, or valvular dysfunction.
4. Aortic root abscess: The patient has an aortic root abscess at the right fibrous trigone, which may lead to further complications if not properly treated.
5. Anastomotic pseudoaneurysm: The patient has an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm at the distal site of the aortic graft, which may rupture and lead to further complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased, and he may be at risk for acute renal failure if his kidney function does not improve.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's heart failure may lead to pulmonary edema, which may require further treatment.

In summary, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including worsening anemia, acute ischemia, endocarditis-related complications, aortic root abscess, anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, renal failure, and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, likely caused by dental filling replacement, which led to dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone. He has a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and two aortic valve replacements. He is currently hemodynamically stable, but complaining of numbness in his left lower extremity.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Endocarditis: likely embolic phenomena to the left foot and left eye, and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement: dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch.
3. Anemia: most likely due to hemolysis, possibly with some GI bleed.
4. Suspected Left Foot Embolic Disease: foot appears warm and well-perfused currently, but will be monitored closely for signs of abscess.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: cardiac cath showed clean coronaries, but patient had a troponin leak of 0.37, likely secondary to demand ischemia.
6. Acute Renal Failure: patient's creatinine increased from baseline, likely due to pre-renal etiology, but kidney function is improving.
7. History of Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU): patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his second surgery, but is on suboxone in outpatient care.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications to manage his anemia and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Endocarditis-related complications, such as further embolic events or abscess formation.
2. Aortic valve replacement-related complications, such as valve failure or further dehiscence.
3. Anemia-related complications, such as further bleeding or increased risk of infection.
4. Suspected left foot embolic disease-related complications, such as abscess formation or further embolic events.
5. Coronary artery disease-related complications, such as acute ischemia or infarction.
6. Acute renal failure-related complications, such as further kidney damage or increased risk of infection.
7. History of IVDU-related complications, such as active heroin withdrawal or hepatitis C infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes close monitoring of his condition, continued antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and management of his anemia and other conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who is currently in the ICU due to enterococcal bacteremia and dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring. He has undergone 10 units of packed red blood cell transfusion and is hemodynamically stable. The patient is complaining of numbness in his left lower extremity and has a possible abscess in the fibrous trigone. The patient's laboratory results show profound hemolytic anemia, and he has a history of ototoxicity, which is why gentamicin is being avoided.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Embolic phenomena to the left foot and eye: The patient has a history of endocarditis and a possible abscess in the fibrous trigone, which may lead to embolic events.
2. Aortic valve dehiscence: The patient has a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, which may lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia is likely due to valvular damage and may lead to further complications if not treated.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, and he has a history of hypotensive state, which may lead to acute renal failure.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of demand ischemia secondary to profound anemia, which may lead to coronary artery disease.
6. Aortoenteric fistula: The patient has a history of aortic valve replacement and aortic graft, which may lead to aortoenteric fistula if not treated promptly.
7. Septic shock: The patient has a history of endocarditis and bacteremia, which may lead to septic shock if not treated promptly.
8. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of DVT prophylaxis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy as recommended by the ID consulting service.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including creatinine and hemoglobin levels, to assess for potential complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including echocardiograms and cardiac catheterizations, to assess for potential complications.
5. Consider referring the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for further evaluation and treatment of the aortic valve dehiscence.
6. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further evaluation and treatment of acute renal failure.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent respiratory complications.
8. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and treatment of potential pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone. He has been treated with antibiotics and has stabilized, but is still experiencing hemolytic anemia. The patient has also developed numbness in his left lower extremity, likely due to embolic phenomena. He is currently hemodynamically stable, but at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient is at risk for further endocarditis due to the dehiscent aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone. This could lead to further embolic phenomena, abscess formation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement Complications: The patient's aortic valve replacement is at risk for further complications, including valve failure, thrombosis, and embolization.
3. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia is likely to continue, potentially leading to further complications, such as anemia, jaundice, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
4. Numbness in Left Lower Extremity: The patient's numbness in his left lower extremity is likely due to embolic phenomena and may be a sign of further complications, such as abscess formation or peripheral artery disease.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to pre-renal etiology and may be further complicated by hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac history, including CHF and AVR, puts him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection, particularly endocarditis, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's risk factors for pulmonary embolism, including immobility and central venous catheters, increase his risk for this complication.
9. Stroke: The patient's history of aortic valve replacement and embolic phenomena puts him at risk for stroke, particularly if there is a patent foramen ovale or other cardiac defect.
10. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of IVDU and current use of suboxone increases his risk for hepatitis C infection, which could lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring, and profound hemolytic anemia.

The patient's current condition is stable, but he is at risk for several potential medical complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high risk of developing further embolic phenomena to his left foot and eye, as well as a possible abscess in the fibrous trigone. Close monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of abscess formation or embolic events.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient has a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, which may lead to further complications if left untreated. CT surgery is recommended to repair the valve.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of profound hemolytic anemia, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements is necessary.
4. Suspected Left Foot Embolic Disease: The patient's left foot appears warm and well-perfused currently, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of abscess formation or further embolic events.
5. Coronary Disease: The patient has a history of clean coronaries, but he is at risk for further coronary events due to his anemia and potential demand ischemia.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is at risk for acute renal failure due to his anemia and potential fluid overload. Close monitoring of his renal function and fluid status is necessary.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 243 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 8.8 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 103 mg/dL
* Sodium: 139 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.4 mEq/L
* Chloride: 28 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Ceftriaxone
* Ampicillin
* Heparin sodium
* Metoprolol
* Pantoprazole
* Suboxone

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 70 bpm (60-82 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/66 mmHg (72-122/70 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure is 12 cm, and his pulmonary artery pressure is 25/15 mmHg.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including endocarditis, aortic valve replacement, anemia, suspected left foot embolic disease, coronary disease, and acute renal failure. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, and s/p profound
   hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now stabilized.
   .
   #Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye and
   possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental filling
   replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he started
   to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure. Since
   patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the source of
   his enterococcus bacteremia. He is currently hemodynamically stable,
   although he is complaining of numbness in left lower extremity.
   Avoiding gentamicin given Hx of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will start Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs
   - ESR/CRP
   - BCx pending
   - MRI/MRA of Brain to rule out acute event
   #Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs
   -Start Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70. Goal is to increase
   filling time.
   -Continue Heparin gtt
   -Hold carvidolol and warfarin
   -TTE tomorrow
   -CTA of Chest/CXR PA/Lateral
   #Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic.
   - CT aorta to eval for aortoenteric fistula
   - retic count in am
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress
   - Tx Hct <21 as no Hx CAD
   # Suspected L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently. will monitor closely for signs of abscess.
   - LLE U/S
   - Follow pulses
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin leak of 0.37. This is likely secondary to demand ischemia
   secondary to profound anemia.
   -Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   -Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21 as no Hx CAD
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone, and subsequent profound hemolytic anemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows the patient is hemodynamically stable with a Tmax of 37.5°C, Tcurrent of 36.9°C, HR of 70 bpm, BP of 108/66 mmHg, RR of 29 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 99%.
* Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no signs of pallor, cyanosis, or xanthalesma.
* Laboratory results show a WBC count of 8.8 K/uL, Hct of 29.9%, Plt of 243 K/uL, Cr of 1.2 mg/dL, Glucose of 103 mg/dL, and other labs within normal limits.
* The patient is being treated with Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin, and is awaiting ID consulting and further recommendations.
* The patient's anemia is likely due to hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, and is being treated with Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
* The patient's suspected left foot embolic disease is being monitored closely for signs of abscess.
* The patient's coronary arteries are clean, and he is being monitored for signs of acute ischemia.
* The patient's history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) is being monitored, and he is being treated with suboxone in outpatient settings.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bacteremia and sepsis
* Embolic events to the left foot and eye
* Abscess formation in the fibrous trigone
* Aortoenteric fistula
* Acute ischemia of the coronary arteries
* Active heroin withdrawal
* Hepatitis C serology
* Fluid overload
* AV block
* Hemolytic anemia exacerbation
* Chronic kidney disease
* Chronic anemia
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events due to valvular damage

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment plans as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   #Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia. He is currently hemodynamically
   stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx of ototoxicity. PICC placed
   yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex pending to assess for infectious process in mouth. Dental
   consult will be by today at 4pm.
   #Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70. Reducing sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
   -Hold carvidolol and warfarin
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality. [**Month (only) 60**] consider CABG at
   the same time of replacement if coronaries are damaged
will need
   coronary cath
   #Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic.
   - CT aorta r/o aortoenteric fistula
   - retic count in am pending
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress
   - Tx Hct <21 as no Hx CAD
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses [**Hospital1 **]
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider Cath today vs. when patient presents again for surgery

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring, and aortic valve abscess. He also has a history of profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but has developed a new wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram (TTE) and a decreased left tibial pulse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high risk of developing further endocarditis due to his history of recurrent endocarditis and the presence of aortic valve abscess.
2. Embolic Phenomena: The patient has developed embolic disease in his left foot and eye, which may lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
3. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient's aortic valve replacement ring is dehiscent, which may lead to further complications if not addressed promptly.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a new wall motion abnormality on TTE, which may indicate coronary artery disease or emboli in the coronaries.
5. Anemia: The patient has a history of profound hemolytic anemia, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may be due to pre-renal etiology, and requires close monitoring.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CHF and may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
8. Infections: The patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis and may be at risk for further infections, such as bacteremia or sepsis.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics as per ID recommendations.
2. Monitor for signs of endocarditis, embolic phenomena, and aortic valve replacement complications.
3. Consider coronary catheterization to assess for coronary artery disease.
4. Monitor for signs of anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor kidney function and adjust medications accordingly.
6. Consider stress testing to assess for cardiovascular complications.
7. Monitor for signs of infections and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
8. Consider referral to a cardiothoracic surgeon for further evaluation and management of the aortic valve replacement ring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone. He has been diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, likely due to valvular damage, and has received 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). He is currently hemodynamically stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm and blood pressure of 88/72 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has likely developed endocarditis due to the enterococcal bacteremia, which may lead to further valve damage and potential embolic events.
2. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia may worsen, leading to anemia, fatigue, and potential cardiovascular complications.
3. Aortic valve replacement ring dehiscence: The dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring may lead to further valve damage and potential cardiac complications.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CHF and new wall motion abnormality on TTE may indicate coronary artery disease, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased, and he may be at risk for acute renal failure, particularly if he has underlying kidney disease or is taking nephrotoxic medications.
6. Infectious processes: The patient has a history of dental procedures and may have an infectious process in his mouth, which may need to be addressed.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CHF and new wall motion abnormality on TTE may indicate potential cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
8. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of CHF and new wall motion abnormality on TTE may indicate potential pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient should receive a regular, low-sodium diet to help manage his hemolytic anemia and potential fluid overload.
2. Glycemic control: The patient should have his blood glucose levels monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient has a PICC line, which should be monitored for signs of infection or thrombosis.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient should receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP as indicated.
5. Monitoring: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of endocarditis, hemolytic anemia, aortic valve replacement ring dehiscence, coronary artery disease, acute renal failure, infectious processes, cardiovascular complications, and pulmonary complications.

Further evaluation and management:

1. ID consultation: The patient should have an ID consultation to further evaluate and manage his infectious processes.
2. Cardiology consultation: The patient should have a cardiology consultation to further evaluate and manage his cardiovascular complications.
3. Nephrology consultation: The patient should have a nephrology consultation to further evaluate and manage his acute renal failure.
4. Pulmonology consultation: The patient should have a pulmonology consultation to further evaluate and manage his pulmonary complications.
5. Dental consultation: The patient should have a dental consultation to further evaluate and manage his potential infectious process in his mouth.
6. Vascular consultation: The patient should have a vascular consultation to further evaluate and manage his potential vascular complications.
7. Coronary catheterization: The patient should undergo coronary catheterization to further evaluate and manage his coronary artery disease.
8. Cardiac catheterization: The patient should undergo cardiac catheterization to further evaluate and manage his potential cardiac complications."

   - Hep C: Pending
   - MRI: Read pending
   - ECHO: (Summary) Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2141-11-27**], the septum is now hypokinetic. The aortic root
   abscess/dehiscence with associated paravalvular regurgitation is now
   present.
   - CXR: (Wet Read) PICC terminates in SVC, Cardiomegaly, no acute
   cardiopulmonary process.
   - Blood/Urine cultures pending
   - MRA: No evidence of aneurysms in the major intracranial arteries.
   However, MRA is not sensitive for small mycotic aneurysms, which may
   occur more peripherally. Head MRI with and without contrast may be
   useful if intracranial infection is suspected.
   - CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Post-surgical changes with aortic graft and
   aortic valve prosthesis. 2. Ascending aorta measures up to 5.9 cm in
   diameter. 3. Cardiomegaly. 4. Small left pleural effusion. 5. Left
   basilar consolidation/atelectasis. 6. Splenomegaly. 7. Small amount of
   free fluid in the pelvis. 8. No CT evidence for aortoenteric fistula.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex (dental films) pending to assess for infectious process in
   mouth. Dental consult will be by today at 4pm.
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Increase Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue this
   coumadin for a few days and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula.
   - Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated.
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Will get MRA of left foot today
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   - Will also ask addiction about appropriate pain control
   post-operatively
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with an increase of creatinine from
   baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, on presentation here, 1.2. Today Cr
   1.0 and continues to improve. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and
   hypotensive state in OSH.
   -Will follow with BMP
   -Caution with renally cleared drugs

   [**2141-11-27**], the septum is now hypokinetic. The aortic root
   abscess/dehiscence with associated paravalvular regurgitation is now
   present.

   - Blood/Urine cultures pending
   - MRA: No evidence of aneurysms in the major intracranial arteries.
   However, MRA is not sensitive for small mycotic aneurysms, which may
   occur more peripherally. Head MRI with and without contrast may be
   useful if intracranial infection is suspected.
   - CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Post-surgical changes with aortic graft and
   aortic valve prosthesis. 2. Ascending aorta measures up to 5.9 cm in
   diameter. 3. Cardiomegaly. 4. Small left pleural effusion. 5. Left

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex (dental films) pending to assess for infectious process in
   mouth. Dental consult will be by today at 4pm.
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Increase Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue this
   coumadin for a few days and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula.
   - Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated.
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Will get MRA of left foot today
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   - Will also ask addiction about appropriate pain control
   post-operatively
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring, and right fibrous trigone abscess. He has also developed severe left tibial disease and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is receiving antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Emboli: The patient is at risk for septic emboli to the left foot and left eye due to the presence of endocarditis and aortic valve dehiscence.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement Complications: The patient's AVR is dehiscent, which may lead to further complications such as aortic regurgitation and heart failure.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has developed coronary artery disease, which may lead to acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which may worsen if not adequately treated.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may require dialysis and further complicate his condition.
6. Infectious Complications: The patient is at risk for further infectious complications such as sepsis, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
8. Pulmonary Complications: The patient is at risk for pulmonary complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Perform a MRA of the left foot to assess for septic emboli.
4. Consider CABG at the same time as AVR to address the patient's coronary artery disease.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular and pulmonary status and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Consider a SW consult for support and addiction treatment.

Note: This summary is based on the provided information and may not be a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition. A more detailed assessment would require a physical examination, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic studies."

   - Hep C: Pending
   - MRI: Read pending
   - ECHO: (Summary) Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2141-11-27**], the septum is now hypokinetic. The aortic root
   abscess/dehiscence with associated paravalvular regurgitation is now
   present.
   - CXR: (Wet Read) PICC terminates in SVC, Cardiomegaly, no acute
   cardiopulmonary process.
   - Blood/Urine cultures pending
   - MRA: No evidence of aneurysms in the major intracranial arteries.
   However, MRA is not sensitive for small mycotic aneurysms, which may
   occur more peripherally. Head MRI with and without contrast may be
   useful if intracranial infection is suspected.
   - CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Post-surgical changes with aortic graft and
   aortic valve prosthesis. 2. Ascending aorta measures up to 5.9 cm in
   diameter. 3. Cardiomegaly. 4. Small left pleural effusion. 5. Left
   basilar consolidation/atelectasis. 6. Splenomegaly. 7. Small amount of
   free fluid in the pelvis. 8. No CT evidence for aortoenteric fistula.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex (dental films) pending to assess for infectious process in
   mouth. Dental consult will be by today at 4pm.
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Increase Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue this
   coumadin for a few days and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula.
   - Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated.
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Will get MRA of left foot today
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   - Will also ask addiction about appropriate pain control
   post-operatively
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with an increase of creatinine from
   baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, on presentation here, 1.2. Today Cr
   1.0 and continues to improve. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and
   hypotensive state in OSH.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: [**Known firstname 3987**] is clinically and
   hemodynamically stable.  He is receiving dual antibiotic therapy for
   his Enterococcal endocarditis.  His Hct is drifting down,
   unsurprisingly.  We have thoroughly reviewed his CT scans, MRI, MRA,
   TTE, and transthoracic echo with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5648**], and CCU and CT surgery
   teams.  Infectious Disease team indicating that a total of two weeks
   duration of antibiotics prior to surgery mauy be optimal, with plans to
   continue antibiotics both during and after surgery.  Therefore,
   anticipated surgery will likel;y occur next week, and we will keep
   [**Known firstname 3987**] in the hospital to recive his IV antibiotics. Transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 790**]
   3 today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.

   - Hep C: Pending
   - MRI: Read pending
   - ECHO: (Summary) Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2141-11-27**], the septum is now hypokinetic. The aortic root
   abscess/dehiscence with associated paravalvular regurgitation is now
   present.
   - CXR: (Wet Read) PICC terminates in SVC, Cardiomegaly, no acute
   cardiopulmonary process.
   - Blood/Urine cultures pending
   - MRA: No evidence of aneurysms in the major intracranial arteries.
   However, MRA is not sensitive for small mycotic aneurysms, which may
   occur more peripherally. Head MRI with and without contrast may be
   useful if intracranial infection is suspected.
   - CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Post-surgical changes with aortic graft and
   aortic valve prosthesis. 2. Ascending aorta measures up to 5.9 cm in
   diameter. 3. Cardiomegaly. 4. Small left pleural effusion. 5. Left
   basilar consolidation/atelectasis. 6. Splenomegaly. 7. Small amount of
   free fluid in the pelvis. 8. No CT evidence for aortoenteric fistula.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex (dental films) pending to assess for infectious process in
   mouth. Dental consult will be by today at 4pm.
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Increase Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue this
   coumadin for a few days and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula.
   - Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated.
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Will get MRA of left foot today
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   - Will also ask addiction about appropriate pain control
   post-operatively
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with an increase of creatinine from
   baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, on presentation here, 1.2. Today Cr
   1.0 and continues to improve. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and
   hypotensive state in OSH.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: [**Known firstname 3987**] is clinically and
   hemodynamically stable.  He is receiving dual antibiotic therapy for
   his Enterococcal endocarditis.  His Hct is drifting down,
   unsurprisingly.  We have thoroughly reviewed his CT scans, MRI, MRA,
   TTE, and transthoracic echo with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5648**], and CCU and CT surgery
   teams.  Infectious Disease team indicating that a total of two weeks
   duration of antibiotics prior to surgery mauy be optimal, with plans to
   continue antibiotics both during and after surgery.  Therefore,
   anticipated surgery will likel;y occur next week, and we will keep
   [**Known firstname 3987**] in the hospital to recive his IV antibiotics. Transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 790**]
   3 today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.

   10:00 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Patient's Condition:**

* The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia, causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone.
* The patient has hemodynamically stable and is receiving dual antibiotic therapy for endocarditis.
* He has a history of anemia, likely due to hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has stabilized after transfusion.
* The patient has severe left tibial disease, which may require intervention.
* He has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and is currently on suboxone therapy.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Endocarditis:** The patient is at risk for further embolic phenomena, abscess formation, and possible valve failure.
2. **Aortic Valve Replacement:** The patient's aortic valve replacement ring is dehiscent, and the valve may need to be replaced or repaired during surgery.
3. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may worsen, and he may require further transfusions.
4. **Left Tibial Disease:** The patient's severe left tibial disease may require intervention, which may be complicated by his concurrent active infectious process.
5. **Coronary Artery Disease:** The patient's coronary arteries are clean, but he has a new wall motion abnormality on TTE, which may indicate emboli in the coronaries.
6. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and he may be at risk for further renal damage.
7. **Hepatitis C:** The patient's hepatitis C serology is pending, and he may be at risk for liver damage if he is infected.
8. **Suboxone Withdrawal:** The patient is taking suboxone therapy for opioid addiction, and he may experience withdrawal symptoms if the dose is changed or if he stops taking the medication.
9. **Pain Management:** The patient may require pain management during and after surgery, which may be complicated by his history of IVDU and opioid addiction.
10. **Surgical Complications:** The patient may be at risk for surgical complications, such as bleeding, infection, and cardiac arrhythmias, during his planned AVR and possible CABG surgery.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient will continue to receive dual antibiotic therapy for endocarditis.
* He will undergo further evaluation and management for his anemia, left tibial disease, and coronary artery disease.
* The patient will be monitored for signs of acute renal failure and hepatitis C infection.
* He will receive suboxone therapy for opioid addiction and pain management during and after surgery.
* The patient will be transferred to the CCU for further management and will be considered for transfer to the floor in the morning.
* Surgery is planned for next week, and the patient will receive IV antibiotics during his hospital stay."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye, Coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 3); given
   per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.

   cerebellum, which may be cortical or leptomeningeal. Given the clinical
   setting, they are consistent with septic emboli. 2. Interval increase
   in chronic infacts and chronic microhemorrhages, likely due to
   recurrent emboli in the setting of AVR.
   - MR Angiogram of left leg prelim read:

   PROXIMALLY OCCLUDED, RECONSTITUTES MID CALF.
   EKG: TWI V2/V3, ST depressions in V2-V6, RBBB
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.
   Essentially resolved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Septic emboli: The patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis and has developed septic emboli in the left foot, left eye, coronary artery, and possibly the cerebral hemispheres and left cerebellum.
2. Aortic valve dehiscence: The patient's aortic valve replacement ring has dehisced, leading to a possible abscess in the fibrous trigone.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has developed hemolytic anemia, likely secondary to valvular damage, which has stabilized with transfusions.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to a combination of hemolytic anemia, marrow suppression from an active inflammatory state, and possible GI bleed.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has new wall motion abnormality on TTE, concerning for emboli in the coronaries.
6. Peripheral arterial disease: The patient has severe left tibial disease and may require intervention.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient had a pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state, which has essentially resolved.
8. Hepatitis C infection: The patient's hepatitis C serology is negative, but he has a history of IVDU and is currently on suboxone.
9. Active heroin withdrawal: The patient is at risk for active heroin withdrawal, and his suboxone dose will need to be managed carefully.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of CHF and has developed new-onset MR and paravalvular aortic regurgitation.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as per ID recs.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels daily and transfuse as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider CABG at the same time as AVR.
4. Manage the patient's pain and symptoms of active heroin withdrawal.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Consider intervention for the patient's peripheral arterial disease.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and adjust therapy as needed."

   cerebellum, which may be cortical or leptomeningeal. Given the clinical
   setting, they are consistent with septic emboli. 2. Interval increase
   in chronic infacts and chronic microhemorrhages, likely due to
   recurrent emboli in the setting of AVR.
   - MR Angiogram of left leg prelim read:

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.

   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone, causing severe hemolytic anemia and enterococcal bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamically stable
* Fever controlled
* Blood pressure: 84/44 mmHg
* Heart rate: 67 bpm
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* White blood cell count: 8.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 243 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.38 ng/mL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Septic emboli: The patient has a history of endocarditis and AVR, which increases the risk of septic emboli to the brain, lungs, and other organs.
2. Aortic valve replacement: The patient's aortic valve replacement ring is dehiscent, which may lead to further complications, such as valve failure or infective endocarditis.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe hemolytic anemia, which may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's cardiac catheterization report shows clean coronaries, but there is concern for emboli in the coronaries, which may lead to acute coronary syndrome.
6. Peripheral artery disease: The patient's MRA report shows occlusive arteries in the left leg, which may lead to tissue necrosis or gangrene.
7. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of endocarditis and bacteremia, which increases the risk of further infectious complications, such as abscesses or sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin) for enterococcal bacteremia
* Monitoring for signs of septic emboli, anemia, and renal failure
* Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status
* Consideration of cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to address potential coronary artery disease
* Interventional procedures to address occlusive arteries in the left leg
* Close monitoring of the patient's platelet count and hemoglobin levels
* Regular blood draws and laboratory tests to monitor for signs of infection or organ dysfunction

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.
   Essentially resolved.
   -Will follow with morning BMP

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I have summarized the patient's health progress in the ICU and identified potential medical complications that can arise.

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 28 years old
* Chief complaint: Enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone
* Medical history: Aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2, and a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) prior to the second surgery

**Current Status:**

* Hemodynamically stable
* Clinically stable
* Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression secondary to infectious state is likely the cause of anemia
* Hct stable at 26.6%
* Left foot appears warm and well perfused, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on the left
* ABI shows severe left tibial disease
* Coronaries appear clean on cardiac catheterization, but new wall motion abnormality on TTE is concerning for emboli in the coronaries

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Endocarditis:** The patient's enterococcal bacteremia is likely the source of the endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as septic emboli, abscesses, and valve damage.
2. **Aortic Valve Replacement:** The dehiscent aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone may lead to further complications such as aortic regurgitation, valve damage, or even aortic dissection.
3. **Anemia:** The patient's hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression may worsen, leading to further anemia, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. **Left Foot Embolic Disease:** The patient's left foot appears warm and well perfused, but the ABI shows severe left tibial disease, which may lead to further complications such as gangrene, amputation, or chronic pain.
5. **Coronary Artery Disease:** The new wall motion abnormality on TTE is concerning for emboli in the coronaries, which may lead to further complications such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
6. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.8, which peaked at 1.9 in OSH, and is currently 0.9. Further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease may arise if left untreated.
7. **Septic Emboli:** The patient's enterococcal bacteremia may lead to septic emboli in various organs, including the brain, lungs, liver, or spleen, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, or even death.

**Assessment and Plan:**

1. Continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin per ID recs to treat the enterococcal bacteremia.
2. Monitor for signs of septic emboli and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat them.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary to maintain a Hct > 21%.
4. Monitor the patient's left foot and ABI to prevent further complications such as gangrene or amputation.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coronaries and consider CABG at the same time as AVR if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels and take appropriate measures to prevent further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust the plan as necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop on Sunday (last dose Saturday evening)
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs

   at this point, no intervention at this time
   - Follow pulses daily
   #CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did
   have a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall
   motion abnormality on TTE

   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - Hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border, radiating to the carotids, apex, and back, consistent with aortic regurgitation. The patient also has decreased pulses in the left foot, with severe left tibial disease on MRA.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for:

* WBC: 8.8-8.3 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 26.6-26.1%
* Plt: 243-212 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.2-0.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.38 ng/mL
* Glucose: 103-94 mg/dL
* LDH: 711 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Endocarditis: likely embolic phenomena to the left foot, left eye, coronary artery, and cerebral hemispheres, with possible abscess in the fibrous trigone
* Aortic valve replacement: dehiscent aortic valve replacement ring in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch
* Anemia: likely due to hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression secondary to infectious state
* L foot embolic disease: severe left tibial disease on MRA
* Coronaries: clean coronaries on cardiac cath, with new wall motion abnormality on TTE concerning for emboli
* Hx of IVDU: patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his second surgery

The patient's current medications include:

* Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin for enterococcal bacteremia
* Metoprolol to keep heart rate < 70 bpm
* Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin for enterococcal bacteremia
* Monitoring for signs of septic emboli and acute ischemia
* Considering CABG at the same time as AVR
* Monitoring Hct daily and transfusing <21
* Following up with vascular/interventional consultation for left foot embolic disease
* Monitoring for signs of active heroin withdrawal and adjusting suboxone dose as needed
* Continuing to monitor for signs of fluid overload and acute renal failure

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending transfer to the hospital ward."
