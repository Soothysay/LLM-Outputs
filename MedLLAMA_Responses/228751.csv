   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in setting of seizure in
   order to protect airway and in anticipation of large anticipated doses
   of sedating medications. Per report there was no respiratory distress
   prior to intubation, and no significant amount of secretions. Chest
   x-ray with small bilateral effusions and atelectasis, however has a
   history of chronic effusions and is status-post VATS in [**2182**].
   - Wean to pressure support, decrease FiO2 and follow serial ABGs, will
   hope for SBT in morning and extubation if he is requiring only minimal
   ventilator support
   - If making secretions, will send off sputum cultures
   - Albuterol/atrovent MDI's
   - Balance need for sedation for withdrawal symptoms with attempting to
   not over suppress respiratory drive
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, as
   well as intracranial hemorrhage. It is unknown when exactly his last
   drink was, and if he sustained any recent trauma, however head CT
   preliminary read was negative for any new pathology. His electrolytes
   appear to be within normal limits, however his phenytoin level is low
   at 3.6. It is unknown which, and how much, anti-seizure medications he
   was taking prior to admission. Correct dilantin level for albumin is
   4.29.
   - Will discuss with neurology benefits of reloading patient with
   dilantin. It remains unclear if he has seizures outside of alcohol
   withdrawal, but his prior bleeds may serve as a focus of irritation for
   further seizures. After discussing with neurology, will give additional
   dose of 500 mg of dilantin, then resume 250 mg [**Hospital1 7**] dosing, following up
   levels.
   - Follow up final head CT read
   - Monitor and repeat electrolytes closely (added on magnesium, calcium,
   phosphate)
   .
   #) History of alcohol withdrawal: Patient already on versed drip for
   sedation, which will also serve to help with any withdrawal.
   - IVF repletion
   - Monitor and replete electrolytes aggressively
   - Valium 10 mg Q10-15 minutes PRN CIWA >10, as load with valium will
   attempt to wean versed drip off, then plan for extubation
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Appears to be in atrial fibrillation. Improved with IVF
   and after treating withdrawal with benzodiazepams. Blood pressure is
   stable and does not appear to be in sustained RVR.
   - Continue to monitor trend on telemetry
   .
   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulitis,
   however will continue to monitor. He received a dose of vancomycin in
   the ED for possible cellulitis.
   .
   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF,
   however there are no echocardiograms in our system.
   - Monitoring BP, respiratory status closely.
   .
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Per report, patient has not been on
   anticoagulation as outpatient, and ASA was held during last admission
   in [**2184-9-22**] due to his intracranial bleeding. He is likely not a
   candidate for anticoagulation given history of multiple types of
   bleeding and falls with seizures.
   - Monitor rate, no anticoagulation given history of intracerebral bleed
   and falls
   - repleting mg
   .
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear
   if this has been followed up regularly. Not an acute issue--no mets
   noted on CT scan, however could miss these. Would consider MRI once
   withdrawal symptoms treated.
   .
   #) History of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural: Per inital report,
   no new findings on head CT.
   - Follow up final head CT [**Location (un) **], mental status once off sedation and
   extubated.
   .
   #) Anemia: Per OMR records, patient's baseline during last stay appears
   to be 28-30. His MCV is 91.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Checking folate, B12 (although has reported allergy to folic acid,
   however he was given a dose in ED), iron studies

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD, was intubated after a witnessed seizure in the emergency department. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a recent head CT showing no new pathology. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and is at risk for further seizures. He is also experiencing tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hand erythema, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizures and low phenytoin level increase the risk of seizure recurrence. Monitoring of electrolytes and consideration of reloading the patient with dilantin are necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his chronic lung disease and potential secretions. Weaning to pressure support and monitoring of serial ABGs are necessary.
3. Infection: The patient's hand erythema may be a sign of cellulitis, and monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia may be related to his underlying heart disease or medication side effects. Monitoring of cardiac status and potential adjustments to medications are necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to his chronic disease or medication side effects. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of blood transfusions may be necessary.
6. Worsening of diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic CHF may worsen due to his chronic disease and potential fluid overload. Monitoring of cardiac status and potential adjustments to medications are necessary.
7. Esophageal adenocarcinoma: The patient's history of esophageal adenocarcinoma may have implications for his treatment and follow-up care. Monitoring for signs of recurrence or metastasis is necessary.
8. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient's history of intraparenchymal hemorrhage may increase his risk of further bleeding. Monitoring of his neurologic status and potential adjustments to medications are necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve his outcomes."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in setting of seizure in
   order to protect airway and in anticipation of large anticipated doses
   of sedating medications, without any respiratory distress. CXR with
   bilateral effusions but no localized infiltrates. Given increased
   secretions now, concerning for aspiration.
   - SBT and extubation this morning after sending sputum cultures
   - Albuterol/atrovent MDI's
   - Sedation with valium, weaned of versed.
   - monitor closely for flash pulm edema insetting of reported diastolic
   CHF with removal of positive pressure.  Consider lasix prn, esp now
   that has received 2L IVF.
   .
   #) Seizure: Unclear if seizure history is purely in setting of
   withdrawal or SDH or primary epilepsy. Reports last drink day prior to
   admission, alcohol level zero. No apparent trauma, head CT prelim was
   negative.
   - s/p dilantin dose and restarted home dose (level previously low)
   - Follow up final head CT read
   - follow and replete lytes

   #) Afib: Unclear if takes BB at home. Likely worsened by stress of
   withdrawal and low magnesium.
   - No anticoagulation given h/o falls and SDH

   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulites as no
   tenderness or warmth. He received a dose of vancomycin in the ED for
   possible cellulitis.

   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF.
   - will check ECHO
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   .
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD, was intubated after a witnessed seizure in the emergency department. He has been receiving invasive ventilation, midazolam, and heparin sodium. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/77 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 277 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the presence of bilateral effusions on his chest X-ray. He is also at risk of aspiration due to increased secretions.
2. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizures and may be at risk of developing another seizure due to his withdrawal from alcohol.
3. History of alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can manifest as seizures, hallucinations, and other symptoms.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may worsen his condition and increase his risk of developing cardiac complications.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, which may worsen with the removal of positive pressure ventilation.
6. Esophageal adenocarcinoma: The patient has a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which may require further evaluation and treatment once his withdrawal symptoms are managed.
7. Hand erythema: The patient has hand erythema, which may be due to cellulitis or another cause.
8. FEN: The patient is at risk of developing food intolerance due to his history of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
9. PPx: The patient is at risk of developing peptic ulcer disease due to his history of COPD and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
10. ACCESS: The patient is at risk of developing access site complications due to his history of central venous catheter placement."

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and global
   biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   Based on [**2182**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo
   findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions
   regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
   echocardiographic data.
   Assessment and Plan
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in setting of seizure in
   order to protect airway and in anticipation of large anticipated doses
   of sedating medications, without any respiratory distress. CXR with
   bilateral effusions but no localized infiltrates. Given increased
   secretions now, concerning for aspiration.
   - SBT and extubation this morning after sending sputum cultures
   - Albuterol/atrovent MDI's
   - Sedation with valium, weaned of versed.
   - monitor closely for flash pulm edema insetting of reported diastolic
   CHF with removal of positive pressure.  Consider lasix prn, esp now
   that has received 2L IVF.
   #) Seizure: Unclear if seizure history is purely in setting of
   withdrawal or SDH or primary epilepsy. Reports last drink day prior to
   admission, alcohol level zero. No apparent trauma, head CT prelim was
   negative.
   - s/p dilantin dose and restarted home dose (level previously low)
   - Follow up final head CT read
   - follow and replete lytes
   #) History of alcohol withdrawal: On large doses of Valium per CIWA
   - IVF repletion
   - Folate (taken without reaction), MVI, thiamine
   #) Afib: Unclear if takes BB at home. Likely worsened by stress of
   withdrawal and low magnesium.
   - No anticoagulation given h/o falls and SDH
   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulites as no
   tenderness or warmth. He received a dose of vancomycin in the ED for
   possible cellulitis.
   - holding Abx for now.
   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF.
   - will check ECHO
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear
   if this has been followed up regularly. Not an acute issue--no mets
   noted on CT scan, however could miss these. Would consider MRI once
   withdrawal symptoms treated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male, is a known alcohol abuser with a history of seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD. He presented intubated in the emergency department after a witnessed seizure. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, and potential aspiration. He has a history of diastolic CHF, and his echocardiogram shows mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient's current medications include Valium, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the presence of bilateral effusions on his CXR and increased secretions. He may be at risk for aspiration, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
2. Seizure: The patient's seizure history is unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine if it is related to alcohol withdrawal, subdural hemorrhage, or primary epilepsy.
3. Aspiration: The patient's increased secretions and bilateral effusions on his CXR increase his risk for aspiration.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's history of diastolic CHF and the presence of mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on his echocardiogram suggest that he may be at risk for worsening heart failure.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and his current respiratory status increase his risk for COPD exacerbation.
6. Esophageal adenocarcinoma: The patient's history of esophageal adenocarcinoma and his current NPO status increase his risk for complications related to this condition.
7. VAP: The patient's presence in the ICU and his current respiratory status increase his risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and his current medical condition increase his risk for deep vein thrombosis.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's current medical condition and his history of alcohol abuse increase his risk for stress ulcer.
10. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and his current withdrawal symptoms increase his risk for withdrawal syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in setting of seizure in
   order to protect airway and in anticipation of large anticipated doses
   of sedating medications, without any respiratory distress. CXR with
   bilateral effusions but no localized infiltrates. Given increased
   secretions now, concerning for aspiration.
   - SBT and extubation this morning after sending sputum cultures
   - Albuterol/atrovent MDI's
   - Sedation with valium, weaned of versed.
   - monitor closely for flash pulm edema insetting of reported diastolic
   CHF with removal of positive pressure.  Consider lasix prn, esp now
   that has received 2L IVF.
   #) Seizure: Unclear if seizure history is purely in setting of
   withdrawal or SDH or primary epilepsy. Reports last drink day prior to
   admission, alcohol level zero. No apparent trauma, head CT prelim was
   negative.
   - s/p dilantin dose and restarted home dose (level previously low)
   - Follow up final head CT read
   - follow and replete lytes
   #) History of alcohol withdrawal: On large doses of Valium per CIWA
   - IVF repletion
   - Folate (taken without reaction), MVI, thiamine
   #) Afib: Unclear if takes BB at home. Likely worsened by stress of
   withdrawal and low magnesium.
   - No anticoagulation given h/o falls and SDH
   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulites as no
   tenderness or warmth. He received a dose of vancomycin in the ED for
   possible cellulitis.
   - holding Abx for now.
   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF.
   - will check ECHO
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear
   if this has been followed up regularly. Not an acute issue--no mets
   noted on CT scan, however could miss these. Would consider MRI once
   withdrawal symptoms treated.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD. He presented intubated after a witnessed seizure in the emergency department. The patient is currently receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal, including large doses of Valium, and is being monitored closely for flash pulmonary edema due to reported diastolic CHF.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm (84-133 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 154/98 mmHg (72-176/114 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (15-33 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 90%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 277 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 29 mmHg
* Glucose: 74 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* ECHO: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and global biventricular systolic function, and dilated ascending aorta.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to increased secretions and aspiration risk
* Flash pulmonary edema due to reported diastolic CHF
* Seizure recurrence due to unclear etiology and ongoing withdrawal symptoms
* Worsening of diastolic CHF due to stress of withdrawal and low magnesium
* Development of pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and increased risk of VTE
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer and increased risk of bleeding
* Infection due to compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.

Based on the patient's conditions and lab results, I recommend close monitoring for respiratory failure, seizure recurrence, and flash pulmonary edema. The patient should be treated with large doses of Valium to manage withdrawal symptoms, and anticonvulsants should be continued to prevent seizure recurrence. The patient's diastolic CHF should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to adjusting treatment to manage this condition. Additionally, the patient's risk of VTE should be assessed, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who presented intubated after a witnessed seizure in the emergency department. He has been experiencing withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, aggression, and hallucinations, and has been receiving treatment with Valium. He has also been experiencing respiratory failure, which has been resolved with extubation. He has a history of seizures, and it is unclear whether his seizure history is related to withdrawal or another underlying condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium Tremens (DTs): The patient's symptoms of agitation, aggression, and hallucinations are consistent with DTs, which are a common complication of alcohol withdrawal.
2. Seizure Recurrence: The patient's history of seizures and his current symptoms of withdrawal and hallucinations increase his risk of seizure recurrence.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and his current respiratory symptoms increase his risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of diastolic CHF and his current symptoms of hypertension and tachycardia increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Infections: The patient's history of COPD and his current symptoms of cough and shortness of breath increase his risk of infections, such as pneumonia.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of esophageal adenocarcinoma and his current symptoms of nausea and vomiting increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of seizures and his current symptoms of hallucinations and confusion increase his risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or encephalopathy.
8. Endocarditis: The patient's history of intracranial bleed and his current symptoms of fever and chills increase his risk of endocarditis.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and his current symptoms of cough and shortness of breath increase his risk of pneumonia.
10. Sepsis: The patient's history of infections and his current symptoms of fever and chills increase his risk of sepsis."
