   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and severe liver disease. She was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT, which is contraindicated for anticoagulation. The patient has a high risk of bleeding and is experiencing active bleeding with melena. She also has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, which is likely secondary to liver disease.

The patient's condition is deteriorating, with increasing ascites, portal hypertension, and splanchnic thrombosis. She has a high risk of developing sepsis, and her blood cultures are positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and is at risk for cardiac complications.

The patient's medical history includes ulcerative colitis, refractory to treatment, and a recent course of remicade and prednisone. She has a history of bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to her liver disease and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her liver disease, ascites, and positive blood cultures.
2. Bleeding: The patient has active bleeding with melena and is at risk for further bleeding due to her liver disease, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.
3. Portal hypertension: The patient has portal hypertension, which is a complication of cirrhosis and can lead to further bleeding and ascites.
4. Splanchnic thrombosis: The patient has splanchnic thrombosis, which can lead to further bleeding and ischemia.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, which can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure and stroke.
6. Liver failure: The patient has acute decompensated hepatic failure, which can lead to further liver damage and death.
7. Kidney failure: The patient has a high risk of developing kidney failure due to her liver disease and ascites.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient has a high risk of developing respiratory failure due to her liver disease and ascites.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Continue to administer antibiotics for the patient's sepsis.
3. Continue to transfuse platelets and FFP to support the patient's coagulopathy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and ascites.
5. Consider placing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to manage the patient's portal hypertension.
6. Consider performing a liver transplant to manage the patient's liver disease.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider intubation if necessary."

   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Abdominal CT: CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus,

   at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent, however.
   Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn: intra-abdominal,
   paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small bowel thickening
   (likely related to ascites and venous congestion from splanchnic
   thrombus).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn: intra-abdominal,

   thrombus).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and portal vein thrombosis. She was transferred to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT and is not a candidate for anticoagulation. The patient is experiencing bleeding from multiple sites, including the NG tube, foley catheter, and chest tube. She has a platelet count of 13 and is receiving platelet transfusions. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, and her blood pressure is stable. She has a history of severe ulcerative colitis and has been treated with steroids and remicade. She is currently receiving lactulose, rifaximin, and ursodiol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is experiencing bleeding from multiple sites, which is a significant risk factor for further bleeding and hemorrhage.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 13, which is a significant risk factor for bleeding and thrombosis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR and is at risk for further bleeding and thrombosis.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of HIT and is at risk for developing sepsis.
5. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left pneumothorax, which is a significant risk factor for further respiratory compromise.
6. Hepatic failure: The patient has acute decompensated hepatic failure, which is a significant risk factor for further liver failure and death.
7. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has severe ulcerative colitis, which is a significant risk factor for further complications, including toxic megacolon and perforation.
8. Staph bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, which is a significant risk factor for further sepsis and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and coagulation status closely and transfuse platelets and FFP as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
4. Consider treating the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider chest tube placement if necessary.
6. Consider treating the patient's ulcerative colitis with additional medications, such as azathioprine or infliximab, if necessary.
7. Consider treating the patient's staph bacteremia with antibiotics and supportive care.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider tube feeding if necessary."
124288.0,293991,2193-10-29 05:11:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * change ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * change ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and severe liver failure who was transferred to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure and anemia. She has a large left pneumothorax with concern for progression to tension pneumothorax. She also has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and active bleeding with melanotic stools. The patient has a history of HIT, which is a contraindication for anticoagulation. She has a positive blood culture for coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus and is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Platelet count: 30
* INR: 1.8
* WBC: 2.4
* Hct: 28.0
* Cr: 1.0
* TropT: 0.02
* TC02: 34
* Glucose: 141
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 18.9 / 38.0 / 1.8, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 29 / 0.02, ALT / AST: 49 / 36, Alk Phos / T Bili: 167 / 28.2, Amylase / Lipase: 153 / 23, D-dimer: 2686 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 111 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.9 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.3 g/dL, LDH: 235 IU/L, Ca++: 10.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Gen: cachetic, frail, jaundiced, and appears comfortable in no acute distress
* HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclerae icteric, and MM slightly dry
* Neck: JVD with significant respiratory variation
* CV: RRR, no m/r/g, and R EJ in place with dressing changed
* Resp: Left-sided chest tube in place with clean dressing, breath sounds bilaterally, and absent at left base
* Abd: soft, more distended today, + bowel sounds, diffuse pain on palpation, and no rebound or guarding
* Extrem: 3+ pitting edema bilaterally to knees, worse compared to prior exam
* Skin: occasional ecchymoses and spider angiomas
* Neuro: alert, oriented x2 to person and place, not oriented to time, and more confused this morning

Potential medical complications:

* Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and active bleeding with melanotic stools, which may lead to further bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
* Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Hepatic failure: The patient has acute decompensated hepatic failure, which may lead to further liver failure, encephalopathy, and death.
* Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left pneumothorax, which may lead to tension pneumothorax and respiratory failure.
* Thrombosis: The patient has a history of HIT, which may lead to further thrombosis and bleeding.
* Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and may be at risk for sepsis and organ failure.

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
* Continue to treat the patient's bleeding with platelet transfusions and FFP.
* Continue to treat the patient's infection with vancomycin.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hepatic function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's pneumothorax and consider chest tube removal if necessary.
* Consider TIPS if the patient's hepatic function improves.
* Continue to monitor the patient's thrombosis and consider anticoagulation if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and consider antibiotics if necessary."
124288.0,293991,2193-10-29 05:11:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and severe liver disease. She was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. The patient has a history of HIT and is not a candidate for anticoagulation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has a pneumothorax with a chest tube in place, and her oxygen saturation is 94%.
* Cardiovascular: She has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and her blood pressure is stable.
* Gastrointestinal: She has severe ulcerative colitis with refractory disease, and she is bleeding from the rectum.
* Hematological: She has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 30, and she is at risk for bleeding.
* Hepatic: She has acute decompensated hepatic failure with a bilirubin level of 143 mg/dL and an INR of 1.8.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 2.4
* Hct: 28.0
* Plt: 40
* Cr: 1.0
* TropT: 0.02
* TC02: 34

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, pancytopenia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient's 24-hour events include bloody output from the nasogastric (NG) tube and urine, despite stable hemoglobin levels. She was seen by a hematologist who suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and recommended transfusions. The patient received cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen levels of 111 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin, no acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Crackles in both lung bases, diminished breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender
* Extremities: 3+ edema in both legs
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to name only

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 31 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 2.3 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 143 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Liver function tests: Abnormal
* Coagulation studies: PT/PTT/INR: 16.7/32.9/1.5
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* D-dimer: 2686 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 111 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Coagulopathy: Likely has component of DIC along with liver disease
* GIB: Bloody stools, likely due to liver disease
* Atrial fibrillation (AF): Currently in sinus rhythm
* Primary biliary cirrhosis: Observe for variceal bleeding
* MRSA bacteremia: Given the presence of MRSA in the pleural fluid, this looks less likely to be just a line infection
* Pancytopenia: On neupogen, likely due to 6-MP and Remicade, which are on hold
* Liver function abnormalities: Abnormal liver function tests, likely due to primary biliary cirrhosis
* Pain control: Acute and chronic pain, potentially due to GIB and liver disease
* Impaired skin integrity: Potential risk of skin breakdown due to immobility and pressure
* Hospital-acquired conditions: Potential risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)

The patient's plan includes:

* Supportive care with transfusions of platelets, fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, and cryoprecipitate as needed
* Transfusion of platelets given GIB and low platelet count
* Observation for variceal bleeding
* Check echo today to examine valves
* Hold 6-MP and Remicade
* Continue CT to suction
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Consider early mobility and physical therapy to prevent skin breakdown and improve overall function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   pancytopenia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient with blood from NG tube and blood from urine.  However Hct
   remained stable.  Seen by heme who felt that she probably had component
   of DIC, and gave recommendations for transfusion.    Got cryo for
   fibrinogen of 111.  Had AF with increased HR overnight then reverted to
   sinus rhythm.  MS poor this morning.  Is somewhat somnolent with

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) admitted with MRSA bacteremia, pancytopenia, and coagulopathy. She has a history of liver disease and is at risk for variceal bleeding. The patient is currently experiencing acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities, and impaired skin integrity. She is receiving supportive care, including transfusions of platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate, as well as antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia. The patient is also receiving pain management and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient's liver disease and portal hypertension increase her risk for variceal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia and coagulopathy increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can exacerbate her underlying liver disease.
3. Sepsis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and pancytopenia increase her risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy and pancytopenia increase her risk for bleeding, which can exacerbate her underlying liver disease and other medical conditions.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver disease and portal hypertension increase her risk for liver failure, which can lead to death if not managed promptly.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury increases her risk for chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's impaired skin integrity and respiratory support increase her risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to death if not managed promptly.
8. Infection: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and pancytopenia increase her risk for secondary infections, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue supportive care, including transfusions of platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate, as well as antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function and coagulation status closely to prevent variceal bleeding and other complications.
3. Consider endoscopy to evaluate the patient's esophagus and stomach for signs of bleeding or varices.
4. Consider liver transplantation if the patient's liver disease is severe and not responding to medical management.
5. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely to prevent chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge). Should consider placing
   larger bore IV for resuscitation before acute decompensation occurs.
   .
   #Code status: presumed Full Code. Should discuss with family in light
   of current health issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs

   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She was transferred to the ICU with a large left pneumothorax and concern for progression to tension pneumothorax. She has been treated with lactulose, rifaxamin, and ursodiol, and has been given platelets, PRBCs, and FFP to address thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. She has also been treated with vancomycin for a positive blood culture and has been placed on a chest tube for a pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is severely compromised, and she is at risk for further decompensation and potential death.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and is at risk for developing sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for further bleeding and potential complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation factors are abnormal, and she is at risk for further bleeding and potential complications.
5. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large pneumothorax, and she is at risk for further complications, including tension pneumothorax and potential death.
6. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has severe and refractory ulcerative colitis, and she is at risk for further complications, including toxic megacolon and potential death.
7. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient has atrial fibrillation/flutter, which could worsen her condition and increase her risk of complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and coagulation status closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Consider transfusing platelets and FFP to address thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's pneumothorax and consider further interventions, such as chest tube drainage and potential surgical intervention.
5. Continue to treat the patient's ulcerative colitis with medications and supportive care.
6. Consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist and transplant surgeon for further evaluation and management.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter and consider further interventions, such as rate control medications and cardioversion."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Received platelets & 2 units PRBCs
   - PM vanc dose held
   - Episode of respiratory distress in evening. Refused chest xray. Given
   Lasix 40 mg IV with good response, came off non-rebreather, later
   received 250 cc NS bolus for tachycardia
   - After afternoon family visit patient decided to refuse further
   medical treatment and wanted to die.  She was A&O x3. Discussed with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6688**] who also discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6379**] and transplant surgeon
   who all felt poor prognosis.  Husband called --> he and family came in
   --> family mtg and patient eventually made DNR/DNI.
   - pt. refused platelet transfusion in PM, husband honoring that request

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She was transferred to the ICU with a large left pneumothorax and concern for tension pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT, and anticoagulation is contraindicated. She has developed acute bleeding, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Her platelet count is critically low, and she has been given platelet transfusions and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to treat her bleeding. She has also developed atrial fibrillation and flutter, and her heart rate has been controlled with IV fluids. She has been given antibiotics for suspected sepsis and has had a chest tube placed for the pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is critically low, and she has been given platelet transfusions and FFP to treat her bleeding. However, her bleeding has not been controlled, and she may continue to bleed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, and her blood cultures are positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. She may develop further complications, such as organ failure, and may require further antibiotics and supportive care.
3. DIC: The patient has developed DIC, which is a life-threatening condition that can cause bleeding, organ failure, and death.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left pneumothorax, which may continue to expand and cause respiratory compromise.
5. Atrial fibrillation and flutter: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation and flutter, which may continue to cause tachycardia and may require further treatment with rate-controlling agents.
6. Liver failure: The patient has acute decompensated hepatic failure, which may continue to worsen and cause further complications.
7. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has severe and refractory ulcerative colitis, which may continue to cause bleeding, abdominal pain, and other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage her bleeding, sepsis, DIC, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and MRSA sepsis. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, which responded to furosemide (Lasix) treatment. She developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and was given a 250cc normal saline bolus, which improved her condition. The patient refused platelets and a chest X-ray (CXR) yesterday. She has a history of allergies to Demerol, morphine, and heparin agents.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm
* Blood pressure: 131/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: sinus tachycardia

Physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: no acute distress
* Eyes and conjunctiva: icteric
* Cardiovascular: normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Respiratory: crackles in both lungs, diminished breath sounds at the bases
* Abdomen: non-tender, distended
* Extremities: 3+ edema in both legs
* Skin: warm, jaundiced
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to name and place

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 0.7-0.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.9-32.6%
* Platelet count: 14-36 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* TCO2: 34 mmHg
* Glucose: 143-161 mg/dL
* Other lab results: elevated liver enzymes, lipase, and D-dimer

Assessment and Plan:

* Atrial fibrillation: continue low-dose beta blocker
* Respiratory distress: check CXR, try to diurese
* MRSA sepsis: continue vancomycin
* Cirrhosis: bili has stabilized at 30
* Coagulopathy: low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), continue to replete platelets
* ICU care: nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including coagulopathy and liver dysfunction
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to cirrhosis and coagulopathy
* Infection-related complications, including pneumonia and septicemia
* Nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate nutrition and glycemic control
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction
* Potential for further deterioration of liver function and coagulopathy due to ongoing sepsis and cirrhosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]) [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   d/c at some point but not currently.
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month (only) 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]. [**Month (only) 60**] consider d/c at some point but
   not currently.
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS. D/C ISS and finger sticks to check
   blood glucose b/c have been normal (and patient is [**Month/Day (4) 617**]).
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge). Not to replace if fall
   out.
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no
   blood products to be given.
   .
   #Disposition: to floor for hospice/[**Month/Day (4) 617**] treatment.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and portal vein thrombosis, is critically ill in the ICU. She has been experiencing acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and large left pneumothorax. The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone several procedures, including chest tube placement and platelet transfusions. Due to her poor prognosis and the family's decision to make her DNR/DNI, no further blood products or invasive procedures will be performed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and coma.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumothorax and respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and positive blood cultures may lead to further infection and sepsis.
6. Liver Failure: The patient's liver disease may lead to liver failure, which can cause further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and flutter may lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status may lead to further malnutrition and decreased immune function.
9. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's infection may lead to further complications, including abscesses, pneumonia, and septic shock.
10. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may lead to further complications, including hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrest.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and her prognosis is poor. The family has decided to make her DNR/DNI, and no further blood products or invasive procedures will be performed. The patient's care will focus on symptom management, including pain and symptom control, and comfort care. The patient will be continued on antibiotics and other medications as needed, and her condition will be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure, was transferred to the ICU due to a large left pneumothorax and concern for progression to tension pneumothorax. She was found to have portal vein thrombosis and bowel wall thickening on ultrasound. The patient has a history of refractory ascites and is not a candidate for anticoagulation.

The patient has been experiencing worsening mental status, and a family meeting was held to discuss her care. It was decided to make her DNR/DNI, and no further blood products or invasive procedures will be performed.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 13) with schistocytes and dysmorphic RBCs on peripheral smear
* Elevated INR (1.6) and DIC labs
* Positive blood cultures for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (SA)
* Elevated WBC count (0.9) after receiving Neupogen
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, and T Bili)
* Elevated lactate levels (1.9 mmol/L)

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Acute hepatic decompensation with portal vein thrombosis
* Severe ulcerative colitis with refractory ascites
* Thrombocytopenia with DIC
* Staphylococcal bacteremia
* Pneumothorax with possible tension pneumothorax
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter
* Ulcerative colitis with severe/refractory disease

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for Staphylococcal bacteremia (Vanc)
* Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
* Paracentesis and treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)
* Hematology consultation for thrombocytopenia and DIC
* Gastroenterology and transplant surgery consultations
* Chest tube placement for pneumothorax
* IVF for tachycardia
* Stress dose hydrocortisone for ulcerative colitis
* Hold on remicade and 6MP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progression of liver failure and portal hypertension
* Development of sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Hemorrhage from coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Infection and sepsis from bacteremia
* Respiratory failure from pneumothorax and underlying lung disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure from atrial fibrillation/flutter
* Gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcerative colitis and portal hypertension
* Nutritional deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances from inadequate nutrition and fluid management"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge).
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She was transferred to the ICU with a large left pneumothorax, which was treated with chest tube placement. She has a history of HIT, and anticoagulation is contraindicated due to her severe LGIB. She has developed thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and sepsis, and is being treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Her mental status is deteriorating, and she has been made DNR/DNI. She has been given lactulose to treat hepatic encephalopathy, and is being treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive liver failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and she may continue to develop complications such as encephalopathy, bleeding, and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, which may progress to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, which may increase the risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications.
5. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large pneumothorax, which may progress to tension pneumothorax if not treated promptly.
6. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation/flutter, which may increase the risk of thrombotic complications.
7. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has severe/refractory ulcerative colitis, which may lead to complications such as bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
8. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: The patient has developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which may progress to sepsis and death if not treated promptly and effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulation profile and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to treat the patient's pneumothorax with chest tube placement and suction.
6. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to treat the patient's ulcerative colitis with stress dose hydrocortisone and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation. The patient has been experiencing ineffective coping, acute pain, chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, and hospital-acquired conditions, including line infection and barotrauma.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefipime, and rifampin, as well as other medications such as pantoprazole and morphine. The patient has also been receiving fluid therapy and has been monitored for respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's line infection and liver function abnormalities increase the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function abnormalities increase the risk of liver failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and liver function abnormalities increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's line infection and liver function abnormalities increase the risk of developing other infections.
7. Kidney failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and liver function abnormalities increase the risk of kidney failure.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including ulcerative colitis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and cirrhosis, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with MRSA sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/77 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, as well as coagulopathy, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Her platelet count is low, and her white blood cell count is decreased.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently having ongoing bleeding. She has been treated with vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and has been placed on lactulose to manage her diarrhea.

The patient's medical plan includes continued vancomycin for 14 days, as well as management of her GIB with transfusions and supportive care. She is also being treated for stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued GIB, which may lead to further bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
3. Liver dysfunction, which may lead to further decompensation and potential complications such as encephalopathy or ascites.
4. MRSA bacteremia, which may lead to further sepsis and potential complications such as septic shock or organ failure.
5. Gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction, which may lead to further complications such as peritonitis or bowel ischemia.
6. Pulmonary complications, such as ARDS or pneumonia, which may arise from the patient's respiratory support and potential aspiration of gastric contents.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications and improve her outcomes."
