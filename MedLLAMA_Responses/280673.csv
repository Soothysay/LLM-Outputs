   100% RCA and w/ cardiogenic shock requiring IABP.
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2136-11-3**] 09:30 AM:  The left atrium is
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
   wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.

   hypokinesis. The inferior wall is nearly akinetic. Mild mitral and
   aortic regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and cardiogenic shock requiring IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) support. He has a 90% blockage in the left main coronary artery and 100% blockage in the right coronary artery. The patient has been stabilized and is currently on various medications, including heparin, aspirin, and clopidogrel.

The patient's echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, and the inferior wall is nearly akinetic. The patient has mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac damage. His creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. His albumin level is decreased, and his AST and LDH levels are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock requires ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent further cardiac deterioration.
2. Heart failure: The patient's left ventricular dysfunction and hypokinesis increase the risk of heart failure.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated AST and LDH levels suggest liver dysfunction, which may be related to cardiac ischemia or other factors.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's high risk of thrombus formation with an akinetic wall requires close monitoring and treatment with anticoagulants.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and potential liver dysfunction increase the risk of infection.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's decreased albumin level and potential malnutrition may increase the risk of complications and worsen outcomes.
8. Dementia: The patient's mild dementia may affect his ability to follow medical instructions and increase the risk of complications.
9. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer requires ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
10. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's immobility and potential deep vein thrombosis increase the risk of pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with a STEMI from OSH, found to have 90% L-main and 100% RCA blockages, and was in cardiogenic shock requiring IABP. He was treated with stenting to the L-main and was deemed a non-operable candidate. The patient has been weaned off IABP and is tolerating well. His current medications include Captopril, Statin, Heparin, and Aspirin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or cardiac tamponade.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure (ACRF): The patient's elevated BNP and decreased albumin levels may indicate ACRF, which can lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated AST and decreased albumin levels may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which can lead to further complications such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy.
4. Peripheral artery disease (PAD): The patient's diminished peripheral pulses and decreased ankle-brachial index (ABI) may indicate PAD, which can lead to further complications such as gangrene or amputation.
5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's inability to move due to IABP may lead to sacral decubitus ulcer, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis or osteomyelitis.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to cardiogenic shock, pneumonia, or other respiratory complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's mild dementia and decreased cardiac output may lead to further neurological complications such as stroke or encephalopathy.
8. Infection: The patient's recent completion of antibiotic therapy for PNA and his mild leukocytosis may indicate a risk of infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor his cardiac function, respiratory status, and neurological status. The patient's medications should be adjusted accordingly, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent further complications."
