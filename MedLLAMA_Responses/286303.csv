You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's current condition is stable, with no repeat episodes of VT within the past 12 hours while on Amiodarone and lidocaine drips. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 89/49 mmHg, and SpO2 of 97%.

The patient has a history of PAF and has been off warfarin pending a possible procedure. He has chronic venous stasis bilaterally and minimal ankle edema. His laboratory results show normal kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. His liver function tests are also normal, with a bilirubin level of 0.7 mg/dL and an AST level of 41 U/L.

The patient's medications include Amiodarone, lidocaine, heparin, carvedilol, spironolactone, and beta-blocker. He is also taking medications for his type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic back pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. VT recurrence: Despite being on Amiodarone and lidocaine drips, the patient is still at risk for VT recurrence.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure and LV dysfunction put him at risk for CHF exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL indicates kidney dysfunction, which can worsen if not managed properly.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his chronic venous stasis and immobility.
5. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and central lines put him at risk for infection, including VAP and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen closely to prevent these potential complications from arising."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of unknown allergy to penicillins. They are currently receiving infusions of amiodarone, lidocaine, and heparin sodium. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 89/49 mmHg. They are on mechanical ventilation with a SpO2 of 97% and are receiving IV fluids. Their laboratory results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and elevated creatinine levels. They have a history of DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is within normal limits, but their respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate kidney damage, and their white blood cell count is within normal limits, which may indicate a mild inflammatory response.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin sodium, which is an anticoagulant, and their laboratory results show an elevated PTT, which may indicate bleeding complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 136 K/uL, which is slightly low, which may indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which may indicate hyperglycemia, and their laboratory results show a normal Hct, which may indicate a lack of red blood cell production.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a history of stress ulcer prophylaxis, which may indicate a risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, which may indicate an infection, and their SpO2 is within normal limits, which may indicate a lack of respiratory distress.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust their treatment plan as necessary.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen based on the results of their laboratory tests.
3. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust their anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's nutrition plan based on their laboratory results and clinical status.
5. Consider performing additional diagnostic tests to rule out infection and other potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 yo M with a history of chronic systolic CHF, LV
   dysfuntion, s/p BiV ICD placment in [**2108**], and h/o VT treated with
   multiple therapies, most recently mexilitine/dofetilide who presents
   with VT refractory to mexilitine therapy now transferred to CCU for
   episodes of VT/VF.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient transitioned to amiodarone tonight for V tach but
   continues to have rhythm abnormalities. Since transfer to CCU patient
   has already had 2 episodes of VTach > 10 beats. Patient also has
   history of PAF and has been off of warfarin pending possible procedure.
   Since episodes of Vtach seem to be predominantly at night, I question
   whether hypoxia [**1-21**] OSA might be contributing.
   - Continue to hold Dofetilide and Mixeletene as washes out
   - Stat lytes and replete K to 4.5 and Mg to 2.2
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Start Lidocaine gtt with bolus 100mg x1
   - Make NPO in case of possible ablation
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation given possible procedure
   - Continue betablocker for rate control
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, however many risk factors including DM2,
   HTN, HL. R + L heart cath [**5-1**] shows no flow limiting disease.
   - Continue betablocker, statin
   .
   # PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure with EF 20%, s/p BiV ICD
   placement. Repeat TTE on this admission shows unchagned EF 20-25%
   dilated, LV with severe global hypokinesis. Mild signs of fluid
   overload on exam, including ankle edema and elevated JVD. Cath revealed
   elevated markedly elevated right (RA = 14 mm Hg) and left heart (PCWP =

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, LV dysfunction, and a BiV ICD placement. He presents with VT refractory to mexilitine therapy and has been transferred to the CCU for episodes of VT/VF. The patient has a history of PAF and has been off warfarin pending a possible procedure. He has also been experiencing rhythm abnormalities, including Vtach, and has been treated with amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient has a history of DM2, HTN, and HL, and has undergone a heart catheterization that showed no flow-limiting disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF): The patient's VT/VF episodes may worsen and lead to cardiac arrest, which is a life-threatening condition.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are within normal range, but the possibility of hypoxia cannot be ruled out, especially considering his history of PAF and OSA.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the possibility of respiratory failure cannot be ruled out, especially if his VT/VF episodes worsen.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and his renal function is compromised. Further deterioration of his renal function may lead to end-stage renal disease.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has a history of DM2. The possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis cannot be ruled out, especially if his blood glucose levels continue to rise.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, especially considering his compromised immune system and the presence of central lines and drains.
7. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding, especially considering his anticoagulant therapy and the presence of central lines and drains.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's VT/VF episodes may worsen and lead to cardiac arrest, which is a life-threatening condition.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 yo M with a history of chronic systolic CHF, LV
   dysfuntion, s/p BiV ICD placment in [**2108**], and h/o VT treated with
   multiple therapies, most recently mexilitine/dofetilide who presents
   with VT refractory to mexilitine therapy now transferred to CCU for
   episodes of VT/VF.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient transitioned to amiodarone tonight for V tach but
   continues to have rhythm abnormalities. Since transfer to CCU patient
   has already had 2 episodes of VTach > 10 beats. Patient also has
   history of PAF and has been off of warfarin pending possible procedure.
   Since episodes of Vtach seem to be predominantly at night, I question
   whether hypoxia [**1-21**] OSA might be contributing.
   - Continue to hold Dofetilide and Mixeletene as washes out
   - Stat lytes and replete K to 4.5 and Mg to 2.2
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Start Lidocaine gtt with bolus 100mg x1
   - Make NPO in case of possible ablation
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation given possible procedure
   - Continue betablocker for rate control
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, however many risk factors including DM2,
   HTN, HL. R + L heart cath [**5-1**] shows no flow limiting disease.
   - Continue betablocker, statin
   .
   # PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure with EF 20%, s/p BiV ICD
   placement. Repeat TTE on this admission shows unchagned EF 20-25%
   dilated, LV with severe global hypokinesis. Mild signs of fluid
   overload on exam, including ankle edema and elevated JVD. Cath revealed
   elevated markedly elevated right (RA = 14 mm Hg) and left heart (PCWP =
   26mmHg) filling pressures consistent with CHF.
   -continue lasix 80 mg IV x1. Goal I/O negative 1 L.
   -will reassess whether metolazone should be restarted
   -continue Carvedilol 12.5mg daily, Spironolactone 25mg daily
   .
   # Renal failure: Cr up to 1.8. Apparent baseline 1.5 to 1.7. Likely due
   to DM and HTN. Also rising in the setting of diuresis.
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Urine lytes
   - Renally dose medications
   .
   # Chronic back pain: Pain well controlled. Continue tramadol and
   lidoderm patch per outpatient regimen.
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes: Continue lantus 12 units daily and SSI.
   -qid fingersticks
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Zocor
   .
   FEN: NPO for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, LV dysfunction, and s/p BiV ICD placement. He presents with VT refractory to mexilitine therapy, now transferred to the CCU for episodes of VT/VF.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.5°C, Tcurrent 36.2°C, HR 75 bpm, BP 89/49 mmHg, RR 24 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) at clavicle, pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) not available.
* Fluid balance: Total input 2,192 mL, total output 1,307 mL, with a balance of -118 mL.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device not used, SpO2 97%.
* Physical examination: Patient is awake and oriented, with a supple neck, distant heart sounds, and normal lung sounds. He has chronic venous stasis and minimal ankle edema bilaterally.
* Laboratory results: WBC 7.4 K/uL, Hct 35.7%, Plt 136 K/uL, Cr 1.8 mg/dL, Glucose 148 mg/dL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pre-renal azotemia: Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of hypotension, there is a risk of pre-renal azotemia.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT/VF and the presence of rhythm abnormalities on admission increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure and the presence of elevated filling pressures on echocardiogram increase the risk of heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and the presence of diuresis increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and the presence of hypoglycemic medication increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
6. DVT: The patient's history of chronic venous stasis and the presence of heparin infusion increase the risk of DVT.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic lung disease and the presence of respiratory support increase the risk of pneumonia.
8. Sepsis: The patient's history of chronic illness and the presence of invasive lines increase the risk of sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic parameters closely.
* Continue to manage the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Consider adding prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia (VTach) and hyponatremia. The patient has been started on amiodarone 400mg PO BID, Lasix 40mg IV BID, and other medications for pain control, dementia, and heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/76 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia (28 mEq/L), hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L), and an elevated troponin level (1.9 ng/mL). The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VTach and the use of amiodarone may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may lead to seizures, coma, or even death if not treated promptly.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient's history of dementia and chronic pain may increase the risk of infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of chronic pain and dementia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medication as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medication as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
4. Consider ordering additional laboratory tests to rule out infection or other underlying conditions.
5. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or nephrologist for further management.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
7. Consider ordering a gastrointestinal bleeding workup if the patient's pain is not well-controlled."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, LV dysfunction, and s/p BiV ICD placement. He was admitted to the CCU on [**2115-5-3**] with refractory VT treated with multiple therapies, including mexilitine and dofetilide. The patient has been started on amiodarone and lidocaine drips, and his rhythm has been stable for the past 12 hours. He has a history of PAF and has been off warfarin pending a possible procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/76 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. His cardiac examination reveals distant heart sounds, and his lung examination is clear.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.4
* Hct: 35.7
* Plt: 136
* Cr: 1.9
* Glucose: 148
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.2/65.8/1.2, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 92/76 mmHg, which is slightly low. This may be due to his chronic systolic heart failure and LV dysfunction.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 137 mmol/L, which is low. This may be due to his chronic heart failure and LV dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. This may be due to his chronic DM and HTN.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is 3.7 mmol/L, which is low. This may be due to his chronic heart failure and LV dysfunction.
5. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is 2.2 mg/dL, which is low. This may be due to his chronic heart failure and LV dysfunction.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 148 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. This may be due to his chronic DM.
7. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is 35.7%, which is slightly low. This may be due to his chronic heart failure and LV dysfunction.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 136, which is slightly low. This may be due to his chronic heart failure and LV dysfunction.

Based on the patient's history and laboratory results, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Replete the patient's electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and sodium.
3. Continue the patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin.
4. Continue the patient's beta-blocker and statin therapy.
5. Consider adding an ACE inhibitor to the patient's medication regimen.
6. Continue the patient's diabetic diet and medication regimen.
7. Consider adding an aspirin to the patient's medication regimen.
8. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
9. Consider adding a diuretic to the patient's medication regimen to help manage his heart failure.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication regimen as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with chronic systolic heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) treated with multiple therapies. He was admitted to the ICU with VT refractory to mexilitine therapy and is currently being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine drips. He has had several episodes of VT over the past 24 hours, but none greater than 15 beats. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination is notable for distant heart sounds, bilateral ankle edema, and chronic venous stasis.

The patient has a history of chronic back pain, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic systolic heart failure. He is currently being treated with various medications, including amiodarone, lidocaine, and carvedilol, and is scheduled for an ablation procedure in the next 1-2 days.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT episodes could worsen and potentially lead to ventricular fibrillation, which could be life-threatening.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, and further reductions could lead to hypoperfusion of vital organs.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's ankle edema and elevated jugular venous distension suggest fluid overload, which could worsen his heart failure and increase his risk of complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but further increases could indicate worsening renal function, which could be a sign of prerenal failure or acute kidney injury.
5. Infection: The patient's history of chronic back pain and recent hospitalization increase his risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications, including heparin and warfarin, increases his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and medications could lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which could worsen his heart failure and increase his risk of complications.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current treatment regimen pose several potential complications that require close monitoring and management to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, LV dysfunction, and s/p BiV ICD placement. He was admitted to the CCU with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) despite therapy with mexilitine and dofetilide. He continues to experience VT episodes, but none have been greater than 15 beats. His medications include amiodarone, lidocaine, and carvedilol, which has been reduced due to low blood pressure. He also has a history of chronic back pain, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

Physical Examination:

* Vital signs: T = 36.9°C, HR = 75 bpm, BP = 86/54 mmHg, RR = 20 breaths/min, SpO2 = 94%
* Height: 68 inches
* Weight: Not recorded
* Blood pressure: 86/54 mmHg
* Heart rhythm: AV paced
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths/min

Lab Results:

* WBC: 7.4-4.9 x10^9/L
* Hct: 35.7-34.0%
* Plt: 136-153 x10^9/L
* Cr: 1.8-1.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 148-214 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.2/65.8/1.2, Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary concerns are:

1. Nausea and vomiting
2. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic
3. Pain control (acute and chronic pain)
4. Ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT)

The plan is to:

* Continue amiodarone and lidocaine therapy
* Restart mexilitene and discontinue lidocaine drip
* Replete electrolytes to K 4.5 and Mg 2.2
* Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
* Start coumadin post-procedure
* Decrease carvedilol to 6.25 mg po BID
* Plan for ablation procedure in 1-2 days
* Continue betablocker and statin therapy
* Start ASA 81 mg po for primary prevention post-procedure

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and further reductions in blood pressure may exacerbate this condition.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but further decreases in blood pressure or inadequate fluid management may worsen renal function.
3. Heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT episodes may continue or worsen if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and chronic conditions make him susceptible to infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and history of bleeding may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, and further decreases may occur with continued anticoagulation therapy.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, and further increases may occur with continued anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
