   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dilated
   cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely [**1-25**] CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 Initially thought to be [**1-25**] PE, now thought to
   be [**1-25**] CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue supplemental O2 with BiPAP.
   - Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses.  Expect improved hypoxia
   with continued diuresis.
   - Empiric abx therapy for ?PNA with azithromycin.
   - Send induced sputum cx.
   - Restart heparin gtt for ostensible treatment of acute vs. chronic PE
   pending LE DVT, final read of CTA.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient had a coronary cath in [**2170**] which showed no
   evidence of CAD.  The patient has multiple risk factors including
   hypertension, hyperlipidema, and tobacco abuse.  EKG does not show
   evidence of acute ischemia.  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - EKG daily
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, likely
   associated to alcohol abuse, with previously documented NYHA class I
   symptoms.  On echo today, the patient has decreased systolic function
   with EF documented 25-30% with no new wall motion abnormalities.  It is
   possible that the patient is experiencing volume overload causing
   symptoms of respiratory distress.  Will continue diuresis with IV
   lasix.
   - Restarted home [**Last Name (un) 239**] at lower dose (valsartan 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Will restart
   metoprolol.
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Goal diuresis approx. 2 to 2.5 L.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Restart B-blocker
   .
   # Alcohol Abuse:  CIWA PRN with ativan.  Replete magnesium PRN.
   .
   # EtOH Cirrhosis:  LFTs on arrival.  Will avoid hepatotoxic
   medications.
   .
   # Chronic Kidney disease:  Crn 1.1 on arrival.  Following contrast
   load, will monitor Crn closely.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Valsartan and metoprolol have been started and will be
   uptitrated as tolerated.
   .
# Hyperlipidemia: On [**2179-8-5**], his total cholesterol was 143, HDL 71, LDL 56.  C

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy, admitted to the ICU for marked hypoxia, likely CHF exacerbation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 114/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Spontaneous ventilation: 670 mL
* Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 8 cmH2O
* Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2): 40%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Mildly anxious and on BiPap mask
* RRR (regular rate and rhythm) with limited exam due to BiPap
* Bronchial breath sounds throughout with rales bilaterally, more prominent on the right side
* Absent breath sounds at the bases bilaterally
* Mildly warm, faint distal pulses palpable bilaterally

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 26.0%
* Platelet count (Plt): 352 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* TCO2: 17 mmHg
* Glucose: 130 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 15.8/78.8/1.4, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 114/5/<0.01, ALT/AST: 15/32, Alk Phos/T Bili: 136/0.5, D-dimer: 2829 ng/mL, LDH: 281 IU/L, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine level on arrival was 1.1 mg/dL. He has also been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, but his respiratory rate is 20 bpm, which may indicate respiratory distress.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm, but his cardiac enzymes are elevated, which may indicate cardiac damage.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which may indicate kidney damage.
* Septic shock: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for septic shock.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's CTA was negative, but he is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to his history of deep vein thrombosis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue supplemental oxygen with BiPAP
* Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses
* Empiric antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia
* Send induced sputum culture
* Restart heparin gtt for ostensible treatment of acute vs. chronic PE pending LE DVT, final read of CTA
* Continue aspirin and statin
* EKG daily
* Restart home medication, including valsartan and metoprolol
* Monitor I/Os and daily weights
* Goal diuresis: 2-2.5 L."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dilated
   cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely [**1-25**] CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 Initially thought to be [**1-25**] PE, now thought to
   be [**1-25**] CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue supplemental O2 with BiPAP.
   - Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses.  Expect improved hypoxia
   with continued diuresis.
   - Hold on further antibiotics at this point, will culture if spikes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient had a coronary cath in [**2170**] which showed no
   evidence of CAD.  The patient has multiple risk factors including
   hypertension, hyperlipidema, and tobacco abuse.  EKG does not show
   evidence of acute ischemia.  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - EKG daily
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, likely
   associated to alcohol abuse, with previously documented NYHA class I
   symptoms.  On echo today, the patient has decreased systolic function
   with EF documented 25-30% with no new wall motion abnormalities.  It is
   possible that the patient is experiencing volume overload causing
   symptoms of respiratory distress.  Will continue diuresis with IV
   lasix.
   - Restarted home [**Last Name (un) 239**] at lower dose (valsartan 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Will restart
   metoprolol (home med) if adequate diuresis continues.
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold metoprolol for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress, initially suspected to be a pulmonary embolism (PE), but now thought to be a cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CHF) exacerbation. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and alcohol abuse. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/65 mmHg. He is receiving supplemental oxygen with a BiPAP mask and diuresis with IV lasix boluses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and CHF exacerbation increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac tamponade.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease and contrast-induced nephropathy may increase the risk of renal failure.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's history of etoh cirrhosis and potential hepatotoxic medications may increase the risk of hepatic failure.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory distress and indwelling lines increase the risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and potential bleeding complications from catheterization or other invasive procedures increases the risk of bleeding.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and potential medications that affect glucose metabolism may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential malnutrition may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
9. DVT and PE: The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
10. Medication interactions: The patient's use of multiple medications may increase the risk of medication interactions and adverse effects."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-23**]:
   - Started Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **], Azithromycin for atypical
   coverage.
   - Urine legionella and flu were negative
   - All cultures, HIV, and minibal are pending
   - LE US - initial read no DVT, will restart heparin with final read
   - off BIPAP([**7-31**]), tolerating nc well on 6L
   - continue diuresis -1.6 L at 4pm, 5pm lytes checked, given additional
   dose of lasix, checking [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   - CTA - final: No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection. Diffuse
   central perihilar ground-glass opacification, bilateral pleural
   effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery
   hypertension is most consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   Differential diagnosis, however, does include interstitial pneumonia
   such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] well as pulmonary hemorrhage, drug hypersensitivity,
   sarcoid and alveolar proteinosis although these seem less likely.
   Recommend rescan after treatment to ensure no underlying process.
   Vascular including dense coronary artery calcifications.  Appparent
   thickening of left atrial appendage may artifactual due to wall

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-23**]:
   - Started Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **], Azithromycin for atypical
   coverage.
   - Urine legionella and flu were negative
   - All cultures, HIV, and minibal are pending
   - LE US - initial read no DVT, will restart heparin with final read
   - off BIPAP([**7-31**]), tolerating nc well on 6L
   - continue diuresis -1.6 L at 4pm, 5pm lytes checked, given additional
   dose of lasix, checking [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   - CTA - final: No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection. Diffuse
   central perihilar ground-glass opacification, bilateral pleural
   effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery
   hypertension is most consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   Differential diagnosis, however, does include interstitial pneumonia
   such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] well as pulmonary hemorrhage, drug hypersensitivity,
   sarcoid and alveolar proteinosis although these seem less likely.
   Recommend rescan after treatment to ensure no underlying process.
   Vascular including dense coronary artery calcifications.  Appparent
   thickening of left atrial appendage may artifactual due to wall
   apposition or could represent thrombus. Correlation with clinical
   history and echocardiogram suggested.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy admitted to the ICU for marked hypoxia and likely cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) exacerbation. He was initially suspected to have a pulmonary embolism (PE), but further evaluation and imaging revealed no evidence of PE. The patient has been started on empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia (PNA) with azithromycin, and induced sputum cultures are pending. He has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and is being monitored closely for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his underlying lung disease and the use of antibiotics.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent exacerbation of CPE puts him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent contrast exposure put him at risk for further kidney injury, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or even end-stage renal disease.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and CPE exacerbation put him at risk for developing respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
5. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and chronic kidney disease put him at risk for developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute heart failure (CHF), systolic, acute on chronic, and pulmonary embolism (PE), acute. He was started on Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG and Azithromycin for atypical coverage. The patient's urine legionella and flu were negative, and all cultures, HIV, and minibal are pending. The patient is on heparin with a final read of no DVT, and the CTA shows diffuse central perihilar ground-glass opacification, bilateral pleural effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary artery hypertension consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's temperature spiked to 101°F, and he was given Tylenol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving diuresis and has a fluid balance of -1,695 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.48, PaO2 of 24, and PaCO2 of 67.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6, hemoglobin of 26.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 324 K/uL. His troponin-T levels are less than 0.01, and his creatinine levels are 1.1-1.3 mg/dL. His other lab results include elevated levels of D-dimer, LDH, and troponin-T.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse central perihilar ground-glass opacification and bilateral pleural effusions may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's spiked temperature and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis.
4. DVT: Despite the patient being on heparin, there is still a risk of developing DVT.
5. VAP: The patient's respiratory support and indwelling lines may increase the risk of VAP.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney injury.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for any signs of deterioration.
2. Continue to provide respiratory support and diuresis as needed.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to minimize the risk of cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient for signs of sepsis and take prompt action if sepsis is suspected.
5. Consider performing a repeat CTA to evaluate for any changes in the patient's pulmonary embolism.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of DVT and VAP and take prompt action if either condition is suspected.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and take prompt action if any signs of bleeding are noted.
8. Monitor the patient's kidney function and take prompt action if any signs of kidney injury are noted.
9. Consider performing a stress test to evaluate the patient's cardiac function."

   # Respiratory Distress
 Initially thought to be [**1-25**] PE, now thought to
   be [**1-25**] CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue supplemental O2 with NC.
   - Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses.  Expect improved hypoxia
   with continued diuresis.
   - Empiric abx therapy for ?PNA with azithromycin.
   - Send induced sputum cx.

   evidence of CAD.  The patient has multiple risk factors including
   hypertension, hyperlipidema, and tobacco abuse.  EKG does not show
   evidence of acute ischemia.  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.
   - Continue aspirin and statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-23**]:
   - Started Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **], Azithromycin for atypical
   coverage.
   - Urine legionella and flu were negative
   - All cultures, HIV, and minibal are pending
   - LE US - initial read no DVT, will restart heparin with final read
   - off BIPAP([**7-31**]), tolerating nc well on 6L
   - continue diuresis -1.6 L at 4pm, 5pm lytes checked, given additional
   dose of lasix, checking [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   - CTA - final: No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection. Diffuse
   central perihilar ground-glass opacification, bilateral pleural
   effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery
   hypertension is most consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   Differential diagnosis, however, does include interstitial pneumonia
   such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] well as pulmonary hemorrhage, drug hypersensitivity,
   sarcoid and alveolar proteinosis although these seem less likely.
   Recommend rescan after treatment to ensure no underlying process.
   Vascular including dense coronary artery calcifications.  Appparent
   thickening of left atrial appendage may artifactual due to wall
   apposition or could represent thrombus. Correlation with clinical
   history and echocardiogram suggested.
   - spiked a temp to 101 - re-cultured, given tylenol.

* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.3/86.3/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 114/5/<0.01, ALT/AST: 15/32, Alk Phos/T Bili: 136/0.5, D-dimer: 2829 ng/mL, LDH: 281 IU/L, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications are as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the bilateral pleural effusions and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
* Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and is currently experiencing volume overload, which may lead to cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and may be at risk of renal failure due to the increasing Crn levels.
* Infection: The patient has been started on empiric antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia, and there is a risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
* Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are not mentioned in the note, but there is a risk of hyperkalemia due to the patient's kidney disease and the use of potassium-sparing diuretics.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue supplemental oxygen with a nasal cannula
* Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses
* Empiric antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia
* Restart heparin therapy if the LE Doppler is positive
* Monitor I/Os and daily weights
* Goal diuresis of approximately 2 to 2.5 L
* Restart metoprolol and valsartan
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and renal failure."
