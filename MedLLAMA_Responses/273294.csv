   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear history of
   antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that the patient
   is a hospital SW.  In addition, given suspicion for post-influenza
   pneumonia, S.aureus is also a concern. Will also treat with
   ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
   - Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
   - f/u Influenza swab
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver recs
   - Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage. Vasopressors and
   IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
   - Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out hepatoadrenal
   syndrome. (results pending this morning)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
   - Consult hepatology
   - Patient is not currently on lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 2911**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off
   for now pending hepatology evaluation.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a
   potential etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs.
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   .
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear history of
   antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that the patient
   is a hospital SW.  In addition, given suspicion for post-influenza
   pneumonia, S.aureus is also a concern. Will also treat with
   ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
   - Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
   - f/u Influenza swab
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver recs
   - Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage. Vasopressors and
   IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
   - Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out hepatoadrenal
   syndrome. (results pending this morning)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
   - Consult hepatology
   - Patient is not currently on lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 2911**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off
   for now pending hepatology evaluation.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a
   potential etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs.
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   .
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU from an OSH with a diagnosis of PNA, ARF, and encephalopathy. She presented with a 3-6 week prodrome of ILI symptoms, including sore throat, non-productive cough, myalgias, and headache, which worsened before presentation with T103 at home. She was treated with ceftriaxone at the OSH and developed hypotension, which was treated with dopamine. Upon arrival to the MICU, she was intubated and had a central IJ placed for pressors, as well as an ART line for ABG draw and BP monitoring. She was pan-cultured and started on Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro for empiric coverage of PNA and abdominal causes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms are concerning for either influenza or post-influenza bacterial pneumonia, and she currently meets criteria for ARDS.
2. Severe sepsis: The patient's hypoxia and hypotension are concerning for an infectious process, and she has criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a differential diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia, ATN, or HRS, and her FeNa and PFI suggest pre-renal azotemia.
4. Liver disease: The patient has MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
6. Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy are likely secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a potential etiology.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to an infectious process.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is to be ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings, and her FiO2 and PEEP are to be titrated by ABG. She is to receive empiric HAP pneumonia coverage with Vanco and pip/tazo, as well as ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage. She is also to receive Tamiflu for influenza coverage. Diagnostic paracentesis is to be performed to evaluate for SBP or urosepsis. The patient's UOP and lactate are to be monitored for signs of end organ damage, and vasopressors and IVF are to be used as necessary. A cosyntropin stimulation test is to be performed to rule out hepatoadrenal syndrome. The patient is to be followed closely for signs of worsening liver disease, and lactulose and rifaximin are to be held pending hepatology evaluation."

   OSH Cultures: GNR in 2 blood cultures.  Can call tomorrow for

   All other cultures are negative to date and still pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear history of
   antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that the patient
   is a hospital SW.  In addition, given suspicion for post-influenza
   pneumonia, S.aureus is also a concern. Will also treat with
   ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
   - Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
   - f/u Influenza swab
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver recs
   - fluid resuscitation with NS and albumin 50g
   - Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage. Vasopressors and
   IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
   - Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out hepatoadrenal
   syndrome. (results pending this morning)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.   Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
   - Consult hepatology
   - Patient is not currently on lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 2911**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off
   for now pending hepatology evaluation.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a
   potential etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs.
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   .

   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress, encephalopathy, and fever. She has a history of influenza-like illness with a 3-6 week prodrome of sore throat, non-productive cough, myalgias, and headache.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: She has bilateral infiltrates on CXR and meets criteria for ARDS.
* Severe sepsis: She has hypoxia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which are concerning for an infectious process.
* Acute renal failure: She has pre-renal azotemia, and her FeNa and PFI suggest inadequate perfusion.
* Liver disease: She has acute decompensation of her HCV cirrhosis, likely due to sepsis and ARDS.
* Hyponatremia: She has hypovolemia in the setting of SIRS.
* Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: She has chronic thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy, which could be secondary to portal hypertension, worsening HCV cirrhosis, or DIC.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Progressive respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or cardiac arrest
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhage due to coagulopathy and portal hypertension
* Need for blood transfusions and platelet support due to thrombocytopenia and anemia
* Potential for nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypocalcemia, due to liver disease and kidney dysfunction
* Need for liver transplantation or other interventions to manage her underlying liver disease.

The patient is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, antiviral medications, and supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors. Her laboratory results and imaging studies are pending, and she is being closely monitored for signs of deterioration or improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear history of
   antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that the patient
   is a hospital SW.  In addition, given suspicion for post-influenza
   pneumonia, S.aureus is also a concern. Will also treat with
   ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
   - Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
   - f/u Influenza swab
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - abdominal u/s to look for fluid to possible tap for SBP diagnosis
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver recs if indicated by abdominal u/s
   - fluid resuscitation with NS and albumin 50g
   - Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage. Vasopressors and
   IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
   - Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out hepatoadrenal
   syndrome. (results pending this morning)
   - levophed and vasopressin drips as needed.  Vasopressin to try and
   wean levophed drip.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.   Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - Volume rescucitation w/ 3 amps bicab in D5W  d/t acidosis
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a
   potential etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs.
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   .
   FEN: tube feeds and nutrition consult, replete as necessary, IVF as
   above.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU from an OSH after presenting with cough, fever, and encephalopathy. She was intubated and started on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient has been stable since admission, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/56 mmHg. She has a history of 3-6 week ILI prodrome and was treated with ceftriaxone at the OSH. The patient has a high suspicion of post-influenza bacterial pneumonia and is being treated with Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires invasive ventilation. There is a high risk of further deterioration and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high suspicion of sepsis, and her laboratory results show leukocytosis, tachypnea, and hypoxia. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for vasopressors and IV fluids.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a high risk of acute renal failure due to hypotension, and her laboratory results show azotemia. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for dialysis.
4. Liver Disease: The patient has MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute decompensation, and her liver function is likely to deteriorate further. There is a risk of further complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia/Anemia/Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy, which are likely secondary to portal hypertension, splenic sequestration, and worsening HCV cirrhosis. There is a risk of further bleeding and potential need for transfusions.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to an infectious process, and there is a risk of further complications such as sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and vasopressors as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's liver disease with lactulose and Hepatology recommendations.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as necessary to prevent bleeding.
6. Continue to trend the patient's WBC and monitor for signs of infection.
7. Consider consulting a nutritionist for tube feeds and nutrition support.
8. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist for further management of the patient's liver disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, presenting with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, cirrhosis, pneumonia, and acidosis. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL, FIO2 of 80%, and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has a history of encephalopathy and is unable to provide a medical history. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury. The patient's renal function is also compromised, with a urine output of less than 30 cc/hour.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and acute lung injury increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's gram-negative bacteremia and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury and low urine output increase the risk of further kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can worsen respiratory failure, increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, and potentially lead to multi-organ failure.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia increase the risk of secondary infections, which can further compromise the patient's condition.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the ICU care plan includes:

1. Maintenance of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL, FIO2 of 80%, and PEEP of 12 cmH2O.
2. Administration of antibiotics to treat the patient's bacteremia and pneumonia.
3. Management of the patient's fluid status, including the use of diuretics and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory and renal function, including the use of laboratory tests and imaging studies to assess lung and kidney function.
5. Consideration of invasive interventions, such as dialysis and mechanical ventilation, to support the patient's failing organs.
6. Implementation of stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis to prevent complications.
7. Regular interdisciplinary rounds to assess the patient's condition and adjust the care plan as necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent further deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications."

   - Hep recs: give alb 25g, Abd us to eval for ascites. Elevated Tbili
   likely due to infxn. Would give additional 25g albumin (done), f/u
   blood and urine cx's, continue hold Lasix and Aldactone, get abd u/s
   (done). Attndg recs get an echo for 2/6 systolic murmur (not ordered)
   - Started on TF's but had high residuals so stopped
   - Pt breath stacking? Has small double-digit Tv's and then subsequent
   large Tv breaths. Increased sedation modestly (now at Versed 6). Went
   up on PEEP (to 15) with goal to go down on Fi02 (currently 80%, haven't
   weaned).
   - 1015pm 7.31/46/74/24

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Try to wean down PEEP first this am, now that pt is oxygenating
   better. Try to get her back down to 15, then down on FiO2, as
   tolerated.
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, can consider stopping Tamiflu, but she is
   still quite ill
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso)
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses, as pt
   now hyponatremic with 2L D5W yesterday
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Repeat fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if
   persistently elevated.
   FEN: tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2159-12-29**] 12:00 PM
   abdominal
   [**12-29**]:
   - goal urine output 50cc/hour
   - 25 albumin  --> did she get it?
   - D5W with 3A bicarb @150cc/hour  --> for 2L
   - started lactulose, rifaximin, vasopressin
   - abdominal u/s: Moderate amount of ascites, with the largest pocket in
   the right lower quadrant.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test -->  failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim, started on Hydrocortisone
   - Hep recs: give alb 25g, Abd us to eval for ascites. Elevated Tbili
   likely due to infxn. Would give additional 25g albumin (done), f/u
   blood and urine cx's, continue hold Lasix and Aldactone, get abd u/s
   (done). Attndg recs get an echo for 2/6 systolic murmur (not ordered)
   - Started on TF's but had high residuals so stopped
   - Pt breath stacking? Has small double-digit Tv's and then subsequent
   large Tv breaths. Increased sedation modestly (now at Versed 6). Went
   up on PEEP (to 15) with goal to go down on Fi02 (currently 80%, haven't
   weaned).
   - 1015pm 7.31/46/74/24
   - Discuss doing a para on her --> only small ascites on u/s though
   - Maintaining UOP ~50/hr, CVP 8, so bolused 500cc D5W with HCO3
   [**12-30**]
   - O2 trending down so increased PEEP to 17, FiO2 still 80%, put in
   reverse Tberg, and getting CXR

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Try to wean down PEEP first this am, now that pt is oxygenating
   better. Try to get her back down to 15, then down on FiO2, as
   tolerated.
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, can consider stopping Tamiflu, but she is
   still quite ill
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso)
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr

   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses, as pt
   now hyponatremic with 2L D5W yesterday
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.

   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.

Based on the provided medical progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital after presenting with cough, headache, encephalopathy, and fever. She has a complex medical condition with multiple organ dysfunction, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, meeting criteria for ARDS. She is being ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension, concerning for an infectious process. Potential sources of sepsis include bacterial pneumonia, influenza, or other infectious sources.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with a differential diagnosis including pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Her urine output is meeting the goal of 50cc/hour.
4. Liver disease: The patient has acute decompensation of her cirrhosis, likely due to sepsis and ARDS. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are rising, and she has low albumin levels.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of sepsis, and then received 2L of D5W with bicarbonate.
6. Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy, which may be secondary to portal hypertension, splenic sequestration, or worsening HCV cirrhosis.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely due to an infectious process.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia likely due to the 2L of D5W she received today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure and ARDS
2. Sepsis-related organ failure, including renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular failure
3. Acute kidney injury progression to chronic kidney disease
4. Liver failure and decompensation
5. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
6. Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or septic shock
7. Hyperglycemic coma or ketoacidosis
8. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypophosphatemia.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support, and is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition."

   - Hep recs: give alb 25g, Abd us to eval for ascites. Elevated Tbili
   likely due to infxn. Would give additional 25g albumin (done), f/u
   blood and urine cx's, continue hold Lasix and Aldactone, get abd u/s
   (done). Attndg recs get an echo for 2/6 systolic murmur (not ordered)
   - Started on TF's but had high residuals so stopped
   - Pt breath stacking? Has small double-digit Tv's and then subsequent
   large Tv breaths. Increased sedation modestly (now at Versed 6). Went
   up on PEEP (to 15) with goal to go down on Fi02 (currently 80%, haven't
   weaned).
   - 1015pm 7.31/46/74/24

   - abdominal u/s: Moderate amount of ascites, with the largest pocket in
   the right lower quadrant.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test -->  failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim, started on Hydrocortisone
   - Hep recs: give alb 25g, Abd us to eval for ascites. Elevated Tbili
   likely due to infxn. Would give additional 25g albumin (done), f/u
   blood and urine cx's, continue hold Lasix and Aldactone, get abd u/s
   (done). Attndg recs get an echo for 2/6 systolic murmur (not ordered)
   - Started on TF's but had high residuals so stopped
   - Pt breath stacking? Has small double-digit Tv's and then subsequent
   large Tv breaths. Increased sedation modestly (now at Versed 6). Went
   up on PEEP (to 15) with goal to go down on Fi02 (currently 80%, haven't
   weaned).
   - 1015pm 7.31/46/74/24
   - Discuss doing a para on her --> only small ascites on u/s though
   - Maintaining UOP ~50/hr, CVP 8, so bolused 500cc D5W with HCO3
   [**12-30**]
   - O2 trending down so increased PEEP to 17, FiO2 still 80%, put in
   reverse Tberg, and getting CXR

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her down of FiO2 first today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, will stop Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Repeat fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if
   persistently elevated.
   FEN: tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.
   PPx: SCDs, Pepcid
   Access: RIJ CVL, PIV (18, 20g), arterial line
   Code: Full (confirmed)
   Communication: [**Known lastname **],[**Name (NI) **] (husband) [**Telephone/Fax (5) 10199**]
   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred from an outside hospital after presenting with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to support her blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing a secondary infection due to her prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppressed state. She is at risk of developing a nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not adequately managed. She may require long-term mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. She may require dialysis and have a increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
4. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may progress to liver failure if not managed properly. She may require liver transplantation and have a increased risk of developing liver cancer.
5. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis may progress to septic shock if not managed properly. She may require vasopressors and other supportive therapy.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding and developing a coagulopathy-related complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly. She may require blood transfusions and have a increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding and developing a thrombocytopenia-related complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if not managed properly. She may require fluid restriction and electrolyte supplementation.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen if not managed properly. She may require nutritional support and have a increased risk of developing complications such as pressure ulcers and infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage her sepsis with antibiotics and vasopressors as needed.
3. Monitor her renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
4. Monitor her liver function and adjust her management plan accordingly.
5. Monitor her coagulopathy and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Monitor her anemia and adjust her blood transfusion therapy as needed.
7. Monitor her thrombocytopenia and adjust her platelet transfusion therapy as needed.
8. Monitor her hyponatremia and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
9. Monitor her nutritional status and adjust her nutritional support as needed.
10. Consider transferring the patient to a liver transplant center if her liver disease progresses."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple complex medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note highlights several significant alterations in their condition.

The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
2. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF)
3. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction)
4. Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality)
5. Alteration in Nutrition

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives, to manage their condition. They are also receiving mechanical ventilation and have an arterial line and central venous catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of ARDS, leading to increased respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
2. Progression of renal failure, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT)
3. Development of multi-organ dysfunction, including cardiac, hepatic, and gastrointestinal dysfunction
4. Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)
5. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia
6. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance
7. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction
8. Potential need for surgical intervention, such as tracheostomy or laparotomy, to manage underlying conditions

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is crucial to detecting any potential complications and adjusting their treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Renal Failure, Sepsis, and Hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/51 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 330 mL and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values, including:

* WBC count: 25.8
* Hct: 30.9
* Plt: 50
* Cr: 2.3
* TCO2: 19
* Glucose: 314
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 24.0 / 46.2 / 2.3, ALT / AST: 91 / 266, Alk Phos / T Bili: 150 / 9.1, Differential-Neuts: 75.0 % / Band: 5.0 % / Lymph: 8.0 % / Mono: 5.0 % / Eos: 0.0 % / D-dimer: 8037 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 313 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 3.2 mmol/L, Albumin: 1.9 g/dL, LDH: 435 IU/L, Ca++: 7.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Nutrition: Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)
* Glycemic Control: Insulin infusion
* Lines: Arterial line, central venous catheter, and multiple lumen catheter
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis
* Medications: Vasopressin, levophed, hydrocortisone, and other medications as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is acute, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency is suspected, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
8. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient's acid-base imbalance is severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection, particularly with the use of invasive lines and catheters.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her PEEP today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, stopped Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - consider diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stop tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her PEEP today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, stopped Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - consider diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stop tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with ARDS, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with various potential complications and underlying causes.

Potential medical complications that may arise or are already present include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR demonstrates patchy bilateral infiltrates, which could be indicative of pneumonia. The patient's symptoms, including cough, fever, and sore throat, also suggest a potential infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis is likely caused by a bacterial or viral infection, which could lead to further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by inadequate perfusion due to hypotension. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the need for dialysis.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver disease is likely worsening due to sepsis and ARDS, which could lead to further complications such as encephalopathy, bleeding, and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding complications, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could lead to bleeding complications, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia could lead to further complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, and death.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension could lead to further complications such as cardiovascular instability, which could require the use of vasopressors and other medications.

The patient's treatment plan includes ventilatory support, antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and management of electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her PEEP today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, stopped Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, and the respiratory support is being continued. However, the patient's condition may deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, and the source of infection is unclear. The patient's condition may worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN, and HRS. The patient's condition may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease.
4. Liver failure: The patient has liver disease, and the condition is worsening. The patient's condition may deteriorate further, leading to liver failure.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may worsen if the patient's volume status is not properly managed.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may worsen if the patient's bleeding is not properly managed.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen if the patient's bleeding is not properly managed.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which may worsen if the patient's bleeding is not properly managed.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may worsen if the patient's glucose levels are not properly managed.
10. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.

The patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis, PNA, ARDS, and no definitive bug, but suspected to be influenza or influenza with superinfection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 98.4°F (36.9°C)
* Heart rate: 81 bpm (normal range)
* Blood pressure: 110/63 mmHg (normal range)
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (normal range)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL (normal range)
* White blood cell count: 45 K/uL (normal range)
* Platelet count: 41 (normal range)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 125 mg/dL (normal range)
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL (normal range)
* Glucose: 27.5% (normal range)
* Electrolytes: Sodium: 133 mEq/L (normal range), Potassium: 4.6 mEq/L (normal range), Chloride: 98 mEq/L (normal range), Bicarbonate: 26 mEq/L (normal range)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL, icteric
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no bowel sounds present, distended
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: 3+, Left lower extremity edema: 3+
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Unresponsive, no movement or tone assessed

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Alteration in nutrition: Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality)
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, acute lung injury)
* Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
* Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, respiratory acidosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Acute kidney injury: Progression to chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis, and electrolyte imbalance
* Sepsis: Organ dysfunction, multi-organ failure, and increased risk of mortality
* Hypovolemia: Decreased cardiac output, decreased blood pressure, and decreased peripheral perfusion
* Hyponatremia: Seizures, cerebral edema, and increased risk of mortality
* Abdominal distension: Bowel obstruction, perforation, and peritonitis
* Ileus: Prolonged bowel dysfunction, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance

Given the patient's critical illness, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - consider diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with ARDS, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and liver disease. She was transferred from an outside hospital with a history of cough, fever, and encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. She has a positive fluid balance, hypotension, and tachypnea. Her lab results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. She has also developed hyperglycemia and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to organ failure and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver disease may progress, leading to further decompensation and organ failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to further complications such as seizures and coma.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue ventilatory support, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotics. The patient will also be monitored for signs of sepsis, acute kidney injury, and liver failure. The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia will be closely monitored, and bleeding complications will be managed promptly. The patient's hyperglycemia and hyponatremia will be managed with insulin and fluid resuscitation, respectively. The patient's liver disease will be managed with lactulose and Hepatology recommendations."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - consider diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension, hypoxia, and encephalopathy. The patient's condition is concerning for ARDS, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 130, indicating severe hypoxia. The patient is ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings, with PEEP weaned to 8 and then back to 10 due to low O2 saturation. The plan is to attempt to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also critical, with hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and her cardiac index is 2.4 L/min. The patient is receiving vasopressin and midazolam infusions to support her blood pressure and sedate her.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL and a urine output of 50 cc/hour. The patient's liver function is also impaired, with a total bilirubin level of 14.5 mg/dL and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.6.

The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a sodium level of 136 mmol/L and a potassium level of 4.1 mmol/L. The patient's blood glucose level is 138 mg/dL, and her hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a platelet count of 49 x 10^9/L, an INR of 2.6, and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 44.7 seconds. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are also abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 277 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 95 IU/L.

The patient's diagnosis is complicated by the presence of ARDS, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing pneumonia due to her prolonged intubation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is severe, and she is at risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure is severe, and she is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is at risk of developing liver failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and she is at risk of developing bleeding complications if not managed promptly and effectively.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and she is at risk of developing hyperglycemic coma if not managed promptly and effectively.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk of developing bleeding complications if not managed promptly and effectively.

To prevent these complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. The patient's respiratory, hemodynamic, and renal status should be closely monitored and managed, and her electrolyte levels should be carefully controlled. The patient's coagulation profile should be closely monitored and managed, and her liver function should be carefully monitored and managed. The patient's blood glucose level should be carefully controlled, and her platelet count should be closely monitored and managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU with ARDS, liver disease, and severe sepsis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and ventilated with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. She has bilateral infiltrates on CXR and meets criteria for ARDS.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension requiring vasopressors, and her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's CVP is 8 mmHg, and her total fluid balance is -236 mL.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, and her creatinine is rising. Her FeNa is 0.2 and PFI is 0.3, suggesting pre-renal azotemia.
* Liver: The patient has MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely due to sepsis and ARDS. Her LFTs are rising, and her albumin is low.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. Her platelet count is 42, and her INR is 2.6.
* Endocrine: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely due to 2L of D5W received today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis may progress to septic shock, leading to cardiovascular collapse.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Liver failure: The patient's HCV cirrhosis may worsen, leading to liver failure and portal hypertension.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to a hyperglycemic crisis.
7. Infection: The patient's sepsis may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications as necessary. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored, and electrolyte imbalances should be addressed promptly. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and liver transplantation should be considered if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient, a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of ARDS, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and liver disease.
* She is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/62 mmHg.
* Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy, which are consistent with sepsis and liver disease.
* The patient's liver function tests are rising, and her albumin level is low.
* She has hyponatremia, which is likely due to hypovolemia and SIRS.
* Her platelet count is worsening, and she has anemia and coagulopathy.
* The patient is at risk for complications such as bleeding, infection, and organ failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and mechanically ventilated, but she may require further respiratory support or escalation of care if her condition deteriorates.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, tachypnea, and hypotension suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis if not managed properly.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver disease may worsen, leading to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or bleeding.
5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia make her at risk for bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis and ARDS make her at risk for secondary infections, which can be challenging to manage and may worsen her outcome.
7. Organ failure: The patient's liver, kidney, and respiratory failure make her at risk for multiple organ failure, which can be fatal if not managed promptly and effectively.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation.
2. Aggressive management of her sepsis, including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control measures.
3. Optimization of her fluid and electrolyte status to prevent hypovolemia and hyponatremia.
4. Management of her liver disease, including administration of lactulose and folate and B12 supplementation.
5. Close monitoring of her platelet count and coagulation status to prevent bleeding.
6. Aggressive management of her acute kidney injury, including administration of diuretics and consideration of renal replacement therapy.
7. Early recognition and management of secondary infections, including administration of antibiotics and source control measures.
8. Close monitoring of her liver function tests and albumin level to prevent further liver damage."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis, admitted with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely caused by influenza. She has been improving, with weaning off pressors and stabilization of ascites. The patient has acute renal failure, septic shock, and hypotension. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter. The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, anemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is improving, but there is a risk of further deterioration or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is improving, but there is a risk of further decline or development of chronic kidney disease.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration or development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is a risk of further decline or development of shock.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters are abnormal, which may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection, including VAP, catheter-related bloodstream infection, or sepsis.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if the patient develops varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy.
9. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis may increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, especially if the patient develops liver failure or worsening liver function.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and septic shock may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock."

   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient, a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, is critically ill and experiencing multiple organ dysfunction. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of ARDS, sepsis, acute renal failure, and liver disease.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* HR: 85 bpm
* BP: 111/59 mmHg
* RR: 30 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 93%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings, and the PEEP is being weaned to 8 cmH2O. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 11.8
* Hct: 27.9
* Plt: 42
* Cr: 1.2
* TCO2: 29
* Glucose: 139
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* LDH: 308 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 3.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: improved lucency of parenchyma
* Micro: gram-negative rods in urine culture

The patient's medical conditions include:

* CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
* ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
* HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
* ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY)
* RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
* SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued deterioration of respiratory function, leading to worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure
* Progression of sepsis, leading to further organ dysfunction and failure
* Development of acute kidney injury, leading to worsening renal failure
* Increased risk of bleeding, due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
* Increased risk of infection, due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines and catheters
* Development of liver failure, leading to worsening jaundice and coagulopathy

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue mechanical ventilation with a volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings
* Wean PEEP to 8 cmH2O and FiO2 to 40%
* Monitor for signs of worsening respiratory failure, including increasing oxygen requirements and worsening hypoxia
* Continue antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Monitor for signs of sepsis, including worsening organ dysfunction and failure
* Monitor for signs of acute kidney injury, including increasing creatinine and urea levels
* Monitor for signs of bleeding, including decreased platelet count and increased bleeding risk
* Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and increased C-reactive protein
* Consider further imaging studies, including CT torso, if the patient's condition does not improve
* Consider consultation with gastroenterology and nephrology services to optimize management of liver and kidney disease."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon tomorrow to
   evaluate a good PEEP for her

   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis; goal even to negative.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely

   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.

   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital due to worsening symptoms of cough, headache, encephalopathy, and fever. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications arising from her underlying liver disease, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving ventilator support with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings, with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is 111/59 mmHg, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 2 mmHg. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her oxygen saturation is 93%.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and her urine output is 2,060 mL over the past 24 hours.

* Infections: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is at risk for sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS can progress to acute respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, requiring dialysis.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver failure can progress, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and death.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia can worsen, leading to seizures and brain damage.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Ventilatory support: The patient will continue to receive ventilator support with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient will receive antibiotic therapy for her UTI and sepsis.
3. Fluid management: The patient will receive fluid resuscitation as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output.
4. Nutrition: The patient will receive elemental tube feeds, and her nutrition will be replete as necessary.
5. Blood product transfusions: The patient may require blood product transfusions to support her coagulopathy and anemia.
6. Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's hemodynamic status will be closely monitored to ensure that her blood pressure and CVP are within normal limits.
7. Renal function monitoring: The patient's renal function will be closely monitored to ensure that her creatinine level and urine output are within normal limits.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/64 mmHg. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and her fluid balance is negative, with a total fluid input of 1,076 mL and a total fluid output of 2,860 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a total count of 16.4 K/uL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L. Her coagulation studies show a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 43.3 seconds and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.6.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, with clear breath sounds and soft, non-tender abdomen. However, she has distended abdomen and bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's medical history is significant for cirrhosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute renal failure. She is also on medications for nausea, vomiting, and anxiety.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level, there is a high risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PTT and INR may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis may worsen, leading to hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition may lead to malnutrition and further compromise her immune function.
7. Infection: The patient's distended abdomen and bilateral lower extremity edema may increase the risk of infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning of PEEP and FiO2 to improve lung function.
2. Autodiuresis with lasix to hasten fluid output.
3. Holding of MS to prevent further sedation.
4. Stopping of reglan to prevent further nausea and vomiting.
5. Administration of lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Monitoring of laboratory results and adjustment of medications as necessary.
7. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory and renal function."

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon tomorrow to
   evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis; goal even to negative.
   - for alkalemia:
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr improved today.
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would try NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct, plt, coags stable today
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.
   -Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb.
   - resolved, hypernatremic today
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary, IVF as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt

   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,

Summary:

The patient, a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital after presenting with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever. She has a history of hypotension, hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings and has a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. She is also receiving antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is likely to progress, and she may require higher levels of PEEP or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen, and she may require more aggressive antibiotic therapy and source control measures.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI is likely to progress, and she may require renal replacement therapy (RRT).
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is likely to deteriorate, and she may require liver transplantation or other interventions to manage her liver failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to worsen, and she may require more aggressive management of her bleeding risk.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is likely to recur, and she may require more aggressive management of her glucose levels.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance is likely to worsen, and she may require more aggressive management of her electrolyte levels.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and adjust her antibiotic therapy and source control measures as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's AKI and adjust her fluid management and RRT as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her management as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust her bleeding risk management as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her insulin therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her electrolyte management as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of new infections and adjust her infection control measures as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon tomorrow to
   evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - diurese with goal -500cc to -1L today; give 20IV lasix now
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   - monitor mental status, as now off sedation, and need more alert for
   extubation
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr improved today.
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr
   - Renally dose all meds for new improved Cr
   - Lasix for diuresis today, as above
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12).
   - Hct, plt, coags stable today
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.

   electrolytes as necessary, hold IVF today as diuresis goal.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient, a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and liver decompensation. She is mechanically ventilated and receiving vasopressors for hypotension. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and she has a MELD score of 29.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening ARDS: The patient's oxygenation status is currently compromised, and she may require further escalation of ventilation and oxygen therapy to prevent further deterioration.
2. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis is severe, and she may require further antibiotic therapy and source control measures to prevent septic shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression: The patient's AKI is currently managed with diuretics, and close monitoring of her creatinine and urine output is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Liver decompensation: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may require further supportive care, such as lactulose therapy, to manage her encephalopathy.
5. Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count and coagulation profile are compromised, and close monitoring of her platelet count and coagulation studies is necessary to prevent bleeding and thrombotic complications.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are currently controlled, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent hyperglycemia and its associated complications.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are currently corrected, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's family has been informed about her condition, and they are aware of her liver status. The patient's husband has been contacted, and he is aware of her condition and the ICU care plan.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is receiving ICU-level care. Her nutrition is being managed with tube feeds, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with cirrhosis, respiratory failure, and sepsis. She is improving, but still critically ill.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 102 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 133/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 1 mmHg

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL and a respiratory rate of 30 bpm. She is also receiving oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.8 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 42 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30.6 mg/dL
* Sodium: 139 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L
* Chloride: 111 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 31 mmol/L
* Glucose: 144 mg/dL
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include cirrhosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, sepsis, and hypotension. She is also at risk for fluid overload, coagulopathy, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of ARDS, need for increased oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis: worsening of septic shock, need for increased vasopressor support or antibiotics
* Renal failure: worsening of acute renal failure, need for dialysis
* Coagulopathy: worsening of bleeding risk, need for platelet transfusions or anticoagulation therapy
* Anemia: worsening of anemia, need for blood transfusions
* Fluid overload: worsening of fluid overload, need for diuretic therapy or fluid restriction
* Infection: worsening of infection, need for increased antibiotic therapy or surgical intervention

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue to wean PEEP and FiO2
* Continue vanco/zosyn/cipro for pneumonia
* Continue hydrocort for adrenal insufficiency
* Continue diuresis for fluid overload
* Monitor for worsening of sepsis, ARDS, and renal failure
* Monitor for bleeding and anemia
* Monitor for infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.

   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - RUQ US and diagnostic paracentesis, per liver, to r/o SBP vs

   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130

   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.

   altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - If she doesn

   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital after presenting with cough, headache, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days. She has a history of hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her current condition is concerning for severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure. She has a fever of 101.9°F, hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Her laboratory results show hypernatremia, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are concerning for an infectious process. The possibility of bacterial pneumonia, influenza, or other sources of infection should be considered.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and her history of cough, fever, and sore throat for 2-3 weeks are concerning for ARDS. Other potential etiologies include idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs) or acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen levels are concerning for acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels are concerning for hypernatremia. The possibility of pre-renal azotemia, ATN, or HRS should be considered.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is concerning for bleeding or thrombosis. The possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be considered, although the laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.
6. Liver Disease: The patient's MELD score of 29 and elevated liver enzymes are concerning for acute decompensation of her liver disease. The possibility of liver failure should be considered.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is concerning for bleeding or thrombosis. The possibility of portal hypertension and splenic sequestration should be considered.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is concerning for bleeding or bone marrow failure. The possibility of liver failure or bleeding should be considered.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is concerning for diabetes or other metabolic disorders.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and radiological studies to assess the progression of her condition.
2. Consider antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia or other sources of infection.
3. Continue to provide supportive care for the patient's ARDS, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Consider dialysis for the patient's acute renal failure.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider IV fluids to treat hypernatremia.
6. Consider blood transfusions for the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
7. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
8. Consider a liver biopsy to assess the patient's liver disease.
9. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider blood transfusions if necessary."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - Add fluconazole for fungal coverage.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Add fluconazole as above
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - NS IVF; 1L for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - NS IVF for slow fluid repletion
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - Add fluconazole for fungal coverage.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Add fluconazole as above
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - NS IVF; 1L for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - NS IVF for slow fluid repletion
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure. She has a history of cough, fever, and sore throat for 2-3 weeks, which is concerning for influenza or post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and ventilated with a volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings. She has bilateral infiltrates on her chest X-ray and meets criteria for ARDS. She is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. Her urine output is low, and she has hypernatremia. She is being treated with IV fluids and diuretics to replete electrolytes and improve renal function.
* Hepatic: The patient has liver disease, with a MELD score of 29. She has acute decompensation, likely due to sepsis and ARDS. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are stable, but her bilirubin level is elevated.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. Her platelet count is low, and she has a prolonged prothrombin time (PTT). Her anemia is likely due to chronic disease, and her coagulopathy may be secondary to worsening liver disease.
* Infectious: The patient has a positive BAL culture for yeast, and her sputum culture is pending. She is being treated with antifungal medication, including fluconazole.
* Nutritional: The patient is receiving tube feeds with free water flushes to replete electrolytes and manage hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to her underlying liver disease and the presence of yeast in her BAL culture.
* ARDS: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to her ARDS and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on her chest X-ray.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient is at risk for further kidney injury due to her acute renal failure and the presence of hypernatremia.
* Hepatic failure: The patient is at risk for further liver failure due to her underlying liver disease and the presence of acute decompensation.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to her underlying liver disease and the presence of yeast in her BAL culture.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan should be considered:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
* Continue to manage her renal function with IV fluids and diuretics.
* Continue to manage her liver function with lactulose and other medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor her hematological status and adjust her platelet transfusions and other medications as needed.
* Consider adding antibiotics to her treatment regimen if her BAL culture grows a pathogen.
* Consider adding other medications to her treatment regimen to manage her sepsis and ARDS.
* Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her tube feeds as needed.
* Consider transferring the patient to a liver transplant center if her liver function continues to deteriorate."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with cirrhosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), who developed hypernatremia, tachycardia, and agitation overnight. She received boluses of versed and fentanyl, but attempts to wean her off sedation were unsuccessful. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 138/72 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory support plan in place.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis, PNA/ARDS, and acute renal failure. She has a high risk of developing sepsis and organ dysfunction due to her underlying medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions, and the presence of yeast in her sputum.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's cirrhosis and ARDS increase her risk of developing organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death if not treated promptly.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS can worsen and lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF can worsen and lead to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
6. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis increases her risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen her mental status and increase her risk of developing sepsis.
7. ICU Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion may be due to ICU delirium, which can worsen her mental status and increase her risk of developing sepsis.

Plan:

1. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia with free water flushes and add some D5W IVF.
2. Continue to wean the patient off sedation and assess her mental status regularly.
3. Continue to manage the patient's ARDS with mechanical ventilation and respiratory support.
4. Continue to manage the patient's ARF with diuretics and fluids.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment plan if her sputum culture grows a pathogen.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 3) for HAP.
   - CXR today to assess difficulty weaning, as well as fevers
   - Send beta glucan and C. diff to work up continued fevers and failure
   to wean
   - f/u RUQ US final read
   - Deferring diagnostic paracentesis for now, as insufficient amount of
   ascites to safely perform procedure
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 weaned
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h [**1-4**], wean to 25mg q12h [**1-5**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings. Attempted extubation.  Patient
   became agitated during SBP with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and
   hypertension to 180
s systolic.  Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and
   propofol.  Attempt another attempt to rapidly wean later today to
   minimize time off sedation.  Difficulty weaning from vent believed to
   be [**3-5**] encephalopathy vs. altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Transition to PSV today and repeat ABG
   - CXR, beta glucan to w/u possible causes of difficulty weaning from
   vent
   - Per liver, consider bronch to r/o VAP if pt does not improve or
   worsens
   - Per liver, consider fungal coverage if pt does not improve
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr in setting of 1L
   diarrhea/day and insensible losses [**3-5**] fever.
   - Calculated free water deficit 4.8L.  Administer continuous D5W IVF at
   125cc/hr for fluid repletion
   - Continue free water flushes 250cc q4h
   - Albumin given yesterday to decrease third spacing of fluids
   - Decrease lactulose to 30mg once today, then re-assess
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   - Repeat Hct; trend today to ensure pt not actively bleeding
   - Ensure active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.  Resolved with increased free water flushes and IVF.
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital with a hospital course complicated by hypotension, hypoxia, and encephalopathy. She has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure. She has also developed hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently intubated and ventilated, and is receiving antibiotics and other medications to treat her infections.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications due to her severe sepsis, including organ dysfunction, failure, and death.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is likely to progress, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is likely to worsen, leading to further decompensation and potential need for liver transplantation.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications, including seizures, cerebral edema, and potential death.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and potential death.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and potential death.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
9. Organ Failure: The patient is at risk for further organ failure, including respiratory, renal, and liver failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The plan is to continue antibiotics and other medications to treat her infections, and to manage her hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's family has been notified of her poor prognosis and has been invited to a family meeting to discuss her condition and potential end-of-life care."

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - RUQ US and diagnostic paracentesis, per liver, to r/o SBP vs
   intra-abdominal process such as cholangitis
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   Difficulty weaning from vent believed to be [**3-5**] encephalopathy vs.
   altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - Increase free water intake; increase free water flushes, D5W IVF 1L
   for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes tomorrow if renal failure worsens with increased
   free water
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - D5W IVF for slow fluid repletion
   - Increase free water flushes
   - Albumin to decrease third spacing of fluids
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - RUQ US and diagnostic paracentesis, per liver, to r/o SBP vs
   intra-abdominal process such as cholangitis
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   Difficulty weaning from vent believed to be [**3-5**] encephalopathy vs.
   altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - Increase free water intake; increase free water flushes, D5W IVF 1L
   for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes tomorrow if renal failure worsens with increased
   free water
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - D5W IVF for slow fluid repletion
   - Increase free water flushes
   - Albumin to decrease third spacing of fluids
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital due to severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is concerning for sepsis with a high likelihood of infectious sources including bacterial pneumonia, influenza, or urosepsis. The patient has a history of cough, fever, and sore throat for 2-3 weeks, and her chest X-ray demonstrates bilateral patchy infiltrates.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is currently ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings. She is also experiencing hypernatremia, which is likely secondary to inadequate fluid repletion. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and she is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The patient's liver function is compromised, with elevated liver enzymes and a MELD score of 29. She is at risk for further decompensation and liver failure.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. Her platelet count is low, and she has a high INR, which is likely secondary to liver failure and sepsis.

The patient's glucose levels are elevated, likely due to the administration of D5W. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia, continued fluid repletion with D5W, and close monitoring of her respiratory and renal function. She is also receiving albumin to decrease third spacing of fluids and to support her liver function.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Worsening sepsis and septic shock
2. Progression of ARDS and respiratory failure
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)
4. Liver failure and decompensation
5. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
6. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation
7. Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid repletion and medication administration
8. Increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response is essential to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a critically ill individual with cirrhosis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, shock, and sepsis. They are mechanically ventilated and have a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 91 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 111/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Sodium: 143 mmol/L (hypernatremia)
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL (acute renal failure)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 33 mg/dL
* Glucose: 157 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.2 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 42 x 10^9/L
* Coagulation studies: PT 33.9 seconds, PTT 56.4 seconds, INR 3.4

The patient's medical history is significant for cirrhosis, alcoholism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They have a history of septic shock and have received antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and liver dysfunction can lead to encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and mechanical ventilation can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and hepatic failure.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can lead to central nervous system complications, including seizures and coma.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient's cirrhosis and liver dysfunction can lead to hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Vitamin deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and liver dysfunction can lead to vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin K deficiency, which can cause bleeding diathesis.
8. Infection: The patient's sepsis and liver dysfunction can increase the risk of infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.

In light of these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these complications. The patient's family meeting should be planned to discuss the patient's condition, treatment options, and prognosis."
