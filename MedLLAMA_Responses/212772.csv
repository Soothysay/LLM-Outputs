   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with PMHx of ETOH pancreatitis s/p distal pancreatectomy and
   splenectomy now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with severe pancreatitis, elevated
   lactate & anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Pt with h/o severe pancreatitis c/b ARDS & requiring
   splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Pt presented with Ransons score
   of 1 but rising lactate and requiring aggressive IVF resussitation. Pt
   with new O2 requirement likely due to growing pleural effusions with
   some component of splinting due to pain.  Currently tachycardic &
   hypertensive, making adequate urine.  CT shows extensive inflammation,
   but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast. Will need repeat
   imagine after elective intubation to better assess for presence of
   necrosis.
   - Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR &/or Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u Surgery Recs, will need addl imaging CT vs MRI
CT Abdomen with
   contrast  -if necrotizing pancreatitis, surgical intervention.
   - add Imipenem if any e/o necrosis
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count & fever curve
   - Strict NPO & place OG tube to intermittent suction
   # Sedation: Patient is on proprofol, Midazolam, and fentanyl, with
   increasing requirements.  Will attempt to wean proprofol.  H/o DTs from
   etoh withdrawal. Patient is currently 24-48 hours since last drink.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) pancreatitis, who underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. He was transferred to the ICU due to severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate, and anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with increasing requirements of midazolam and fentanyl. He has a history of asthma, hypertension, and chronic pain. The patient is NPO and has an OG tube to intermittent suction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition can deteriorate due to the severity of pancreatitis, which can lead to organ failure, sepsis, and death.
2. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is at risk of severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and increased heart rate and blood pressure.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate due to the severity of pancreatitis, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status can deteriorate due to the severity of pancreatitis, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and wound infections, due to the severity of pancreatitis and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and obstruction, due to the severity of pancreatitis and the presence of an OG tube.
7. Renal Complications: The patient is at risk of developing renal complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, due to the severity of pancreatitis and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient is at risk of developing neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and brain death, due to the severity of pancreatitis and the presence of ETOH withdrawal.

Recommendations:

1. Aggressive management of pancreatitis, including IV fluid boluses and vasopressors, to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output.
2. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, including frequent ABG measurements and chest radiographs, to detect any signs of respiratory failure.
3. Management of ETOH withdrawal symptoms, including the use of benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants, to prevent seizures and hallucinations.
4. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status, including frequent ECG measurements and blood pressure monitoring, to detect any signs of cardiac arrhythmias or failure.
5. Aggressive management of infections, including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, to prevent sepsis and organ failure.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's gastrointestinal status, including frequent stool and urine output measurements, to detect any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.

   # Pancreatitis: Pt with h/o severe pancreatitis c/b ARDS & requiring
   splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Pt presented with Ransons score
   of 1 but rising lactate and requiring aggressive IVF resussitation. Pt
   with new O2 requirement likely due to growing pleural effusions with
   some component of splinting due to pain.  Currently tachycardic &
   hypertensive, making adequate urine.  CT shows extensive inflammation,
   but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast. Will need repeat
   imagine after elective intubation to better assess for presence of
   necrosis.
   - Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR &/or Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u Surgery Recs, will need addl imaging CT vs MRI
CT Abdomen with
   contrast  -if necrotizing pancreatitis, surgical intervention.
   - add Imipenem if any e/o necrosis
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count & fever curve
   - Strict NPO & place OG tube to intermittent suction
   # Sedation: Patient is on proprofol, Midazolam, and fentanyl, with
   increasing requirements.  Will attempt to wean proprofol.  H/o DTs from
   etoh withdrawal. Patient is currently 24-48 hours since last drink.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Amylase and lipase: 379 and 721 IU/L, respectively

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Pancreatitis: severe pancreatitis with elevated lactate and anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal
* Ethanol withdrawal: patient is 24-48 hours since last drink, with increasing requirements of midazolam and fentanyl
* Hypertension: likely due to ETOH withdrawal or pain
* Chronic pain: patient will be NPO on fentanyl gtt while intubated, and will need to restart chronic pain regimen including Methadone after wean from vent
* Hyperlipidemia: holding Gemfibrozil given strict NPO
* Asthma: patient on different inhalers, unclear baseline reactive airway disease or degree of medication compliance

The patient's medications include:

* Propofol: 10 mcg/kg/min
* Fentanyl: 300 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed): 15 mg/hour
* Diazepam (Valium): 5 mg q2hr for CIWA scale
* Imipenem: to be added if necrotizing pancreatitis
* Albuterol and atrovent nebs: after intubated
* Fentanyl and midazolam gtt: for sedation
* Gemfibrozil: holding due to strict NPO
* Methadone: to be restarted after wean from vent

The patient's plan includes:

* Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR and/or Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
* Repeat imaging (CT or MRI) to assess for presence of necrosis
* Add Imipenem if necrotizing pancreatitis
* Follow-up blood and urine cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol pancreatitis, s/p distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, who was transferred to the ICU with severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate, and anion gap. He is likely complicated by ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition is unstable, with tachycardia, hypertension, and new oxygen requirement due to growing pleural effusions. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a plan to repeat imaging after elective intubation to assess for presence of necrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe and may lead to further complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for severe ethanol withdrawal syndrome, which can lead to seizures, delirium, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be due to ethanol withdrawal or pain, and may require treatment with antihypertensive medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with acute pancreatitis, intubated and sedated, receiving supportive care in the ICU. He has a history of chronic medications, including benzodiazepines and opioids, and has undergone massive resuscitation for acidosis. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure of 136/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His laboratory results show increasing liver enzymes, decreased lipase and amylase, and resolved acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate has increased after the most recent ABG, indicating respiratory acidosis. This may require adjustments to his ventilator settings.
2. Sedation-related complications: The patient is heavily sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol, which may increase his risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and other complications.
3. Pancreatitis-related complications: The patient's pancreatitis is acute and may lead to further complications, such as bleeding, abscess formation, or sepsis.
4. Infection: The patient has had multiple lines and tubes inserted, which increases his risk of infection. He is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged intubation.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has received massive resuscitation for acidosis, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications, such as heart failure or pulmonary edema.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, which may worsen his condition.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, which may require further management.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to bleeding complications, such as hematemesis or melena, which may require urgent management.
9. Sepsis: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to sepsis, which may require urgent management and may have a high mortality rate.
10. Long-term complications: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to long-term complications, such as pancreatic dysfunction, malnutrition, or chronic pain, which may require ongoing management and rehabilitation."
