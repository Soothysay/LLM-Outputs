You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and low cardiac output may indicate shock, which could be secondary to dehydration, sepsis, or cardiogenic causes.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior TWI on EKG suggest a possible NSTEMI, which requires management and monitoring.
3. Tachy-arrhythmia: The patient's history of atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and defibrillation indicates a need for continued management and monitoring of cardiac rhythm.
4. Subacute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and prerenal azotemia suggest a need for close monitoring and management of renal function.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver dysfunction, which requires monitoring and management.
6. Abdominal pain/colitis: The patient's symptoms and CT findings suggest a possible colitis, which requires empiric antibiotic treatment and close monitoring.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stools suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires close monitoring and management.
8. Chronic heart failure: The patient's history of CHF and mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR requires ongoing management and monitoring.
9. Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: The patient's history of obstructive lung disease and allergic rhinitis requires ongoing management and monitoring.
10. Anxiety: The patient's history of anxiety requires ongoing management and monitoring.

The patient's medications include:

* Vasodilators: amiodarone, morphine
* Antibiotics: vancomycin, metronidazole, ceftriaxone
* Anti-arrhythmics: amiodarone
* Anti-anxiety medications: fluoxetine
* Anti-inflammatory medications: Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Pain medications: morphine, tramadol
* Anticoagulants: heparin
* Diuretics: lasix
* ACE inhibitors: metoprolol
* Statins: atorvastatin

The patient's lab results include:

* Troponins: elevated
* CK-MB: elevated
* Creatinine: 3.2
* BUN: 506
* Cr: 94
* Na: <10
* FeNa: 0.2%
* LFTs: elevated
* WBC: 8.7
* Hct: 29.3
* Plt: 145
* Cr: 2.7
* TropT: 0.86
* Glucose: 164
* Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies include:

* CXR: showing mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable right basilar atelectasis
* CT ab/pelvis: showing mild thickening along the transverse colon with associated stranding in the region of the hepatic flexure, post-cholecystectomy with increasing diameter of the common bile duct, and moderate fecal loading of the rectum.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing resuscitation with IV fluids and vasopressors
* Managing cardiac rhythm with amiodarone and cardioversion
* Monitoring and managing renal function with gentle fluid boluses and electrolyte repletion
* Trending LFTs and managing liver dysfunction
* Empiric antibiotic treatment for suspected colitis
* Managing gastrointestinal bleeding with PPI and guaiac testing
* Ongoing management of CHF, obstructive lung disease, and anxiety
* Monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely secondary to dehydration in setting of anorexia and
   nausea, together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline
   impaired cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on
   CXR, chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Consider AICD; cards consult today
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - If persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, will
   discontinue amiodarone and return to lopressor
   - Restart Coumadin for A-fib
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Continue albuterol,
   cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;  hold benadryl
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, NPO for now (regular heart
   healthy diet when taking POs). Folate. PPI.

   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR DNI but consider less aggressive interventions such as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2106-5-12**] 07:51 PM
 EKG - At [**2106-5-12**] 11:45 PM
   Patient developed CP associated with wheezing at ~8pm. EKG with
   anterior TWI and ST depression ~1 mm in V3-v4. Pain resolved with nebs,
   improved breathing. Second episode of CP less severe at 11:00 pm. TWI
   in V2-V4 still present, but ST depressions slightly improved. 3rd set
   still trending up, but CKs seem plateauing. CP again at ~1:00 am, given
   morphine for pain. Pain improved with talking with nurse, who felt it
   may be partly anxiety related.
   - Hypotensive to SBPs 60s-70s on and off throughout evening. Received 2
   boluses of 500 cc IVF. UOP somewhat poor at 25-40/hr, increasing this
   am to 40-120 cc/hr.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypotension, dyspnea, and chest pain (CP). She was cardioverted for atrial flutter and developed ventricular tachycardia (VTach), which was defibrillated and returned to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). She has been treated with amiodarone, morphine, and vasopressors.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Shock: likely secondary to dehydration, anorexia, and nausea, as well as recent rapid ventricular rates and baseline impaired cardiac function.
2. NSTEMI: elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior TWI on EKG, indicating a possible acute coronary syndrome.
3. Tachy-arrhythmia: possible atrial flutter and VTach, which was treated with cardioversion and defibrillation.
4. Subacute renal failure: creatinine 3.2, likely prerenal in setting of dehydration and chronic CHF.
5. Hepatitis: elevated LFTs, likely in setting of shock liver.
6. Abdominal pain/colitis: CT shows mild thickening along the transverse colon, with associated stranding in the region of the hepatic flexure, which may represent colitis.
7. GIB: guaiac-positive stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. CHF: hold lasix while hypotensive, hold Metoprolol, ACE-I, and spironolactone while hypotensive.
9. Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: continue albuterol, cromolyn spray, and fluticasone inhaler.
10. Anxiety: continue fluoxetine, hold trazodone for now.

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2106-5-12**] 07:51 PM
 EKG - At [**2106-5-12**] 11:45 PM
   Patient developed CP associated with wheezing at ~8pm. EKG with
   anterior TWI and ST depression ~1 mm in V3-v4. Pain resolved with nebs,
   improved breathing. Second episode of CP less severe at 11:00 pm. TWI
   in V2-V4 still present, but ST depressions slightly improved. 3rd set
   still trending up, but CKs seem plateauing. CP again at ~1:00 am, given
   morphine for pain. Pain improved with talking with nurse, who felt it
   may be partly anxiety related.
   - Hypotensive to SBPs 60s-70s on and off throughout evening. Received 2

   ischemic.  2. Post-cholecystectomy with increasing diameter of the
   common bile duct  compared with prior exam. Recommend clinical
   correlation and if needed  ultrasound may be obtained to further
   assess.  3. Moderate fecal loading of the rectum.   4. Fat and
   fluid-containing periumbilical hernia, stable.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U today
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - If persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, will
   discontinue amiodarone and return to lopressor
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Change albuterol to
   xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;  hold benadryl
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U today
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - If persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, will
   discontinue amiodarone and return to lopressor
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Change albuterol to

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CHF, Afib, and CABG, who presented with dyspnea and chest pain, was found to be hypotensive, and was cardioverted for atrial flutter. The patient developed ventricular tachycardia, was defibrillated, and returned to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%. She is currently in shock, which is likely cardiogenic in nature, complicated by dehydration and tachyarrhythmia. The patient's baseline blood pressure is low, and she has mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR.
* Respiratory: The patient has mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR and scattered expiratory wheezing on physical examination.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has mild thickening along the transverse colon with associated stranding in the region of the hepatic flexure, which may represent colitis. She also has a post-cholecystectomy with increasing diameter of the common bile duct.
* Renal: The patient has subacute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.2, which is likely prerenal in nature due to dehydration and chronic CHF.
* Hepatic: The patient has elevated LFTs, which are likely in the setting of shock liver.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is complicated by dehydration and tachyarrhythmia, which may worsen her condition.
* Sepsis: The patient has mild leukocytosis and colitis on CT, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
* NSTEMI: The patient has elevated troponins and anterior TWI on EKG, which suggests the possibility of NSTEMI.
* Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial flutter and developed ventricular tachycardia, which may require further management.
* Hepatitis: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may indicate the presence of hepatitis.
* Abdominal pain/colitis: The patient has mild thickening along the transverse colon with associated stranding in the region of the hepatic flexure, which may represent colitis.
* GIB: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may indicate the presence of GIB.
* CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, which may worsen her condition in the setting of cardiogenic shock and tachyarrhythmia.
* Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: The patient has a history of obstructive lung disease and allergic rhinitis, which may worsen her respiratory status.
* Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety, which may worsen her condition in the setting of cardiogenic shock and tachyarrhythmia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Cardioversion for atrial flutter
* Management of cardiogenic shock with fluid resuscitation and vasodilators
* Management of NSTEMI with cycle enzymes and anticoagulation
* Management of tachyarrhythmia with antiarrhythmic medications
* Management of hepatitis with antiviral medications
* Management of abdominal pain/colitis with empiric antibiotics and gentle enemas
* Management of GIB with proton pump inhibitors and stool guaiac tests
* Management of CHF with diuretics and vasodilators
* Management of obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis with bronchodilators and corticosteroids
* Management of anxiety with antidepressants and anxiolytics.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement in the ICU."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents and amio.
   - PCP agrees that medical treatment most c/w goals of care rather than
   ICD; suggests starting benzo; consider cxr and if enlarging effusion or
   evidence fluid
   overload diuresing a bit; restart flovent and consider PO steroids if
   continues to
   have respiratory difficulties; If transferred to floor would appreciate
   consultation and
   comanagement both from general/chf cardiology and pulmonary; may
   benefit from SW visit at home
   - No o/n events, rested overnight on trazadone
   - cardiac enzymes, LFT trending down
   - urine culture <10K (non-speciated)
   - TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with apical akinesis. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis (though likely ischemic colitis rather
   than infectious)
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation (no stool yet)
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia; likely demand vs ACS
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Appreciate cards consult
   - Continue ASA; discontinue atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Consider anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Cards c/s: pt with likely AVNRT on admission,
   converted to VT, then back to NSR.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver. Now trending down.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Abdominal pain resolving; colitis
   likely ischemic. Surgery consulted, recommend continue resuscitation,
   enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   - CXR given decreased BS today, crackles, fluid +
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis:
   - Change albuterol to xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;
   hold Benadryl
   - Restart flovent; consider steroids if continued respiratory
   difficulty
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now; start benzo per
   pcp
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, can start heart healthy
   diet, Folate. PPI.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR DNI but consider less aggressive interventions such as
   cardiovert/defib if short-term return to baseline status (see OMR note

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (Afib) who presents with dyspnea and chest pain. She was cardioverted for atrial flutter and developed ventricular tachycardia, which was defibrillated and returned to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Shock: likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia, dehydration, and baseline impaired cardiac function.
2. NSTEMI: elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior TWI on EKG, likely demand ischemia.
3. Tachy-arrhythmia: likely AVNRT on admission, converted to VT, and then back to NSR.
4. Subacute renal failure: creatinine 3.2, likely prerenal in setting of dehydration and chronic CHF.
5. Hepatitis: elevated LFTs, likely in setting of shock liver.
6. Abdominal pain/colitis: likely ischemic, with surgery consulted.
7. GIB: guaiac-positive stools.
8. CHF: hold lasix, Metoprolol, ACE-I, and spironolactone while hypotensive.
9. Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: change albuterol to xopenex, cromolyn spray, and fluticasone inhaler.
10. Anxiety: continue fluoxetine, hold trazodone, and start benzo per PCP.
11. FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, and start heart-healthy diet.

The patient's current medications include:

* Antibiotics: vancomycin, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone
* Vasodilators: morphine sulfate and nitroglycerin
* Anti-arrhythmics: amiodarone and nodal agents
* Antihypertensives: ASA and ACE-I
* Anticoagulants: coumadin (hold for now)
* Antihistamines: Benadryl (hold)
* Steroids: Flovent and corticosteroids (consider)
* Antidepressants: fluoxetine
* Anti-anxiety medications: benzo and trazodone (hold for now)

The patient's lab results show:

* Troponins: 0.86-1.16 ng/mL
* CK-MB: 17-26 IU/L
* LFTs: elevated ALT and AST
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* BUN: 506 mg/dL
* Sodium: <10 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics and vasodilators
* Monitor cardiac enzymes and LFTs
* Trend lactate and electrolytes
* Consider surgical consultation for colitis
* Restart Flovent and consider steroids for respiratory difficulties
* Continue antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications
* Hold ACE-I and diuretics until further evaluation
* Consider cardioversion and defibrillation if short-term return to baseline status

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement, with a possible transfer to the floor once stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis (though likely ischemic colitis rather
   than infectious)
        - D/c vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation (no stool yet)
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia; likely demand vs ACS
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Appreciate cards consult
   - Continue ASA 81mg PO; discontinue atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Consider anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Cards c/s: pt with likely AVNRT on admission,
   converted to VT, then back to NSR.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver. Now trending down.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Abdominal pain resolving; colitis
   likely ischemic. Surgery consulted, recommend continue resuscitation,
   enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - D/c abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   - CXR given decreased BS today, crackles, fluid +
   - Lasix 10mg IV x 1 and watch UOP
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis:
   - Change albuterol to xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;
   hold Benadryl
   - Restart flovent; consider steroids if continued respiratory
   difficulty
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now; start benzo per
   pcp
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, can start heart healthy
   diet, Folate. PPI.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - No o/n events, rested overnight on trazadone
   - cardiac enzymes, LFT trending down
   - urine culture <10K (non-speciated)
   - TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with apical akinesis. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (EF 30%), atrial fibrillation, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting. She presented with dyspnea and chest pain, was found to be hypotensive, and was cardioverted for atrial flutter. She developed ventricular tachycardia and was defibrillated, returning to normal sinus rhythm. The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including the administration of antibiotics, vasopressors, and anti-arrhythmic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is impaired, and she has developed tachyarrhythmias, which may exacerbate her cardiac condition.
2. Subacute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has prerenal azotemia, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and she has a history of cholecystectomy, which may have contributed to her liver dysfunction.
4. Abdominal pain and colitis: The patient has abdominal pain and colitis, which may be related to ischemic colitis or other gastrointestinal issues.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive lung disease and allergic rhinitis, which may exacerbate her respiratory symptoms.
7. Anxiety and depression: The patient is experiencing anxiety and depression, which may be exacerbated by her medical condition.
8. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance due to her medical condition and medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her medications as necessary.
2. Manage the patient's subacute renal failure by continuing gentle fluid boluses and monitoring her urine output.
3. Trend the patient's liver function tests and manage her hepatitis accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's abdominal pain and colitis with gentle enemas and empiric antibiotics.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy if necessary.
6. Adjust the patient's medications for obstructive lung disease and consider steroids if her respiratory symptoms persist.
7. Continue to manage the patient's anxiety and depression with therapy and medications as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance and adjust her medications accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Change albuterol to
   xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;  hold benadryl
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, can start heart healthy
   diet, Folate. PPI.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR DNI but consider less aggressive interventions such as
   cardiovert/defib if short-term return to baseline status (see OMR note

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents and amio.
   - PCP agrees that medical treatment most c/w goals of care rather than
   ICD; suggests starting benzo; consider cxr and if enlarging effusion or
   evidence fluid
   overload diuresing a bit; restart flovent and consider PO steroids if
   continues to
   have respiratory difficulties; If transferred to floor would appreciate
   consultation and
   comanagement both from general/chf cardiology and pulmonary; may
   benefit from SW visit at home
   - No o/n events, rested overnight on trazadone
   - cardiac enzymes, LFT trending down
   - urine culture <10K (non-speciated)
   - TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with apical akinesis. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CHF (ejection fraction 30%), Afib on coumadin, and s/p CABG. She presented with dyspnea and CP, was found to be hypotensive, and was cardioverted for atrial flutter, developing VTach, which was defibrillated, and returned to NSR. She was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and shock. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including CHF, NSTEMI, tachy-arrhythmia, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain/colitis, GIB, and obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Cardiogenic shock due to low ejection fraction and superimposed arrhythmia.
	* NSTEMI with elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior TWI on EKG.
	* Tachy-arrhythmia, including possible a-flutter and VTach, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
2. **Renal Complications:**
	* Subacute renal failure with creatinine 3.2, likely prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular depletion.
	* Risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, nephrotoxic medications, and underlying chronic kidney disease.
3. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Abdominal pain/colitis on CT, which may lead to further complications such as perforation, abscess, or sepsis.
	* GIB with guaiac-positive stools, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. **Hepatic Complications:**
	* Hepatitis with elevated LFTs, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis, which may worsen respiratory symptoms and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Risk of sepsis due to underlying comorbidities and potential sources of infection, such as colitis or GIB.
7. **Other Complications:**
	* Risk of falls due to hypotension, sedation, and underlying medical conditions.
	* Risk of electrolyte imbalances due to hypovolemia, diuretic use, and underlying medical conditions.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including troponins, CK-MB, and EKG.
2. Manage hypotension with fluid boluses and vasopressors as needed.
3. Continue empiric antibiotics for possible colitis and GIB.
4. Trend lactate and creatinine to monitor for signs of worsening kidney function.
5. Consider consults with cardiology, gastroenterology, and nephrology to optimize management of the patient's complex medical condition.
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and consider non-invasive ventilation or intubation if necessary.
7. Consider prophylaxis for pneumococcal disease and other potential infections."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents and amio.
   - PCP agrees that medical treatment most c/w goals of care rather than
   ICD; suggests starting benzo; consider cxr and if enlarging effusion or
   evidence fluid
   overload diuresing a bit; restart flovent and consider PO steroids if
   continues to
   have respiratory difficulties; If transferred to floor would appreciate
   consultation and
   comanagement both from general/chf cardiology and pulmonary; may
   benefit from SW visit at home
   - No o/n events, rested overnight on trazadone
   - cardiac enzymes, LFT trending down
   - urine culture <10K (non-speciated)
   - TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with apical akinesis. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation

   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes

   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea

   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Change albuterol to
   xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;  hold benadryl
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, can start heart healthy
   diet, Folate. PPI.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR DNI but consider less aggressive interventions such as
   cardiovert/defib if short-term return to baseline status (see OMR note
   [**5-12**] by PCP [**Doctor Last Name **] for full discussion)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation, who presented with dyspnea and chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive and was cardioverted for atrial flutter, which developed into ventricular tachycardia, and was defibrillated.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, or vasodilatory shock. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has a history of CHF, which increases the risk of cardiogenic shock. The patient's creatinine is elevated, which may indicate prerenal failure.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's elevated troponins and CK-MB suggest a possible NSTEMI. The patient's EKG shows anterior TWI, which is consistent with an NSTEMI.
3. Tachy-arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and developed ventricular tachycardia after cardioversion. She is being treated with amiodarone and is being monitored for further arrhythmias.
4. Subacute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and her urine electrolytes suggest a prerenal etiology. The patient's fluid status is being monitored, and she is receiving gentle fluid boluses.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may be due to shock liver or a primary liver disorder. The patient is being monitored for further elevation.
6. Abdominal pain/colitis: The patient has a history of cholecystectomy and has developed abdominal pain and colitis. She is being treated with empiric antibiotics and is being monitored for further development.
7. GIB: The patient's guaiac-positive stools suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. She is being monitored for further bleeding and is being treated with proton pump inhibitors.
8. CHF: The patient's cardiac function is impaired, and she is being treated with medications to manage her CHF.
9. Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: The patient has a history of obstructive lung disease and allergic rhinitis. She is being treated with medications to manage her symptoms.
10. Anxiety: The patient is being treated with fluoxetine for anxiety, but her trazodone is being held for now.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications need to be monitored and managed:

* Cardiogenic shock
* NSTEMI
* Tachy-arrhythmia
* Subacute renal failure
* Hepatitis
* Abdominal pain/colitis
* GIB
* CHF
* Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
* Anxiety

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Cardiogenic shock: Continue gentle fluid boluses, monitor UOP, and trend creatinine.
* NSTEMI: Continue atorvastatin, ASA, and manage CAD as above.
* Tachy-arrhythmia: Monitor on telemetry, continue amiodarone, and maintain K > 4 and Mg > 2.
* Subacute renal failure: Continue gentle fluid boluses, monitor UOP, and trend creatinine.
* Hepatitis: Trend LFTs, manage hypotension, and consider hepatitis viral panel.
* Abdominal pain/colitis: Continue empiric antibiotics, monitor for further development, and consider surgery consultation.
* GIB: Monitor for further bleeding, treat with proton pump inhibitors, and consider endoscopy.
* CHF: Manage with medications, monitor for further decompensation, and consider cardiac catheterization.
* Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Manage with medications, monitor for further exacerbation, and consider pulmonary consultation.
* Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine, monitor for further symptoms, and consider psychotherapy.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and she is being monitored for further development of potential medical complications."
