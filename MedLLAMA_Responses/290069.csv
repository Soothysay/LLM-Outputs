   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal
   given history of alchol abuse, in addition to emesis and diaphoresis
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x 1
   -- Midazolam for sedation, stop propofol
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, also sputum
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with NG tube and recent severe facial edema
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, anticipate frequent
   treatments
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal
   given history of alchol abuse, in addition to emesis and diaphoresis
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x 1
   -- Midazolam for sedation, stop propofol
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, also sputum
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with NG tube and recent severe facial edema
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, anticipate frequent
   treatments
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male who was found down by family members and has a history of polysubstance abuse. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for airway protection.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypertension and tachycardia, which are concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal.
2. Coma, which is multifactorial and may be related to multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness.
3. Strokes, which are concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic shower.
4. Rhabdomyolysis, which is complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) and is improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis.
5. Infection, which may be related to bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection.
6. Acute renal failure, which is being treated with dialysis.
7. Facial edema, which is concerning for angioedema.
8. Liver failure, which is unclear whether it is related to muscle breakdown or shock liver.
9. Coagulopathy, which is likely secondary to liver dysfunction.
10. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome, which has been treated with fasciotomy.
11. ETOH withdrawal, which is being treated with IV Valium and midazolam.
12. NSTEMI, which is likely related to coronary spasm from cocaine intoxication.
13. Positive UTI, which is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including propofol, fentanyl, lorazepam, and vancomycin. He is also receiving aggressive dialysis and hydration for his rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes (ALT and AST). His blood cultures are positive for Gram-positive cocci, and his urine culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci as well.

The patient's physical examination shows a sedated and intubated patient with improved facial edema and erythema. His cardiovascular examination is regular, and his lungs are clear. His abdominal examination is firm and non-tender, and his neurologic examination is not assessed due to his sedation and intubation.

The patient's plan includes continued treatment for his medical complications, including antibiotics, dialysis, and supportive care. His code status is full code, and his disposition is unclear at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual who was found down and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), hemorrhagic, renal failure, acute liver function abnormalities, rhabdomyolysis, and alcohol abuse.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% and their heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol, fentanyl, and lorazepam. They have also been receiving tube feeds and have had a high-residual volume, which led to aspiration and suctioning of 700cc.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function, elevated troponin-T, and acute kidney injury. Their complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 10.3, hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 90.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their condition, but they are not responsive and do not have palpable peripheral pulses.

The patient's diagnosis includes CVA, hemorrhagic, renal failure, acute liver function abnormalities, rhabdomyolysis, and possible compartment syndrome. The patient is at risk for developing medical complications such as bacteremia, stress ulcer, and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's bacteremia and high-residual volume, they are at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases their risk for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T is elevated, which suggests cardiac injury. They are also at risk for developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury is a concern, and they may require dialysis to manage their renal function.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and they are at risk for developing liver failure.
6. Compartment syndrome: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and elevated troponin-T suggest the possibility of compartment syndrome, which can lead to muscle necrosis and other complications.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis is in place, but they are still at risk for developing stress ulcers due to their critical condition.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobility and presence of central venous catheters increase their risk for developing deep vein thrombosis."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   .
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- On scheduled ativan for withdrawal prophylaxis
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   .
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   .
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis.
   .
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver failure
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   .
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 2 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   .
   #. ETOH withdrawal: has hx of ETOH withdrawl seizures
   -- Scheduled ativan 2mg IV Q6H as CIWA cant be measured now.
   .
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   .
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx: unnecessary given INR of 2.5
   -VAP ppx: mouth care, HOB elevation, IV H2 blocker

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- On scheduled ativan for withdrawal prophylaxis
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   .
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   .
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis.
   .
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver failure
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   .
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 2 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, including ethanol, IV heroin, and crack/cocaine, who was found down by family members. He has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, and the assessment suggests a multifactorial etiology, including multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including intubation, dialysis, and fasciotomy for compartment syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis with septic emboli: Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use, there is a concern for endocarditis with septic emboli.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of cocaine use suggest the possibility of a myocardial infarction.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and history of polysubstance abuse suggest the possibility of rhabdomyolysis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of polysubstance abuse suggest the possibility of acute renal failure.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and LDH) suggest the possibility of liver failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and history of liver failure suggest the possibility of coagulopathy.
7. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and fasciotomy suggest the possibility of ongoing compartment syndrome.
8. Bacteremia: The patient's positive urine culture and history of intravenous drug use suggest the possibility of bacteremia.
9. VAP: The patient's history of intubation and mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. DVT: The patient's history of intravenous drug use and prolonged immobility suggest the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive dialysis to manage acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
2. Monitor liver enzymes and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
3. Continue coagulation prophylaxis to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Monitor for signs of compartment syndrome and consider further surgical intervention if necessary.
5. Continue antibiotics for bacteremia and VAP.
6. Consider aspirin for NSTEMI.
7. Monitor for signs of sepsis and consider further evaluation if necessary.
8. Continue to manage glycemic control and consider insulin therapy if necessary.
9. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and consider further evaluation if necessary.
10. Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis and consider further evaluation if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal
   given history of alchol abuse, in addition to emesis and diaphoresis
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x 1
   -- Midazolam for sedation, stop propofol
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, also sputum
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with NG tube and recent severe facial edema
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal
   given history of alchol abuse, in addition to emesis and diaphoresis
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x 1
   -- Midazolam for sedation, stop propofol
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, also sputum
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with NG tube and recent severe facial edema
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, anticipate frequent
   treatments
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, including ethanol, IV heroin, crack/cocaine, and amphetamine use. He was found down by family members and is currently intubated for airway protection.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Hypertension and tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal, given his history of alcohol abuse.
2. Coma: Multifactorial, likely due to multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness.
3. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic shower.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: Complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis.
5. Infection: Bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection (UTI) are all possible sources of infection.
6. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, anticipating frequent treatments.
7. Facial edema: Concerning for angioedema, possibly secondary to gross overload from aggressive hydration for rhabdomyolysis.
8. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST/LDH). Suspect element of shock liver as well.
9. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver dysfunction.
10. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now postoperative day (POD) 3, with a fasciotomy performed in the operating room.
11. ETOH withdrawal: Concerning for acute withdrawal syndrome.
12. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from peak of 1.92 shortly after admission, likely due to coronary spasm and cocaine intoxication.
13. Positive UTI: GPC, for now, continue vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's bacteremia and UTI, there is a high risk of developing septic shock.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cocaine use and recent NSTEMI increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and ongoing sepsis may worsen his renal function.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure and ongoing sepsis may lead to worsening hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's multiple sources of infection increase the risk of developing infection-related complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI.
7. Coagulopathy-related bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or surgery.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of polysubstance abuse and recent strokes may lead to ongoing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status to address these potential complications and optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with large doses of benzos
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation today
   -- Discontinue Midzolam, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   -- Avoid pure beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use, if ongoing
   would use Labetalol IV
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin, needs redosing today given low trough
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 5,000
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Facial Edema: Resolved, not consistent with angioedema
   -- D/C Benadryl
   -- suspect edema was secondary to gross overload from agressive
   hydration for rhabdo
   -- Would
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to transient liver disfunction, now
   improved
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP for procedures given uremic platelets
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Would re advance tube feeds after BM, continue lactulose and
   PR laxatives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, including ethanol, IV heroin, crack/cocaine, and amphetamine use. He was found down by family members and is presenting with altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Hypertension and tachycardia, which are concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal and are being treated with benzodiazepines.
2. Coma, which is multifactorial and may be related to multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness.
3. Infection, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection, which are being treated with antibiotics.
4. Acute renal failure, which has been treated with dialysis and is being managed with tunneled renal access.
5. Strokes, which are concerning for embolic phenomena and are being monitored.
6. Rhabdomyolysis, which has improved significantly with aggressive hydration and dialysis.
7. Facial edema, which has resolved and is not consistent with angioedema.
8. Liver failure, which is improving and may be related to muscle breakdown or shock liver.
9. Coagulopathy, which is likely secondary to transient liver dysfunction and is being managed with FFP and ddAVP.
10. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome, which has been treated with fasciotomy and is being monitored.
11. ETOH withdrawal, which is being managed with benzodiazepines.
12. Intubation, which is for airway protection and is being monitored.
13. NSTEMI, which is likely related to coronary spasm and cocaine intoxication and is being managed with serial ECGs.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 11.7-14.8 K/uL
* Hct: 38.3-33.4%
* Plt: 71-76 K/uL
* Cr: 6.3-7.8 mg/dL

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with
   improved with aggressive benzodiazepine tx
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x PRN
   -- Midazolam for sedation
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with
   improved with aggressive benzodiazepine tx
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x PRN
   -- Midazolam for sedation
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of IV drug use and is at risk for endocarditis with septic emboli. The patient's blood cultures showed growth of coag (+) Staph, and the sputum culture showed heavy growth of MSSA and strep pneumo. The patient also has aspiration pneumonia and sinusitis, which can lead to further complications.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are still elevated, and there is a risk of further muscle damage and kidney injury.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has already required dialysis and has a high risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and there is a risk of further liver damage and potential for liver failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.
6. Neurological Impairment: The patient's neurological status is uncertain, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and has a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given the patient's history of liver failure and coagulopathy.
10. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis, particularly given the patient's multiple infections and underlying medical conditions.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple medical conditions. This includes continued treatment of their infections, management of their renal and liver failure, and close monitoring of their neurological and cardiovascular status. The patient's code status should be reassessed regularly to ensure that it is still appropriate."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), renal failure, liver function abnormalities, rhabdomyolysis, and compartment syndrome. They have a history of alcohol abuse and are currently experiencing acute myocardial infarction (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI) and bacteremia. The patient is being treated in the ICU with a dialysis catheter, nutritional support, and glycemic control. They are on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode and have a tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the presence of bacteremia, there is a high risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is already compromised, and further kidney injury can exacerbate their condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and further deterioration can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's AMI and bacteremia increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function abnormalities can lead to liver failure, which can further compromise their condition.
6. Rhabdomyolysis-Associated Complications: The patient's rhabdomyolysis can lead to compartment syndrome, which can cause further tissue damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Infection Control Issues: The patient's bacteremia and history of alcohol abuse increase the risk of infection control issues, such as VAP and DVT.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and further malnutrition can exacerbate their condition.
9. Glycemic Control Issues: The patient's glycemic control is critical, and any deviations from the target range can lead to complications.
10. Medication-Related Complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and any medication-related complications can further compromise their condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with large doses of benzos
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation today
   -- Discontinue Midzolam, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   -- Avoid pure beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use, if ongoing
   would use Labetalol IV
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin, needs redosing today given low trough
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 5,000
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with large doses of benzos
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation today
   -- Discontinue Midzolam, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   -- Avoid pure beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use, if ongoing
   would use Labetalol IV
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin, needs redosing today given low trough
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 5,000
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, including ethanol, IV heroin, and crack/cocaine, who presented with altered mental status after being found down by family members. He has multiple medical complications, including:

* Hypertension and tachycardia, likely due to acute alcohol withdrawal
* Coma, likely due to multifactorial causes including polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness
* Infection, with bacteremia and aspiration pneumonia, and possible sinusitis and urinary tract infection
* Acute renal failure, requiring dialysis
* Strokes, with a concerning distribution for embolic phenomena
* Rhabdomyolysis, improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis
* Liver failure, with improving LFTs
* Left upper extremity compartment syndrome, managed with fasciotomy and vacuum dressing
* ETOH withdrawal, requiring prophylaxis

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis with septic emboli due to intravenous drug use (IVDU)
2. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and possible underlying lung disease
3. Sepsis and multi-organ failure due to bacteremia and infection
4. Further stroke or neurologic impairment due to embolic phenomena
5. Worsening liver failure and potential hepatic encephalopathy
6. Complications of dialysis, including bleeding and infection
7. Further compartment syndrome or soft tissue damage due to left upper extremity trauma
8. Angioedema or anaphylaxis due to antibiotic use
9. Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders due to liver and kidney dysfunction
10. Potential for further cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and medication use."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with large doses of benzos
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation today
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   -- Start Labetalol PO 100mg TID, uptitrate as necessary
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Would D/C  vancomycin,
   -- Continue Unasyn IV x 14 day course
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Unasyn should cover as well.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- F/U Renal recs re: phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 5,000
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could try RSBI
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with altered mental status, hypertension, and tachycardia. He has undergone multiple procedures, including dialysis, fasciotomy, and intubation. His medical conditions include acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, and potential stroke. He has a diagnosis of bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, and sinusitis. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, and sinusitis. These infections can worsen his condition, leading to sepsis, organ failure, and increased mortality.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further decline in renal function, electrolyte imbalance, and fluid overload.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate, leading to coagulopathy, bleeding, and increased risk of infection.
4. Stroke: The patient's stroke may worsen, leading to increased risk of cerebral edema, herniation, and death.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis may worsen, leading to further muscle damage, electrolyte imbalance, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to increased risk of respiratory failure, pneumonia, and death.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension, tachycardia, and potential cardiac arrhythmias may worsen, leading to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and death.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's liver failure and potential gut dysfunction may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's stroke and potential neurological impairment may worsen, leading to increased risk of seizures, cerebral edema, and death.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Continue Labetalol 100mg PO BID
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern, given spike after
   stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum culture positive for Strep pneumo,
   sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- Renal recommended agains a phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 3,500
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

Summary:

The patient, a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU due to altered mental status after being found down by family members. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, tachycardia, coma, infection, acute renal failure, strokes, rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, and left upper extremity compartment syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.6°F
* Heart rate: 93 bpm
* Blood pressure: 120/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient has been receiving various medications, including:

* Vancomycin for infection
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Propofol for sedation
* Heparin for prophylaxis
* Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Labetalol for hypertension
* Nutren Renal for nutrition

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 71 K/uL
* Creatinine: 7.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 129 mg/dL
* Glucose: 134 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.10 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 637 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for MSSA, which could lead to bacteremia and sepsis.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event, which could lead to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Sinusitis: The patient's sputum culture is positive for Strep pneumo, which could indicate sinusitis.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine culture is positive for MSSA, which could indicate a urinary tract infection.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which could indicate acute kidney injury.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level is elevated, which could indicate rhabdomyolysis.
7. Liver failure: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, which could indicate liver failure.
8. Compartment syndrome: The patient has a left upper extremity compartment syndrome, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is crucial to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Continue Labetalol 100mg PO TID
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern, given spike after
   stopping Vancomycin, would restart this
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to sensitive coag
   (+) Staph.
   -- Would restart  vancomycin,
   -- Continue Unasyn IV x 14 day course
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube now
   -- Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Unasyn should cover as well.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- F/U Renal recs re: phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 3,500
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could try RSBI
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypertension, and tachycardia. He has undergone multiple interventions, including intubation, sedation, and hemodialysis. Laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and liver failure. Imaging studies show multiple embolic strokes, and cultures reveal GPC's in blood and urine, speciated to sensitive coag (+) Staph.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's multiple sources of infection, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection, require continued treatment with antibiotics and close monitoring.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires continued hemodialysis and close monitoring of renal function.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis has improved, but it is essential to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure requires continued monitoring of liver function tests and treatment of any underlying causes.
5. Strokes: The patient's embolic strokes require close monitoring for any signs of worsening or new neurological deficits.
6. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's left upper extremity compartment syndrome requires continued monitoring and treatment to prevent further damage.
7. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient's ETOH withdrawal requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications.
8. Intubation: The patient's intubation requires close monitoring for any signs of respiratory failure or complications.
9. Neurological Impairment: The patient's neurological impairment requires close monitoring for any signs of worsening or new neurological deficits.
10. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for the patient's multiple sources of infection.
2. Continue hemodialysis and close monitoring of renal function.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and treat any underlying causes of liver failure.
4. Continue monitoring the patient's neurological status and treat any signs of worsening or new neurological deficits.
5. Continue monitoring the patient's compartment syndrome and treat any signs of further damage.
6. Monitor the patient's ETOH withdrawal and treat any signs of complications.
7. Continue monitoring the patient's intubation and treat any signs of respiratory failure or complications.
8. Consider weaning the patient from sedation and intubation if they show signs of improvement.
9. Consider initiating a rehabilitation program to help the patient recover from their neurological impairment.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic instability and treat any signs of further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of CVA (stroke), hemorrhagic, and renal failure. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, and their condition has been stable. However, the patient continues to experience fever, with a temperature of 102.6°F. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating ongoing renal failure and liver dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out sepsis and prevent its progression.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating ongoing renal failure. This may require further treatment, such as dialysis, to manage the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating liver dysfunction. This may be related to the patient's underlying medical condition or secondary to the treatment.
4. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase, indicating the possibility of compartment syndrome. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out compartment syndrome and prevent its progression.
5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's electrocardiogram shows signs of myocardial infarction, indicating the possibility of a cardiac event. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out myocardial infarction and prevent its progression.
6. Bacteremia: The patient's blood culture is positive, indicating the possibility of bacteremia. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out bacteremia and prevent its progression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely.
2. Consider further evaluation and treatment for sepsis, renal failure, liver dysfunction, compartment syndrome, myocardial infarction, and bacteremia.
3. Adjust the patient's treatment plan as necessary to manage their condition and prevent complications.
4. Consider consulting with a nephrologist and/or a cardiologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's renal and cardiac function.
5. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to manage their condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Continue Labetalol 100mg PO BID
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern, given spike after
   stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum culture positive for Strep pneumo,
   sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- Renal recommended agains a phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 3,500
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family members. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia: Improved with treatment.
2. Coma: Multifactorial, caused by embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness.
3. Infection: Bacteremia (MSSA), aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection.
4. Acute Renal Failure: Permanent catheter placed, and hemodialysis (HD) planned.
5. Strokes: Embolic phenomena with embolic shower, no heparin drip at this time.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis.
7. Liver Failure: Improving, unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to liver function tests (LFTs).
8. Left Upper Extremity Compartment Syndrome: Fasciotomy performed in the OR, with a vacuum dressing in place.
9. ETOH Withdrawal: Being monitored.
10. Intubation: For airway protection, with plans to wean to pressure support (PS) and potentially attempt extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: Bacteremia and aspiration pneumonia can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection.
2. Respiratory failure: Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: Tachycardia and hypertension can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
4. Renal failure: Acute kidney injury (AKI) can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. Stroke: Embolic phenomena can lead to further strokes, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality.
6. Liver failure: Prolonged liver dysfunction can lead to multi-organ failure, which can be fatal.
7. Septic shock: Sepsis can progress to septic shock, a life-threatening condition characterized by hypotension, organ dysfunction, and high mortality.
8. Neurological impairment: Stroke and rhabdomyolysis can lead to permanent neurological damage, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality.
9. Infection: Aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection can lead to further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
10. Complications from intubation: Intubation can lead to complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), pneumothorax, and tracheal stenosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. He was also
   growing MSSA in blood and MSSA/strep pneumo in sputum cultures. Also
   concerned about RIJ central line as a source of infection since he is
   spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics. He was started on Levaquin
   yesterday given strep pneumo in sputum.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Zosyn
   - f/u cultures
   - d/c RIJ once adequate PIVs are placed; send tip for culture
   2) Respiratory: Patient maintaining excellent oxygen saturations on
   CPAP + PS with good RSBI.
   - Extubate today
   3) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   4)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology reccs
   5) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed on Thursday with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD
   yesterday. Cr slowly coming down.
   -- No HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   6) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   7) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   8) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. He was also
   growing MSSA in blood and MSSA/strep pneumo in sputum cultures. Also
   concerned about RIJ central line as a source of infection since he is
   spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics. He was started on Levaquin
   yesterday given strep pneumo in sputum.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Zosyn
   - f/u cultures
   - d/c RIJ once adequate PIVs are placed; send tip for culture
   2) Respiratory: Patient maintaining excellent oxygen saturations on
   CPAP + PS with good RSBI.
   - Extubate today
   3) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   4)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology reccs
   5) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed on Thursday with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD
   yesterday. Cr slowly coming down.
   -- No HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   6) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   7) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   8) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. Several sources
   are of concern, given spike after stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum
   culture positive for Strep pneumo, sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed on Thursday with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD
   yesterday. Cr slowly coming down.
   -- No HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   #. Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. Several sources
   are of concern, given spike after stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum
   culture positive for Strep pneumo, sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed on Thursday with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD
   yesterday. Cr slowly coming down.
   -- No HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   #. Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who is currently intubated in the ICU due to altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including:

1. Infection:
	* Urine and sputum cultures growing Gram-Negative Rods (GNRs).
	* Sputum culture positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to Levofloxacin.
	* Blood cultures positive for Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia:
	* Improved with increased Labetolol and Ativan.
3. Coma:
	* Multifactorial, possibly due to multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness.
	* Intubated for airway protection, sedation changed to Propofol.
4. Acute Renal Failure:
	* Permanent catheter placed, creatinine remains elevated, but slowly improving.
	* Received hemodialysis (HD) yesterday, no HD planned for today.
5. Strokes:
	* Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic shower.
	* No heparin drip at this time, follow-up neurology recommendations.
6. Rhabdomyolysis:
	* Complicated by Acute Renal Failure (ARF), improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis.
	* CK levels significantly improved, continue to follow daily.
7. Liver Failure:
	* Improving each day, follow daily liver function tests (LFTs).
8. Left Upper Extremity Compartment Syndrome:
	* Initially underwent fasciotomy on admission, wound vac in place.
	* Wound vac dressing planned for tomorrow, follow-up orthopedic recommendations.
9. Intubation:
	* For airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
	* Wean to partial support (PS) today, possible extubation if more awake.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the presence of multiple sources of infection, including urinary tract infection, aspiration pneumonia, and bacteremia.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Due to the patient's respiratory support and potential for lung injury.
3. Cardiac Arrest: Given the patient's tachycardia and hypertension, as well as the potential for cardiac complications from embolic strokes.
4. Renal Failure: Despite improving creatinine levels, the patient remains at risk for further renal damage or failure.
5. Neurological Complications: Given the patient's multiple embolic strokes and potential for further neurological damage.
6. Wound Complications: The patient's left upper extremity compartment syndrome and wound vac in place may increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
7. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy and ongoing liver failure may increase the risk of further hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Metabolic Derangements: The patient's multiple medical conditions and medications may lead to metabolic derangements, such as electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Continue Labetalol 100mg PO BID
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern, given spike after
   stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum culture positive for Strep pneumo,
   sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- Renal recommended agains a phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 3,500
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. He was also
   growing MSSA in blood and MSSA/strep pneumo in sputum cultures. Also
   concerned about RIJ central line as a source of infection since he is
   spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics. He was started on Levaquin
   yesterday given strep pneumo in sputum.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Zosyn
   - f/u cultures
   - d/c RIJ once adequate PIVs are placed; send tip for culture
   3) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   4)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology reccs
   5) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   6) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   7) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   8) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. He was also
   growing MSSA in blood and MSSA/strep pneumo in sputum cultures. Also
   concerned about RIJ central line as a source of infection since he is
   spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics. He was started on Levaquin
   yesterday given strep pneumo in sputum.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Zosyn
   - f/u cultures
   - d/c RIJ once adequate PIVs are placed; send tip for culture
   3) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   4)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology reccs
   5) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   6) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   7) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   8) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs

Summary:

The patient, a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status after being found down by family members. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated but was successfully extubated today with no difficulties. He has a fever of 101.2°F and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections, including urinary tract infections and pneumonia. His laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, indicating acute kidney injury. He has a history of rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, and compartment syndrome in his left upper extremity. He is receiving dialysis and has undergone fasciotomy and wound vacuum therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels indicate AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of further interventions, such as dialysis, may be necessary.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase level suggests ongoing rhabdomyolysis. Close monitoring of muscle enzymes and consideration of further interventions, such as aggressive hydration and dialysis, may be necessary.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest liver failure. Close monitoring of liver function and consideration of further interventions, such as liver transplantation, may be necessary.
5. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's left upper extremity compartment syndrome may require ongoing monitoring and consideration of further interventions, such as fasciotomy and wound vacuum therapy.
6. Wound Infection: The patient's wound may be at risk for infection due to his compromised immune system and ongoing antibiotic use. Close monitoring of wound healing and consideration of further interventions, such as wound debridement and antibiotics, may be necessary.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum cultures growing GNRs and MSSA suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and consideration of further interventions, such as antibiotics and mechanical ventilation, may be necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient is extubated and receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 161/73 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's blood cultures have grown MSSA, and the sputum cultures have shown heavy growth of MSSA and PCN-resistant strep pneumo. The patient's WBC count is elevated at 11.6, and the platelet count is low at 77.

The patient's medical history is significant for CVA, hemorrhagic, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, rhabdomyolysis, alcohol abuse, myocardial infarction, and bacteremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated WBC count put them at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure and rhabdomyolysis increase their risk for developing AKI.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function abnormalities may progress to liver failure if not managed promptly.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and elevated troponin-T levels increase their risk for developing another myocardial infarction.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and they may require reintubation if their oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase.
6. Infection: The patient's multiple lines and tubes increase their risk for developing infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Compartment syndrome: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and renal failure increase their risk for developing compartment syndrome.

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing their underlying medical conditions, preventing complications, and providing supportive care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 102.2 kg male who was admitted with a chief complaint of CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), hemorrhagic. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

1. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating worsening renal function.
2. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, and T Bili) are elevated, indicating liver dysfunction.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's muscle enzymes (CK, CKMB) are elevated, indicating muscle damage.
4. Compartment syndrome: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the differential shows a high percentage of neutrophils, indicating an inflammatory response.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Levofloxacin, and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn), indicating a potential bacterial infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure of 161/73 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and his oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 11.6
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 77
* Creatinine: 7.3
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25.8 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 637 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 5.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are pending, and his microbiology results are unknown.

The patient's medical history is significant for CVA, hemorrhagic, and alcohol abuse. The patient's family history is significant for MI and stroke.

The patient's current medications include:

* Labetolol (100mg TID)
* Fentanyl (12.5 x 1)
* Famotidine (Pepcid) (08:30 AM)
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) (04:29 AM)

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Adjustment of medications as needed
* Further evaluation of the patient's liver and renal function
* Consideration of dialysis or hemofiltration for renal failure
* Further evaluation of the patient's bacteremia and potential source of infection

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening renal failure and need for dialysis
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Further liver dysfunction and potential need for liver transplantation
* Complications related to rhabdomyolysis, such as muscle necrosis and myoglobinuria
* Potential for further cardiac complications, such as MI or arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection:  Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the
   sputum, GNRs in the urine.  Persistently febrile on vanc, zosyn,
   levofloxacin.
   -Can continue current coverage for now, for HAP and UTI.  Can take
   vancomycin off, as there is no MRSA identified.
   -F/u cultures
   -change foley
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Titrate labetalol after dialysis
   -- Ativan prn
   3)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology recs
   4) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal recs
   5) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation, continue to monitor CK
   daily
   6) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   7) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- To OR tomorrow for repeat debridement
   -- wound vac in place

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection:  Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the
   sputum, GNRs in the urine.  Persistently febrile on vanc, zosyn,
   levofloxacin.
   -Can continue current coverage for now, for HAP and UTI.  Can take
   vancomycin off, as there is no MRSA identified.
   -F/u cultures
   -change foley
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Titrate labetalol after dialysis
   -- Ativan prn
   3)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology recs
   4) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal recs
   5) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation, continue to monitor CK
   daily
   6) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   7) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- To OR tomorrow for repeat debridement
   -- wound vac in place

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient was extubated with no difficulties and is currently receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy with a FiO2 of 40%.
* The patient has a fever of 101.2°F (38.4°C) and has been persistently febrile despite being on vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin.
* The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, including ethanol, IV heroin, and crack/cocaine, and is currently experiencing possible withdrawal symptoms.
* The patient has acute renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis.
* The patient has rhabdomyolysis, with a CK level of ~40,000 at presentation, and is being monitored daily.
* The patient has liver failure, with improving LFTs each day.
* The patient has a left upper extremity compartment syndrome, which was initially treated with fasciotomy and is now being managed with a wound vac.
* The patient has a history of multiple strokes, which are confirmed by MRI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the persistent fever and potential infections, including Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo.
* Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease due to the ongoing hemodialysis and potential nephrotoxic effects of certain medications.
* Rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
* Liver failure worsening or development of liver-related complications, such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy.
* Complications related to the left upper extremity compartment syndrome, such as nerve damage or infection.
* Neurological complications related to the multiple strokes, including seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or brain edema.
* Withdrawal symptoms due to the polysubstance abuse, including ethanol, IV heroin, and crack/cocaine.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment plans as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with altered mental status, hypertension, tachycardia, and multiple organ dysfunction. He has been admitted to the ICU for treatment of Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the sputum, Pseudomonas in the urine, and acute renal failure. He has received treatment with antibiotics, including Amikacin for Pseudomonas and Levofloxacin for MSSA. He also has hypertension, tachycardia, and liver failure, and is at risk for ETOH withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to his compromised immune system and the presence of Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in his sputum.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of polysubstance abuse increase his risk for neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are elevated, indicating rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to muscle damage, kidney damage, and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, jaundice, and encephalopathy.
7. Left Upper Extremity Compartment Syndrome: The patient's compartment syndrome is at risk for further complications, such as necrosis, gangrene, and sepsis.
8. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for ETOH withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection:  Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the
   sputum, Pseudomonas in the urine.
   -- Started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas, dosed at 70% of 5mg/Kg of IBW
   (70 inches ~ 70 Kg), with load of 600mg
   -- Levofloxacing for MSSA, serratia species from sputum
   -- Stopped vanc, zosyn
   -- F/u cultures
   -- change foley
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Titrate labetalol after dialysis
   -- Ativan prn
   3)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose once able to take PO's
   -- Neurology recs
   4) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal recs
   5) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation, continue to monitor CK
   daily
   6) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   7) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- S/P repeat debridement
   -- wound vac in place
   -- Patient will need skin graft, not urgent, can be done once medically
   stable.

The patient has a history of multiple strokes, polysubstance abuse, and possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including:

* Infection: Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the sputum, Pseudomonas in the urine.
* Hypertension/Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
* Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI confirms multiple strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
* Acute Renal Failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no complications. Creatinine remains elevated.
* Rhabdomyolysis: CK levels have improved from 40,000 to 637 IU/L.
* Liver Failure: Improving each day, with daily LFTs.
* Left Upper Extremity Compartment Syndrome: Initially underwent fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and sedatives. The patient is also undergoing dialysis and has a central venous catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Infection: The patient's infection is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.
* Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration or complications.
* Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy.
* Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to further complications, such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Hepatic Complications: The patient's liver failure may lead to further complications, such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy.
* Pulmonary Complications: The patient's respiratory status is uncertain, and there is a risk of further complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."
