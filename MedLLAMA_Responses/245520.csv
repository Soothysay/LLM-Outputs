Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/27 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, with an ABG report of ///28/. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient has a diagnosis of impaired skin integrity, hypotension, heart failure, pain control issues, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and increased creatinine levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure could worsen, leading to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia could progress, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
4. Skin Integrity Issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity could lead to further complications, such as infection, necrosis, or delayed healing.
5. Pain Control Issues: The patient's chronic pain and acute pain could lead to increased risk of medication overdose, tolerance, or withdrawal, which could negatively impact their overall health.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or further complications.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutrition is not well-documented, which could lead to malnutrition, weakness, and decreased immune function.
9. Glycemic Control Issues: The patient's glucose levels are not well-controlled, which could lead to hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or ketoacidosis.
10. Infection Control: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly given their impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, and invasive lines."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 F with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension in the
   setting of pna and underlying lung disease and CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Acute on chronic
   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. No history of COPD but given chronicity and
   smoking Hx as well as wheezes, this could have remained undiagnosed
   - cont pna treatment
   - o2 to 89-93%
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension
   - possible intubation if NIPV fails
   .
   # Hypotension: hx of diarrhea, current pna, worsening renal function,
   most likely prerenal due to volume los, doubt flourid sepsis
   cardiogenic
   - fluid bolus prn
   - possible transfusion as MDS
   - no need for pressors currently but if no response to fluid will need
   line and sepsis treatment, also given CHF low treshold for central line
   to also asses cvp
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Patcont [**Doctor Last Name **]/Zosyn. follow up culture, doubt current need
   for double coverage, CxR could be concerning for empyema. but good
   breath sound with crackel in lowel l lung field therefore probably just
   consolidation, if no improvement could consider CT to eval for empyema
   and possible tap. on chronic prednisone w.o pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. CxR no suggestive
   of PCP and LDH not much high. consider pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
   .
   # distolic CHF: mostly right ventricular failure per echo: good
   systolic function. BNP on admission significantly improved to past
   ruling out exacerbation.
   - gentle fluid resuscitation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  somnolent but arousable. not focal but
   difficult to assess as poor cooperation language barrier.
   most likely due to hypercarbia, with decrease co2 expect improvment
   - recheck abg and possible NIPV
   # DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox
   at home. doubt massive pe to be the cause of hypotension.
   -cont lovenox
   .
   # CRI: acute on chronic. Prerenal vs ATn in the setting of hypotension
   - renal lytes
   - follow UOP
   - fluid IV keep MAP>60
   - renaly dose meds
   .
   # MDS:  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 54**].  Has received multiple
   blood transfusions in past. Current HCT drop still at range of
   baseline, no source of bleed, although need careful monitoring as on
   lovenox with renal impairment
   # may need transfusion
   # recheck in pm
   .
   # Code: DNR/ but ok to intubate-  Multiple discussion were had with the
   patient and her daughter throughout on last hospitalization regarding
   goals of care and prognosis. During transport of patient discussion

   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Acute on chronic
   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. No history of COPD but given chronicity and
   smoking Hx as well as wheezes, this could have remained undiagnosed
   - cont pna treatment
   - o2 to 89-93%
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension
   - possible intubation if NIPV fails

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, and chronic heart failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm (69-89 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/27 mmHg (43-115/56 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (23-36)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.1 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 27.9%
* Platelet count: 95 K/μL
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: 28 mEq/L (sodium), 5.6 mEq/L (potassium), 41 mg/dL (phosphorus), 99 mEq/L (calcium)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Continue pneumonia treatment, oxygen therapy to 89-93%, standing nebulizers, non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary, and possible intubation if NIPV fails.
* Hypotension: Fluid bolus as needed, possible transfusion as the patient has myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and close monitoring for fluid sepsis and cardiogenic shock.
* Pneumonia: Continue antibiotics, follow-up culture, and consider computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for empyema and possible tap.
* Chronic heart failure: Gentle fluid resuscitation and close monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure.
* Altered mental status: Recheck arterial blood gas (ABG) and consider non-invasive pressure ventilation to improve hypercarbia.
* DVT and PE: Continue low-molecular-weight heparin (lovenox) and monitor for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
* MDS: Follow-up with the patient's primary care physician and monitor for signs of bleeding or worsening anemia.
* Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate) with the option to intubate if necessary.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or need for intubation.
* Cardiovascular complications: worsening heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal complications: worsening kidney function, acute kidney injury (AKI), or need for dialysis.
* Infections: worsening pneumonia, sepsis, or development of new infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Bleeding complications: worsening bleeding risk due to MDS, platelet dysfunction, or anticoagulation therapy.
* Neurological complications: worsening altered mental status, seizures, or stroke."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and underlying lung disease and CHF. She has a history of pneumonia, DVT/PE, and MDS. Currently, she is receiving oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and diuretics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can progress to empyema, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
4. DVT/PE: The patient's history of DVT/PE can increase the risk of recurrent thromboembolic events, particularly if she is not receiving adequate anticoagulation therapy.
5. MDS: The patient's MDS can worsen, leading to increased bleeding risk, infections, and organ dysfunction.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac failure can worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
8. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and other underlying conditions can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
9. Infections: The patient's underlying conditions can increase the risk of infections, particularly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutrition can lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her underlying conditions and increase the risk of complications.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring, aggressive treatment of her underlying conditions, and careful management of her medications and fluids."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   81 F with resolving hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension in
   the setting of resolving pna and underlying lung disease and CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure/ PNA: Acute on chronic
   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. Patient is on home O2 of 2L for CHF.
   - cont pna treatment with vanco zosyn, started [**3-24**], will continue to
   [**4-1**] to complete 8d course of non-pseudonomal HAP
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension, although weaning down O2 to 4L overnight
   - DNR/DNI
   .
   # Hypotension: hx of diarrhea, current pna, worsening renal function,
   most likely prerenal due to volume los, doubt flourid sepsis
   cardiogenic. Patient has low baseline around SBP 100 and has good urine
   output currently.
   - fluid bolus prn, will give trials of 250 cc boluses to check
   - possible transfusion as MDS
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 5.6 this am, likely from renal failure,
   - pt refusing [**Month/Day (4) 8223**], daughter consulted and also refused
   - talked about dangers of not treating hyperkalemia but still refusing.
   - will cons
   .
   # distolic CHF: mostly right ventricular failure per echo: good
   systolic function. BNP on admission significantly improved to past
   ruling out exacerbation, likely fluid depleted on exam.
   - gentle fluid resuscitation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  somnolent but arousable. not focal but
   difficult to assess as poor cooperation language barrier.
   most likely due to hypercarbia, with decrease co2 expect improvment
   - improving today, more awake and alert
   # DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox
   at home. doubt massive pe to be the cause of hypotension.
   -cont lovenox, with renal failure will check factor 10a tomorrow at
   trough to get true level

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure, pneumonia, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/32 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy at 4 L/min and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening acute kidney injury (AKI), with a potassium level of 5.6 mmol/L, which is likely due to renal failure. The patient's daughter is refusing treatment for hyperkalemia, despite being aware of the risks.

The patient has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and is being managed with non-invasive pressure ventilation and oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs, right-sided cardiac failure, and gross bilateral edema. Her abdomen is soft and tender, with a positive bowel sound.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progression of acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD)
2. Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia
3. Worsening of respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to renal impairment and anticoagulation therapy
5. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to untreated pneumonia
6. Progression of DVT/PE to pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension
7. Increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression and chronic medical conditions
8. Development of gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and gastrointestinal ulcers
9. Increased risk of cardiac arrest due to hypotension and cardiac failure
10. Development of cognitive impairment or delirium due to underlying medical conditions and medications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a [**Name2 (NI) 8223**] who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hyperkalemia. The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, with continued hypotension, requiring boluses of fluids, and worsening ARF. The patient's potassium levels remain elevated at 5.6 mEq/L, and the family has refused to treat the hyperkalemia until the levels are higher. The patient's oxygen requirement remains steady at 4 L NC, and they require ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and worsening ARF increase their risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's hypotension and heart failure (CHF) increase their risk of cardiac arrest, particularly if their potassium levels continue to rise.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening ARF increases their risk of developing end-stage renal disease, which can lead to a range of complications, including electrolyte imbalances and anemia.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and requirement for oxygen may indicate a high risk of respiratory failure, particularly if their underlying pneumonia worsens.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and ongoing ICU care increase their risk of developing additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's hyperkalemia and heart failure (CHF) increase their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's ongoing hyperkalemia and worsening ARF increase their risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and worsening clinical status, it is essential to closely monitor their condition and adjust their care plan accordingly to prevent potential complications and improve their outcomes."

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, with a systolic blood pressure ranging from 75 to 116 mmHg, which is not responsive to boluses of fluid. The patient's potassium level is 5.6 mmol/L, which is elevated and not responding to treatment. The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is worsening, as evident from the progressive increase in creatinine levels.

The patient's respiratory status remains stable, with a steady oxygen requirement of 4 liters nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is first-degree atrioventricular block, which may be a concern.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of acute heart failure, including bilateral crackles in the lungs, and peripheral edema. The patient's abdomen is soft, with a positive bowel sound, indicating ongoing gut dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening AKI, electrolyte imbalances, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's first-degree atrioventricular block may progress to higher-grade blocks, leading to cardiac arrest.
2. Worsening heart failure: The patient's acute heart failure may progress to chronic heart failure, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased mortality.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and ongoing gut dysfunction may lead to sepsis, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of mortality.
4. Renal failure: The patient's worsening AKI may progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly the elevated potassium level, may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
6. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing gut dysfunction may increase the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infections.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.

In conclusion, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 F with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension in the
   setting of pna and underlying lung disease and CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Acute on chronic
   predominantly hypercarbic with good oxygenation currently, most likely
   percipitated by pna and ubtitration of oxygen on the floor over night
   (O2Sat 100%) leading to CO2 retension. No CNS active meds, doubt muscle
   weakness to be the cause as strong respiratory rate and obviouse deep
   inspiration on exam. No history of COPD but given chronicity and
   smoking Hx as well as wheezes, this could have remained undiagnosed
   - cont pna treatment with vanco zosyn, improving, no need to double
   coverage GNR
   - o2 to 89-93%
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension, although weaning down O2 to 4L overnight
   - DNI
   .
   # Hypotension: hx of diarrhea, current pna, worsening renal function,
   most likely prerenal due to volume los, doubt flourid sepsis
   cardiogenic
   - fluid bolus prn, will give trials of 250 cc boluses to check
   - possible transfusion as MDS
   - no need for pressors currently but if no response to fluid will need
   line and sepsis treatment, also given CHF low treshold for central line
   to also asses cvp
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Patcont [**Doctor Last Name **]/Zosyn. follow up culture, doubt current need
   for double coverage,
   - repeat CXRs
   - continue abx
   - fluid boluses PRN
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 5.6 this am, likely from renal failure,
   - pt refusing [**Doctor Last Name 8223**], daughter consulted and also refused
   - talked about dangers of not treating hyperkalemia but still refusing.
   .
   # distolic CHF: mostly right ventricular failure per echo: good
   systolic function. BNP on admission significantly improved to past
   ruling out exacerbation, likely fluid depleted on exam.
   - gentle fluid resuscitation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  somnolent but arousable. not focal but
   difficult to assess as poor cooperation language barrier.
   most likely due to hypercarbia, with decrease co2 expect improvment
   - improving today, more awake and alert
   # DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox
   at home. doubt massive pe to be the cause of hypotension.
   -cont lovenox, with renal failure will check factor 10a tomorrow at
   trough to get true level
   - pharmacy helping with dosing
   .
   # CRI: acute on chronic. Prerenal vs ATn in the setting of hypotension
   - continue fluid boluses
   - renal lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renaly dose meds
   .
   # MDS:  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 54**].  Has received multiple
   blood transfusions in past. Current HCT drop still at range of
   baseline, no source of bleed, although need careful monitoring as on
   lovenox with renal impairment
   - may need transfusion
   - recheck in pm

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   inspiration on exam. No history of COPD but given chronicity and
   smoking Hx as well as wheezes, this could have remained undiagnosed
   - cont pna treatment with vanco zosyn, improving, no need to double
   coverage GNR
   - o2 to 89-93%
   - standing nebs
   - non invasive pressure ventilation if worsening tachypnea, or CO2
   retension, although weaning down O2 to 4L overnight
   - DNI
   .
   # Hypotension: hx of diarrhea, current pna, worsening renal function,
   most likely prerenal due to volume los, doubt flourid sepsis
   cardiogenic
   - fluid bolus prn, will give trials of 250 cc boluses to check
   - possible transfusion as MDS
   - no need for pressors currently but if no response to fluid will need
   line and sepsis treatment, also given CHF low treshold for central line
   to also asses cvp
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Patcont [**Doctor Last Name **]/Zosyn. follow up culture, doubt current need
   for double coverage,
   - repeat CXRs
   - continue abx
   - fluid boluses PRN
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 5.6 this am, likely from renal failure,
   - pt refusing [**Doctor Last Name 8223**], daughter consulted and also refused
   - talked about dangers of not treating hyperkalemia but still refusing.
   .
   # distolic CHF: mostly right ventricular failure per echo: good
   systolic function. BNP on admission significantly improved to past
   ruling out exacerbation, likely fluid depleted on exam.
   - gentle fluid resuscitation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  somnolent but arousable. not focal but
   difficult to assess as poor cooperation language barrier.
   most likely due to hypercarbia, with decrease co2 expect improvment
   - improving today, more awake and alert
   # DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox
   at home. doubt massive pe to be the cause of hypotension.
   -cont lovenox, with renal failure will check factor 10a tomorrow at
   trough to get true level
   - pharmacy helping with dosing
   .
   # CRI: acute on chronic. Prerenal vs ATn in the setting of hypotension
   - continue fluid boluses
   - renal lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renaly dose meds
   .
   # MDS:  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 54**].  Has received multiple
   blood transfusions in past. Current HCT drop still at range of
   baseline, no source of bleed, although need careful monitoring as on
   lovenox with renal impairment
   - may need transfusion
   - recheck in pm

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic lung disease and CHF, currently in the ICU due to hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is receiving treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox at home.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 67 bpm
* Blood pressure: 88/32 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: moderate hypotension

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 17.1
* Hct: 27.9%
* Plt: 95
* Cr: 2.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.0/30.8/1.0, Differential-Neuts: 91.0%, Lymph: 5.6%, Mono: 2.7%, Eos: 0.6%, Ca++: 7.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Hyperkalemia
* Pneumonia
* Chronic lung disease and CHF
* DVT/PE
* MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome)
* Renal failure

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuous oxygen therapy
* Non-invasive pressure ventilation
* Fluid boluses
* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Lovenox for DVT/PE prophylaxis
* Renal lytes
* Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for MDS management
* Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and blood transfusions as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications due to CHF
* Sepsis
* Renal failure
* Bleeding complications due to MDS
* Thrombotic complications due to DVT/PE
* Hyperkalemia-related cardiac arrhythmias"
