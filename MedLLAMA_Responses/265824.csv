You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She has had recent myocardial infarctions and has been transferred to the ICU for revaluation of options for revascularization. She is currently on nitroglycerin and heparin infusions and is being monitored closely.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 114/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her physical examination is notable for a soft and non-tender abdomen, as well as normal pulmonary and cardiac exams.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 38.7 g/dL, platelet count of 115 K/uL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 159 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing aspirin and heparin infusions, weaning off nitroglycerin, and starting metoprolol at 25mg tid and titrating up dose. She will also undergo a repeat echocardiogram to confirm the measurement of high pulmonary artery pressure and severity of aortic stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and recent myocardial infarctions, there is a high risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recent myocardial infarctions increase her risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of delirium and confusion increases her risk of neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and cognitive decline.
4. Hematological complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of hepatitis C increase her risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling catheters increase her risk of infection, including sepsis, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia.
6. Renal complications: The patient's history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease increase her risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal disease and recent myocardial infarctions increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and delirium. She has been admitted to the ICU with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options. She is currently receiving nitroglycerin and heparin infusions and is being treated for cardiac complications, including CHF and atrial fibrillation. Her lab results show mild thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be secondary to hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history and recent MI make her at risk for further cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and heparin therapy increase her risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and hematoma.
3. Infection: The patient's delirium and cardiac catheterization increase her risk of infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support and cardiac condition increase her risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac condition and anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of neurological complications, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, and seizures.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cardiac condition and anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting.
7. Renal complications: The patient's cardiac condition and anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and dialysis dependence.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hepatitis C. She has recently experienced an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options.

The patient is currently being treated with IV heparin, nitroglycerin, and metoprolol, and is on aspirin and lisinopril. She has a history of delirium and confusion, and is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 38.7%
* Platelet count: 115 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1339 IU/L
* CK: 1339 IU/L
* CKMB: 1339 IU/L
* ALT: 118 IU/L
* AST: 349 IU/L
* Alk Phos: 95 IU/L
* T Bili: 0.7 mg/dL
* Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 67 bpm
* Blood pressure: 114/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Mild aortic stenosis with preserved A2 and good carotid upstrokes
* No chest pain
* No edema or rales

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* Cardiac failure, due to the patient's cardiomyopathy and reduced left ventricular function
* Thrombocytopenia, due to the patient's history of hepatitis C and recent cardiac event
* Infection, due to the patient's immunocompromised state and recent cardiac event
* Bleeding, due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy
* Renal failure, due to the patient's cardiomyopathy and reduced renal function

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue IV heparin and nitroglycerin
* Start metoprolol at 25mg tid and titrate up dose
* Obtain angiography film from the patient's recent cardiac catheterization
* Discuss with the patient's cardiologist and primary care physician
* Consider revascularization options, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

The patient's prognosis is guarded, given her complex medical history and recent cardiac event. Close monitoring and management of her condition will be necessary to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), delirium/confusion, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She recently had a myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiac catheterization demonstrating severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention and is now being reevaluated for revascularization options.

The patient is currently on various medications, including aspirin, heparin, nitroglycerin, metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and lipitor. She has a nasogastric tube in place and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 114/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft and non-tender abdomen, with no signs of stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or scars. Her pulses are 1+ distal and peripheral.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, platelet count of 115 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is elevated at 1339 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. CAD: The patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She is being reevaluated for revascularization options.
2. CHF: The patient is well-compensated at present despite recent MIs and low ejection fraction. She will have a repeat echocardiogram to confirm measurement of high pulmonary artery pressure and severity of AS.
3. AFIB: The patient is now in sinus rhythm and will continue to be monitored on telemetry. She will continue to receive metoprolol.
4. AS: The patient will have a repeat echo to reassess aortic valve area and stenosis. However, in the setting of severe LV dysfunction and poor forward flow, this may be overestimated.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is thought to be secondary to hepatitis C. She will have a repeat platelet level.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is on heparin drip and PPI.
7. DNR/DNI: The patient's DNR/DNI status will be confirmed with her.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, cardiomyopathy, and AFIB puts her at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and she is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. She may be at risk for respiratory failure or pneumonia.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or aspiration.
* Infectious complications: The patient's history of hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia puts her at risk for infectious complications such as sepsis or pneumonia.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of bleeding complications puts her at risk for bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and she may be at risk for renal failure or acute kidney injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent myocardial infarction (MI). The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's recent events include chest pain, which was managed with nitroglycerin (NTG) drip. However, the patient's blood pressure (BP) dipped significantly, and the NTG drip was stopped. The patient's urine output (UOP) has been poor, and a bladder scan revealed no urine in the bladder. The patient's BPs have been in the 90s/50s, and metoprolol has been decreased to 12.5 TID.

The patient's physical examination is stable, with no signs of chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and her SpO2 is 96%. The patient's labs and radiology results are within normal limits, with the exception of elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac damage.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. CAD: The patient is currently CP-free, and enzymes will be trended. The patient will continue on aspirin, hold off on Plavix until surgical opinion, and wean off IV nitro, Lipitor, and Zestril. Metoprolol will be started at 25mg TID and titrated up as needed.
2. CHF: The patient is well-compensated at present, despite recent MIs and low EF. The patient will have a repeat TTE to confirm the measurement of high PA pressure and severity of AS.
3. AFib: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, and will continue to be monitored on telemetry. The patient will continue on metoprolol, and the reason for not anticoagulating will be clarified.
4. AS: The patient will have a repeat echo to reassess aortic valve area and stenosis, but in the setting of severe LV dysfunction and poor forward flow, this may be overestimated.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is thought to be secondary to hepatitis C, and the patient will have a repeat platelet level.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is on heparin drip and PPI.
7. DNR/DNI: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and this will be confirmed with the patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying CAD and AFib.
2. Thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Heart failure, which can worsen the patient's underlying CHF.
4. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be a complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Bloodstream infections, which can be a complication of central lines or IV catheters.
6. Thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, which can be a complication of immobility and underlying CAD.

Based on the patient's current condition and underlying medical issues, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results to prevent and manage potential complications."

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and delirium/confusion. She was admitted with an inferior STEMI and was transferred to the ICU for revaluation of revascularization options.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 91/66 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild regional dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease. She has a soft and non-tender abdomen, and her extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

The patient's laboratory results show mild renal insufficiency, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 21 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is elevated at 4.02 ng/mL, and her cardiac enzymes are trending downward.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Continuation of aspirin, holding off on plavix until surgical opinion, and weaning off iv nitro.
2. Decreased metoprolol to 12.5 TID with hypotension.
3. Obtaining angiography film from Hospital1 and sending disc on Monday with images.
4. Discussion with Dr. [**Doctor First Name 213**] about the patient's cardiac catheterization report.
5. Monitoring of urine output and renal function.
6. Holding off on diuresis and maintaining I/O.
7. Continuation of metoprolol, lisinopril, and lasix.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may require further management of her renal function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending downward, but she may still be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or further myocardial infarction.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is on heparin drip and may be at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her cardiac catheterization and the presence of foreign bodies.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

I recommend continued close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination. Further management of her cardiac and renal function should be based on her response to treatment and any changes in her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent myocardial infarction (STEMI). She is currently admitted to the ICU for revaluation and possible revascularization.

The patient's condition has been stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, but she has experienced some complications, including:

1. Chest pain: The patient had chest pain earlier in the day, which was controlled with nitroglycerin (NTG) drips. However, her blood pressure dipped to 78/50 mmHg, and she had poor urine output (UOP) from 1 pm to 4 pm. A bladder scan revealed no urine in the bladder, and she was bolused with 250cc x3, which increased her UOP.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, with readings ranging from 78/50 to 92/44 mmHg. She has required IV fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and she has required IV fluid boluses to maintain urine output. The possibility of pre-renal or ATN has been discussed.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has received 1.25L of boluses overnight, but not overloaded on exam. Her fluid status will be monitored with a CXR.
5. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient's rate is currently controlled, but she is not anti-coagulated due to thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, thought to be secondary to hepatitis C.
7. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient's aortic valve area and stenosis will be reassessed with a repeat echo.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Worsening of heart failure, leading to pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.
2. Development of renal failure or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which could require dialysis.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation.
4. Development of sepsis or multi-organ failure.
5. Increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and anticoagulation.
6. Development of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to decreased perfusion and coagulopathy.
7. Decreased cognitive function or delirium due to hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, or medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels.
3. Administration of IV fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain blood pressure.
4. Management of heart failure symptoms, including diuretics and vasodilators.
5. Reassessing the patient's aortic valve area and stenosis with a repeat echo.
6. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
7. Adjusting medications as necessary to maintain blood pressure, heart rate, and electrolyte balance.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is uncertain at this time. Further evaluation and management will be necessary to determine the best course of treatment for this complex patient."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI) with severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention and cardiac catheterization. She was transferred to the ICU for revaluation of options for revascularization.

The patient's current condition is stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, with a trend down in CK/CK-MB levels. She is receiving aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, zestril, and metoprolol, and is awaiting arrival of c.cath films from the outside hospital.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a trend down in creatinine levels, but with little improvement in urine output (UOP) despite receiving a total of 2172 cc of normal saline (NS) boluses over the past 24 hours. The urine lytes indicate pre-renal azotemia.

The patient has mild elevation in jugular venous pressure (JVP) but lungs are clear, and there is no lower extremity edema, suggesting mild heart failure (CHF).

The patient remains rate-controlled in atrial fibrillation (Afib) and has stable platelet counts, which are thought to be secondary to hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued decline in kidney function, potentially leading to further azotemia and acidosis.
2. Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to ongoing Afib.
3. Hemorrhage or bleeding complications due to continued heparin therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia exacerbation, potentially leading to bleeding or bruising.
5. Infection or sepsis due to compromised immune function.
6. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
7. Cardiac failure, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's code status is FULL, and she is being discharged to the floor pending further evaluation and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old female, is a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after suffering an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She has been transferred to the ICU for revaluation of options for revascularization. The patient has been receiving aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, zestril, and metoprolol. Her condition remains stable, with no evidence of ongoing ischemia.

The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and her urine electrolytes indicate pre-renal azotemia. She has received a total of 2172 cc of normal saline (NS) boluses over the past 24 hours with little improvement in urine output. The patient's blood pressure remains stable, with a systolic blood pressure ranging from 69-110 mmHg.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with metoprolol. She has also developed thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be secondary to hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complex, and she is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient's AKI may progress, leading to further deterioration in her renal function and potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and use of anticoagulants such as heparin may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and use of anticoagulants may increase her risk of developing infections.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac complications may increase her risk of developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and to adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 80-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She was transferred back to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is now being revaluated for options of revascularization.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. She has atrial fibrillation and is on heparin drip.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.8-11.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 38.7-40.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 115-105 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4-1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 4.02 ng/mL
* Glucose: 128-159 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.2/62.0/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 971/122/4.02, ALT/AST: 118/349, Alk Phos/T Bili: 95/0.7, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.1/2.0/3.2 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: In no acute distress, oriented x3, mood and affect appropriate
* HEENT: Normal
* Neck: Supple, JVP of ~10
* Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, faint S2, 4-20 ESM, 4-20 PSM
* Lungs: Clear, no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi
* Abdomen: Soft, no tenderness, no masses
* Extremities: No edema, no pulses
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas

The patient's medical issues include:

* Acute renal failure (ARF): Creatinine trending down, urine lytes indicate pre-renal azotemia
* Congestive heart failure (CHF): Mildly elevated JVP, lungs clear, no lower extremity edema
* Atrial fibrillation (Afib): Rate-controlled in the 60s
* Aspirin-induced thrombocytopenia: Platelet count stable, thought to be secondary to hepatitis C
* Prophylaxis: Heparin drip, PPI

The patient's code status is FULL, and she is being managed with small fluid boluses, aspirin, IV heparin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and other medications as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of ARF, leading to further electrolyte imbalance and potential need for dialysis
* Progression of CHF, leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure
* Development of bleeding complications due to heparin therapy
* Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding or bruising
* Infection, particularly given the patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines
* Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and presence of heparin therapy"

   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Patient remains CP free over past 24 hrs and

   .
   #) ARF- began while pt received NTG and pt became hyptonsive to 70s. Pt
   likely has became pre-renal from this episode of hypotension vs. ATN .
   Pt has needed IVF boluses since then to maintain UOP.
   - will check urine lytes for prerenal vs. ATN
   - will check urine Na prior to and after IVF bolus to see response
   - hold off on renal US as obstruction less likely
   - continue IVF boluses to maintain UOP >20cc/h and renal perfussion
   #) CHF: pt received 1.25L of boluses overnight, but not overloaded on
   exam
   - will check CXR for fluid status
   - hold off on diuresis
 maintain I/O even today, IVF boluses as above
   - continue metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix
   #) Afib: pt rate controlled currently
   - clarify why not anti-coaguated, likey [**3-19**] thrombocytopenia and
   bleeding risk
   - cont Metop at 12.5 TID

   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac catheterization demonstrating severe 3-vessel disease. She was transferred to the ICU with an inferior STEMI and is awaiting revascularization options. The patient is currently stable, with no evidence of ongoing ischemia. She has developed acute renal failure (ARF) and is receiving IV fluid boluses to maintain urine output. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is being monitored for thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to pre-renal failure from hypotension and may be exacerbated by the IV fluid boluses. Monitoring of urine electrolytes and adjusting the fluid regimen may be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is thought to be secondary to hepatitis C, but it may also be related to the use of heparin and other medications. Monitoring of platelet levels and adjusting the anticoagulation regimen may be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's severe 3-vessel disease and history of MI increase her risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Monitoring of cardiac function and adjusting the medication regimen as necessary may be necessary to prevent these complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines increase her risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results, as well as implementation of infection control measures, may be necessary to prevent these complications.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and use of anticoagulation medications increase her risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. Monitoring of bleeding risk and adjusting the anticoagulation regimen as necessary may be necessary to prevent these complications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including ARF, thrombocytopenia, cardiac complications, infection, and bleeding. Close monitoring and adjustment of the medication regimen as necessary may be necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Ischemic Heart Disease. She is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and has a history of cardiomyopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 38.7%
* Platelet count: 105 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 7.8 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mEq/L
* Electrolytes: Na<10, osm 540, FeNa 0.06%
* Troponin-T: 4.02 ng/mL
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with a total fluid input of 3,286 mL and a total fluid output of 310 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,976 mL. Her urine output is meager, ranging from 15-35 cc/hr.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 93% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her ABG results are not provided.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her impaired skin integrity and inability to assess her peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

The patient's medical history includes cardiomyopathy, and she is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion for DVT prophylaxis. She is also receiving antibiotics and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Fluid overload and pulmonary edema due to excessive fluid administration
* Renal failure due to hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalance
* Infection due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged hospitalization
* Bleeding complications due to heparin sodium infusion
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation and underlying cardiomyopathy
* Delirium and confusion due to underlying medical conditions and medication use

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and respiratory status. Additionally, the patient's DVT prophylaxis and antibiotic therapy should be continued, and her heparin sodium infusion should be closely monitored for bleeding complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59.8 kg female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease, and atrial flutter. The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 38.0%
* Platelet count: 105 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 7.8 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 4.02 ng/mL
* Electrolytes: Na<10, osm 540, FeNa 0.06%

The patient's urine output has been meager, with a total output of 310 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's urine sodium is less than 10 mEq/L, and the urine osmolality is 540 mOsm/kg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for atrial fibrillation, with a heart rate of 67 bpm and a blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg. The patient's lungs are clear, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's medical history includes a history of cardiomyopathy, and the patient is currently on heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation, which may lead to cardiac arrest or stroke.
* Cardiac failure, which may lead to pulmonary edema or cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure, which may lead to respiratory arrest or pneumonia.
* Infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis, which may lead to septic shock or organ failure.
* Renal failure, which may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
* Nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies, which may lead to weakness, fatigue, or impaired wound healing.

The patient's current code status is full code, and the patient's family is in favor of surgery. The patient's disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of multiple medical issues, including cardiac disease, who was admitted to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and severe 3VD. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was deemed not a candidate for CABG due to high risk. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Current Condition:

The patient is currently paced at a rate of 75 bpm, with a BP of 106/58 mmHg, RR of 10 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 94%. She has a moderate degree of bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, as evident on CXR. Her urine output has been low, with a urine sodium of 15, suggesting pre-renal azotemia.

Potential Complications:

1. Cardiac: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, with a history of MI, severe 3VD, and AF with slow ventricular response. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her overall condition.
3. Renal: The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which could further complicate her condition.
4. Thrombotic: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's history of cardiac catheterization and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing an infection, such as sepsis or endocarditis.

Plan:

1. Continue aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor to manage the patient's cardiac condition.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust pacing as necessary.
3. Continue small fluid boluses to maintain MAPS>60 and check CVP to ensure euvolemia.
4. Monitor the patient's urine output and electrolytes to assess for signs of pre-renal azotemia.
5. Consult with the EP to determine whether to place a permanent pacer.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
7. Continue prophylactic measures, including PPI and heparin gtt, to prevent thrombotic complications.
8. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Patient remains CP free over past 48 hrs. Cath films

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Temp vent PM placed yesterday for slow AF in setting of recent IMI, now
   paced 70, with SBP 100.
   Continues with rising Cr 2.1 with poor urine output.
   I reviewed angio from [**Hospital1 3633**] [**2181-7-17**]:   80% distal left main involving
   origin of LAD, 80% ostial RCA.  Also known to have moderate AS and mod
   severe TR.
   Physical Examination
   + JVD.
   Medical Decision Making
   CT surgery requests hepatology consult and will also obtain renal
   consult.  Will then discuss options of AVR/CABG vs high risk stenting
   vs med Rx.   EP to follow and check underlying rhythm to decide re need
   for perm PM.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   I reviewed angio from [**Hospital1 3633**] [**2181-7-17**]:   80% distal left main involving
   origin of LAD, 80% ostial RCA.  Also known to have moderate AS and mod
   severe TR.
   Physical Examination
   + JVD.
   Medical Decision Making
   CT surgery requests hepatology consult and will also obtain renal
   consult.  Will then discuss options of AVR/CABG vs high risk stenting
   vs med Rx.   EP to follow and check underlying rhythm to decide re need
   for perm PM.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is still slow, and there is a risk of further bradycardia or even cardiac arrest.
	* Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF, and the temporary wire placed yesterday is capturing appropriately. However, there is a risk of AF returning or developing other arrhythmias.
	* Moderate Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has moderate AS, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of heart failure, and decreased exercise tolerance.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is rising, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
	* Pre-renal Azotemia: The patient's urine output is low, and the urine electrolytes suggest pre-renal azotemia. This can lead to further kidney damage and increased risk of ARF.
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The patient has low lung volumes and compressive atelectasis, which can lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of pneumonia.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Hepatitis C: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to hepatitis C. There is a risk of further complications, such as liver failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
5. Hemodynamic Complications:
	* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still relatively low, and there is a risk of further hypotension or even shock.
	* Fluid Overload: The patient is receiving fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 60, but there is a risk of fluid overload, especially with the patient's pre-existing cardiac and renal conditions.
6. Other Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and there is a risk of further thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications.
	* Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and there is a risk of further imbalance, especially with the patient's pre-existing cardiac and renal conditions.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent or mitigate these complications."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. He received a 500cc bolus of fluid and was bradycardic, leading to the insertion of a temporary pacemaker. The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently ventricular-paced. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and a retrocardiac opacity.

The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and a urine sodium level of 15 mmol/L. His blood pressure is 106/58 mmHg, and his heart rate is 75 beats per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and atrial flutter. He is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and has a temporary pacemaker in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine sodium level is low, indicating possible prerenal azotemia. Further fluid management and monitoring are necessary to prevent worsening of kidney function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac rhythm is ventricular-paced, and he has a history of atrial flutter. Further cardiac monitoring and management are necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and complications.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, which can lead to respiratory distress and failure. Further respiratory management, including oxygen therapy and possible chest tube placement, may be necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a history of diarrhea, which can increase the risk of infection. Further monitoring and management of the patient's infection risk are necessary.
5. Delirium: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is at risk for delirium. Further monitoring and management of the patient's mental status are necessary to prevent delirium and its complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI) with severe 3-vessel disease (3VD) deemed not amenable to intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was transferred to the current hospital with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: Bradycardic to 30-40 beats per minute (bpm) with a temporary pacemaker in place, capturing appropriately. Metoprolol is being held to reduce nodal blockade.
* Respiratory: Low lung volumes, likely bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, and retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray (CXR). Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 94% on nasal cannula.
* Hemodynamic: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 60-80 mmHg, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg.
* Renal: Urine output is low, with a urine sodium (Na) of 15 mEq/L. Creatinine (Cr) is 2.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is not reported.
* Hepatic: Total bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) is 95 IU/L.
* Coagulation: Platelet count is stable, with a platelet count of 101,000/mm3.
* Electrolytes: Sodium (Na) is 131 mEq/L, potassium (K) is 4.4 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg) is 2.0 mg/dL.
* Hematology: White blood cell count (WBC) is 7.8-11.5 x 10^9/L, and hemoglobin (Hb) is 11.7-11.2 g/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Cardiac:
	* Bradycardia: may lead to cardiac arrest or decreased cardiac output.
	* Atrial fibrillation (AF) with slow ventricular response: may lead to decreased cardiac output, heart failure, or stroke.
2. Respiratory:
	* Bilateral pleural effusions: may lead to respiratory failure or decreased lung volumes.
	* Compressive atelectasis: may lead to respiratory failure or decreased lung volumes.
3. Renal:
	* Low urine output: may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
	* Elevated creatinine: may indicate kidney damage or dysfunction.
4. Hepatic:
	* Elevated bilirubin: may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
	* Elevated Alk Phos: may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
5. Coagulation:
	* Thrombocytopenia: may lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of bleeding.
6. Electrolytes:
	* Hyponatremia: may lead to seizures, brain damage, or death.
	* Hyperkalemia: may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or death.
7. Hematology:
	* Anemia: may lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, fatigue, or decreased exercise tolerance.
	* Leukopenia: may lead to increased risk of infections or decreased immune function.

The patient's plan includes continued aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, zestril, and metoprolol, as well as monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia or infarction. The patient is awaiting consultation with the cardiologist regarding revascularization options, including CABG or aortic valve replacement (AVR)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI) and severe three-vessel disease (3VD) deemed not amenable to intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She has been transferred to the ICU for revaluation and potential revascularization.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no evidence of ongoing ischemia. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) with a slow ventricular response, which has been treated with a temporary wire and metoprolol hold. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 50%, and she appears euvolemic but has low urine output and urine electrolytes suggesting pre-renal azotemia.

The patient has been prescribed various medications, including aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, zestril, and metoprolol, and is awaiting further recommendations from the cardiologist regarding CABG and aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's AF with slow ventricular response may persist or worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and pre-renal azotemia may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains stable, but may decline further, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient's low urine output and electrolyte imbalance may increase the risk of sepsis, particularly if the underlying cause is not addressed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU increases the risk of nosocomial infections, particularly pneumonia and urinary tract infections.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of bradycardia and hypotension. He was given a 500cc bolus for SBP 80's and later received a temporary pacemaker and v-paced in the 70's. The patient has a history of bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and retrocardiac opacity. He is receiving IV fluids and has a urinary output of 10-25cc/hr overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may be indicative of a cardiac condition, such as heart failure or a cardiac arrhythmia. The temporary pacemaker and v-paced therapy may be necessary to maintain a stable heart rate.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis may be causing respiratory distress. The patient may require mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and potentially worsen his respiratory and cardiac status.
4. Infection: The patient's urinary output is low, which may indicate a urinary tract infection. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, which may be a sign of infection.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he may require further management to maintain adequate blood pressure.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium and potassium levels are slightly abnormal, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance. This may require further management to prevent complications.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency. This may require further management to prevent worsening of kidney function.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine level may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as nephrotic syndrome or bowel obstruction."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Patient remains CP free over past 48 hrs. Cath films
   from [**Hospital1 3633**] currently under review of CT [**Doctor First Name 213**].
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs regarding whether CABG/AVR will be offered
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Patient brady to 30-40
   yesterday. Temporary wire placed by EP which is capturing
   appropriately. Metoprolol being held to reduce nodal blockade.
   Decision whether to place permanent pacer dependent on decision
   regarding CABG.
   - f/u EP recs
   - will check underlying rhythm today, timing of pacer will depend on
   whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #)PUMP: EF 50% (recorded as 15-20% at OSH ECHO). Patient appears
   euvolemic though urine output has been low and urine lytes suggests she
   is dry.
   - check CVP (goal 15)
   - cont small fluid boluses to keep MAPS>60
   - d/c lisinopril
   .
   #) ARF: Cr cont to trend up, now 2.2 Urine lytes have been consistent
   with pre-renal azotemia.
   -recheck urine lytes, eos
   -renally dose all meds
   .
   #) Moderate AS:As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with patient and health care proxies on
   [**7-29**])
   .
   #) Dispo: CCU for now

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI) with severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She was transferred to the current hospital with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options. The patient is currently in the ICU, with a temporary pacemaker wire in place due to bradycardia. She has been receiving aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor, and is holding metoprolol and lisinopril.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm (range 32-80)
* Blood pressure: 106/58 mmHg (range 70-107/39-75)
* Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (range 8-27)
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General: Oriented x3, mood and affect appropriate
* HEENT: Normal
* Neck: Supple, JVP ~10
* Cardiac: RRR, normal S1, faint S2, 4-20 ESM and PSM
* Lungs: CTAB, faint crackles, wheezes or rhonchi
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no HSM or tenderness
* Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 38.7%
* Platelets: 115 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Uric acid: 18 mg/dL
* Sodium: 131 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
* Chloride: 104 mEq/L
* Bicarbonate: 34.0 mmHg
* Blood urea nitrogen: 10.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac: The patient's severe 3-vessel disease and prior MI make her at high risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL suggests acute kidney injury, which may be related to her cardiac condition, medication, or other factors.
3. Respiratory: The patient's low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's history of hepatitis C and recent hospitalization make her at risk for infection, particularly with hospital-acquired pathogens.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and recent cardiac catheterization may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
6. Metabolic: The patient's hyperglycemia may increase her risk of diabetic complications, such as ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypochloremia, may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other complications."

   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Cont to be chest pain free. Cath films under review

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C, cardiac issues, and liver lesions. She has had a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: She has an inferior STEMI, is paced, and has a poor RV function.
* Liver: She has liver lesions, Child's class 3, significant risk of cardiac surgery, and possible HCC.
* Renal: She has acute kidney injury (ATN) with elevated creatinine, likely due to poor forward flow and contrast nephropathy.
* Hepatitis C: She has been infected with Hepatitis C since 2153 and has had multiple biopsies of liver lesions, but never received interferon.
* Other: She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with cipro.

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac: The patient's poor RV function and pre-load dependent heart failure may lead to further cardiac complications, such as worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Liver: The patient's liver lesions may represent HCC, which could lead to liver failure, portal hypertension, or other complications.
* Renal: The patient's ATN may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or the need for dialysis.
* Hepatitis C: The patient's Hepatitis C infection may lead to further liver damage, cirrhosis, or HCC.
* UTI: The patient's UTI may worsen, leading to sepsis, bacteremia, or other complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications or the need for platelet transfusions.

The patient's current plan is to continue aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor, and to hold metoprolol and lisinopril. The patient will undergo further evaluation and management, including cardiac catheterization, liver imaging, and renal function monitoring. The patient's code status is FULL, and she will be cared for in the CCU for now."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   No chest pain.    Quite weak.   Poor urine output 250 cc.   Cr 2.1.
   Appreciate renal and hepatology input.
   I reviewed angio showing tight left main extending in ostial LAD and
   tight ostial RCA, both amenable to stenting.
   Medical Decision Making
   Liver team may need repeat MRI to fully characterize liver lesions.
   Will continue to monitor renal function and revasc will need to await
   renal function improvement.
   Eventually may be better candidate for high risk stenting rather than
   CABG/AVR.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Cont to be chest pain free. Cath films under review
   by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] (CABG vs high risk stent)
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs regarding whether CABG/AVR will be offered if
   not then possible high risk stenting
   - awaiting liver recs (obtaining prior MRI)
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Pt s/p temporary pacemaker
   placement. HRs remain in the 60
s-70
   - f/u EP recs
   -  timing of pacer will depend on whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   (could have pacer placed at that time)
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #)PUMP: ECHO demonstrates poor RV fct
 pre-load dependent. CVP ranging
   from [**11-29**]. Plan is to cont with small boluses to improve her forward
   flow.
   - cont small fluid boluses with goal CVP 15
   - holding lisinopril and lasix
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.1. (Baseline of 0.7). Given steady
   decline this likely represents an evolving ATN.  A contributing factor
   is likely her poor forward flow versus contrast nephropathy from recent
   cath. We will cont to hold lasix and ACE at this time.
   - f/u renal recs
   -renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) HepC: Liver consulted yesterday. Question as to whether liver
   lesions may represent HCC, although biopsies have been negative in the
   past.
   - appreciate liver recs
   - obtain OSH MRI
   #. UTI: Pt with UTI treated with cipro.
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with patient and health care proxies on
   [**7-29**])
   .
   #) Dispo: CCU for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   No chest pain.    Quite weak.   Poor urine output 250 cc.   Cr 2.1.
   Appreciate renal and hepatology input.
   I reviewed angio showing tight left main extending in ostial LAD and
   tight ostial RCA, both amenable to stenting.
   Medical Decision Making
   Liver team may need repeat MRI to fully characterize liver lesions.
   Will continue to monitor renal function and revasc will need to await
   renal function improvement.
   Eventually may be better candidate for high risk stenting rather than
   CABG/AVR.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hepatitis C, liver lesions, and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). She has had a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and has been deemed a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI), atrial fibrillation (AF), and moderate aortic stenosis (AS).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62-79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Her physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for a faint murmur at the apex of her heart.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (2.1 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (19 mg/dL), and liver enzymes (ALT 99 IU/L, AST 184 IU/L). Her platelet count is 115,000/μL, and her troponin-T level is 4.05 ng/mL.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing aspirin, IV heparin, and lipid-lowering therapy.
2. Holding metoprolol and lisinopril.
3. Awaiting the results of a computed tomography (CT) scan to determine whether CABG/AVR or high-risk stenting is the best option.
4. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting therapy accordingly.
5. Continuing to hold lasix and ACE inhibitors.
6. Monitoring the patient's liver function and considering further evaluation with MRI.
7. Managing the patient's atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation therapy.
8. Considering the patient's thrombocytopenia and potential need for splenectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's multivessel CAD and recent MI increase her risk of cardiac complications, including recurrent MI, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Renal complications: The patient's AKI and elevated creatinine levels increase her risk of renal failure and the need for dialysis.
3. Liver complications: The patient's liver lesions and elevated liver enzymes increase her risk of liver failure and the need for liver transplantation.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and potential need for splenectomy increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection complications: The patient's UTI and potential need for invasive procedures increase her risk of infection complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and potential need for anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of neurological complications, including stroke and bleeding in the brain."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including:

1. Hepatitis C (HCV) infection since 1993, which led to splenectomy and multiple liver biopsies.
2. Severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with multivessel disease, including 50% stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA) and 80% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery (LMA).
3. Recent myocardial infarction (MI) with inferior STEMI.
4. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe 3VD, deemed not amenable to intervention, and the patient is a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
5. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a slow ventricular response, which is being managed with a temporary wire and holding metoprolol.
6. The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a rising creatinine level and pre-renal azotemia, likely due to atheroembolic or contrast-induced nephropathy.
7. The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be secondary to HCV infection.
8. The patient has moderate aortic stenosis (AS).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Worsening of CAD, leading to further MI or cardiac arrest.
	* Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
	* Increased risk of cardiac surgery complications.
2. Renal complications:
	* Progression of AKI to acute renal failure (ARF), requiring dialysis.
	* Development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Liver complications:
	* Worsening of liver disease, leading to cirrhosis or liver failure.
	* Development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
4. Infectious complications:
	* Bacterial or fungal infections, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
	* Development of catheter-related infections.
5. Bleeding complications:
	* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy.
	* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, splenectomy, and multibiparietal liver lesions. He was admitted to the ICU with cardiac complications, including a high central venous pressure (CVP), tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a temporary wire and the administration of heparin. His liver function is compromised, with a Child's class 3 status and significant risk of cardiac surgery. He has also developed atheroembolic renal disease, and his creatinine levels are elevated. The patient has been prescribed ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection and has undergone echocardiography, which revealed infarcts in the right ventricle and ant-septal hypokinesis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Further cardiac infarction or damage due to the presence of multivessel coronary artery disease.
	* Development of cardiac failure or arrhythmias due to the patient's compromised liver function.
2. Hepatic Complications:
	* Progression of liver disease and potential development of liver failure.
	* Increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's compromised liver function and high bilirubin levels.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Further decline in renal function or development of acute kidney injury due to atheroembolic disease or contrast-induced nephropathy.
	* Potential development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's compromised immune system and presence of urinary tract infection.
	* Potential development of other infections, such as pneumonia or catheter-related infections.
5. Hematological Complications:
	* Development of bleeding complications due to the patient's compromised platelet count and coagulopathy.
	* Potential development of anemia or thrombocytopenia due to ongoing liver disease and potential bone marrow suppression.
6. Other Complications:
	* Development of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders due to the patient's compromised liver function and potential kidney disease.
	* Potential development of malnutrition or dehydration due to the patient's compromised nutritional status and potential gastrointestinal complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old male with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C, splenectomy, and liver lesions. The patient is currently in the ICU due to:

1. Cardiac issues: The patient has a paced rhythm, likely due to a recent anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has a high risk of cardiac surgery and possible hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
2. Renal issues: The patient has atheroembolic and contrast-induced acute kidney injury (ATN) with a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Liver issues: The patient has Child's class 3 liver disease, significant risk of cardiac surgery, and possible HCC.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient requires oxygen therapy and has a recent ABG showing pH 7.19, which may indicate respiratory acidosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Cont to be chest pain free. Cath films under review
   by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs regarding whether CABG/AVR will be offered
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Pt s/p temporary pacemaker
   placement. HRs remain in the 60
s-70
   - f/u EP recs
   -  timing of pacer will depend on whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   (could have pacer placed at that time)
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #)PUMP: ECHO demonstrates poor RV fct
 pre-load dependent. CVP ranging
   from [**11-29**]. Plan is to cont with small boluses to improve her forward
   flow.
   - cont small fluid boluses with goal CVP 15
   - holding lisinopril and lasix
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.1. (Baseline of 0.7). Given steady
   decline this likely represents an evolving ATN.  A contributing factor
   is likely her poor forward flow versus contrast nephropathy from recent
   cath. We will cont to hold lasix and ACE at this time.
   - f/u renal recs
   -renally dose all meds
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with patient and health care proxies on
   [**7-29**])
   .
   #) Dispo: CCU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including:

* Hepatitis C (HCV) since 2153, following a blood transfusion and splenectomy
* Recent myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiac catheterization demonstrating severe 3-vessel disease (3VD) deemed not amenable to intervention
* Returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and transferred to the ICU for revaluation for option of revascularization

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic instability with a central venous pressure (CVP) ranging from 10-29 mmHg
* Poor right ventricular (RV) function, pre-load dependent
* Elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and contrast nephropathy
* Thrombocytopenia, thought to be secondary to HCV
* Moderate aortic stenosis (AS)
* Hepatic dysfunction, with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels
* Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen therapy
* Cardiovascular support with temporary pacemaker placement

The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Cardiac arrest due to worsening RV function and decreased cardiac output
	+ Heart failure due to poor LV function and increased LV filling pressures
	+ Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT)
* Renal complications:
	+ Worsening ATN and acute kidney injury (AKI)
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
* Hepatic complications:
	+ Worsening liver dysfunction and increased risk of liver failure
	+ Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development
* Infectious complications:
	+ Bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia
	+ Viral infections, including HCV reactivation

The patient's management plan includes:

* Cardiovascular support with small fluid boluses and temporary pacemaker placement
* Renal support with holding diuretics and ACE inhibitors
* Hepatic support with monitoring liver function tests and considering antiviral therapy for HCV
* Prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and heparin
* Code status: FULL
* Disposition: CCU for now"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac catheterization, and severe 3-vessel disease. She was deemed not amenable to intervention and is now being evaluated for revascularization options.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hypoxia: The patient is hypoxic with a recent ABG showing pH 7.40, pCO2 27, and pO2 64. She is receiving 10L of oxygen via non-rebreather mask and is being treated with lasix gtt to manage volume overload and pulmonary edema.
* Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has AF with a slow ventricular response, and a temporary pacemaker has been placed. The plan is to cardiovert the patient to sinus rhythm, pending the assessment of her liver disease and cardiac function.
* CAD/STEMI: The patient has CAD with a recent STEMI, and CT surgery recommendations are pending the assessment of her liver disease.
* PUMP: The patient is experiencing volume overload, with increased pulmonary edema and lower extremity edema. The plan is to continue dopamine to maintain MAPs >60, and lasix gtt to manage volume overload.
* ARF: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 2.3. The plan is to continue holding ACE inhibitors and to renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
* Moderate AS: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis, and CT surgery recommendations are pending the assessment of her liver disease.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, and the possibility of splenectomy secondary to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is being considered.
* HepC: The patient has hepatitis C, and hepatology is reviewing her liver MRI to assess the size of her liver lesions.
* UTI: The patient is being treated with Cipro for a urinary tract infection (UTI).
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving PPI and heparin gtt as prophylaxis.
* Code Status: The patient has a full code status.
* Dispo: The patient is being admitted to the CCU for further management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and she may experience further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or the need for intubation.
* Renal complications: The patient's ARF may progress, leading to further renal damage or the need for renal replacement therapy.
* Hepatic complications: The patient's hepatitis C may worsen, leading to further liver damage or the need for liver transplantation.
* Infection complications: The patient may develop further infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia, which could worsen her overall condition.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Hypotension: The patient's MAPs are in the low 50s, indicating potential hypotension. The use of dopamine and lasix may help to maintain MAPs >60.
	* Cardiac tamponade: The patient has severe 3VD and is a high-risk candidate for CABG. This may lead to cardiac tamponade, which can be life-threatening.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's CXR demonstrates increased pulmonary edema, which may indicate ARDS.
	* Pneumonia: The patient's lung sounds are diminished at the bases with scattered crackles, which may indicate pneumonia.
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's Cr remains elevated at 2.3, indicating AKI. This may be due to contrast nephropathy from recent catheterization or ATN.
	* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and they may be at risk for renal failure.
4. Hepatic complications:
	* Hepatic failure: The patient has hepatitis C and may be at risk for hepatic failure.
	* Liver lesions: The patient's liver MRI is being reviewed, and repeat imaging may be necessary to assess the size of known liver lesions.
5. Hematological complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
	* Splenectomy: The patient may require splenectomy due to ITP.
6. Infectious complications:
	* UTI: The patient is being treated with Cipro for a UTI.
	* Sepsis: The patient's temperature is normal, but they may be at risk for sepsis due to their underlying medical conditions.
7. Other complications:
	* Volume overload: The patient appears more volume overloaded, which may lead to further complications.
	* Poor forward flow: The patient's poor forward flow may lead to further complications, including cardiac tamponade and ARDS.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac catheterization, and severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She was transferred to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is now being revaluated for options for revascularization. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema, and has been treated with lasix and oxygen therapy. She also has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, and a temporary pacemaker has been placed. The patient has been experiencing acute kidney injury (AKI) and has been treated with dopamine and lasix. She also has moderate aortic stenosis and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen if the underlying volume overload and pulmonary edema are not effectively managed.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition, including atrial fibrillation and severe 3-vessel disease, may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest or heart failure.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's AKI may worsen if the underlying causes are not addressed, leading to further kidney damage or failure.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if she undergoes invasive procedures or surgery.
5. Liver disease: The patient's hepatitis C infection may lead to further liver damage or failure, which could have significant implications for her overall health.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further if the underlying causes of her hypoxia are not effectively managed.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase her risk of infection, particularly if she develops sepsis or septic shock.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac condition may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her hypoxia, cardiac status, kidney function, and liver disease. Further consultation with specialists, such as cardiology and hepatology, may be necessary to optimize her care and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Related to volume overload and pulmonary edema and now 10L
   positive LOS. Pt continues to be hypoxic to low 90s on non-rebreather
   with most recent ABG 7.40/ 27 / 64
   - starting lasix gtt
   - will speak to [**Year (4 digits) **] if ultrafiltration is an option
   - cont non-rebreather, speak to family about intubation and code status
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Temporary pacemaker rate reduced
   to 40 yesterday which resulted in HR mainly in the 40
s-60
s.  Because
   of pt
s IMI pt preload dependent and CO may improve some if
   cardioverted with return of atrial kick.
   - will speak to EP on cardioverting to sinus
   -  timing of pacer will depend on whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   (could have pacer placed at that time)
   -  monitor on telemetry
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of [**Year (4 digits) **] function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   #) PUMP: Patient appearing more volume overloaded- CXR with increased
   pulm edema, increased lower ext edema. Likely this is a combination of
   RV dysfunction and subsequent poor forward flow and continued [**Doctor First Name **]
   insufficiency. CVP now in the 20
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt
   - holding lisinopril.
   - speak to [**Doctor First Name **] about ultrafiltration
   .
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.3. (Baseline of 0.7). Likely
   represents an evolving ATN.  A contributing factor is likely her poor
   forward flow versus contrast nephropathy from recent cath. We will cont
   to hold ACE at this time. Cr is currently plataued
   - f/u [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   -renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) HepC:  Hepatology reviewing OSH liver MRI. She will likely need a
   repeat liver MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] function improves in order to assess whether
   known liver lesions increasing in size.
   - f/u liver recs
   #. UTI: Cont Cipro (day [**4-17**]).
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with patient and health care proxies on
   [**7-29**])
   .
   #) Dispo: CCU for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7999**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Deterioration overnight with hypotension, poor urine output,
   desaturation.
   Now on Dopamine 5 with evidence of rales and minor resp distress on
   nonrebreather.
   BUN 81 Cr 2.3.
   Continues in AFIB.
   Physical Examination
   Rales 1/3 up.
   Moderate AS.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will attempt diuresis with high dose lasix and hydodiuril.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need ultrafiltration if no good response to diuretics.
   Will discuss with EP possibility of cardioversion.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac catheterization, and severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was transferred to the ICU with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAPs in the low 50s with no urine output (UOP) over 2 hours. Dopamine was started at 0145 with improvement in MAPs to 57-60.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device is a non-rebreather mask, and SpO2 is 96%. ABG results show pH 7.40, PaCO2 27, and PaO2 64.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation (AF) with slow ventricular response. Temporary pacemaker rate was reduced to 40 yesterday, resulting in a heart rate mainly in the 40-60 range.
* Renal function: Creatinine (Cr) remains elevated at 2.3, likely representing an evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Liver function: Hepatology is reviewing the patient's liver MRI, and she will likely need a repeat liver MRI once liver function improves.
* Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains stable, and the question of splenectomy secondary to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is being considered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and she may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's AF with slow ventricular response may worsen, and cardioversion may be necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient's Cr levels are elevated, and she may require ultrafiltration or hemodialysis.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may require liver transplantation.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decrease, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to ARDS.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of UOP may indicate sepsis.
8. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac catheterization and subsequent cardiac tamponade may lead to cardiac tamponade syndrome.

The patient's code status is FULL, and she is being treated in the CCU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac catheterization, and severe three-vessel disease. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening heart failure and acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.2°C (95.4°F)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm (46-75)
* Blood pressure: 106/53 mmHg (67-135/77-81)
* Respiratory rate: 3 inspirations per minute (3-28)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.8-11.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 38.7-40.5%
* Platelet count: 115-126 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4-2.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 4.02-4.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 159-139 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: In no acute distress, oriented x1-2 (person, place), mood and affect appropriate
* HEENT: Normal cranial CT scan, sclera anicteric, pupils equal and reactive
* Neck: Supple, elevated jugular venous pressure
* Cardiac: Regular rhythm, faint S2, 4th and 5th heart sounds
* Lungs: Breath sounds diminished at bases with scattered crackles
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses or bruits
* Extremities: Trace lower extremity edema
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* Pulses: 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: Due to volume overload and pulmonary edema, with an ABG of 7.40/27/64.
2. Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response: Temporary pacemaker rate reduced to 40 yesterday, with a heart rate mainly in the 40-60 range.
3. Cardiac catheterization: Severe three-vessel disease, deemed not amenable to intervention.
4. Acute kidney injury: Creatinine remains elevated at 2.3 mg/dL, likely representing an evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains stable, with a question of splenectomy secondary to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
6. Hepatitis C: Hepatology reviewing OSH liver MRI, with a repeat liver MRI planned if liver function improves.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

* Dopamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min
* Lasix gtt
* Heparin sodium infusion at 400 units/hour
* Furosemide (Lasix) 40 mg IV x 1
* Aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor for CAD/s/p STEMI
* Holding metoprolol and lisinopril
* Cont non-rebreather oxygen therapy
* Monitoring on telemetry

The patient's code status is full, and she is currently in the CCU for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including cardiac disease, liver disease, and acute kidney injury. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 135/77 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on a non-rebreather mask, and her respiratory rate is 3 inspirations per minute.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, which has been managed with a temporary pacemaker. Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe three-vessel disease, which is deemed not amenable to intervention.

The patient's liver function is compromised, with elevated liver enzymes and a possible diagnosis of acute liver failure. Her renal function is also impaired, with an elevated creatinine level and a steady decline, likely representing an evolving acute tubular necrosis.

The patient's medical history includes a recent myocardial infarction, cardiac catheterization, and hospitalization for an inferior STEMI. She has also been diagnosed with hepatitis C and is being treated with antiviral medications.

The patient's medications include aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, and ciprofloxacin, which have been adjusted based on her laboratory results and clinical status.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Acute kidney injury with ongoing ATN and the need for continued fluid management and medication adjustments.
2. Liver failure with the possibility of acute liver failure and the need for further evaluation and management.
3. Cardiac complications, including atrial fibrillation and possible cardiac tamponade, which require ongoing monitoring and management.
4. Thrombocytopenia, which may require further evaluation and management, including the possibility of splenectomy.
5. Hepatitis C, which requires ongoing antiviral treatment and monitoring.
6. UTI, which has been treated with ciprofloxacin.
7. Potential complications of cardiac catheterization, including contrast nephropathy and cardiac tamponade.

Based on the patient's clinical status and laboratory results, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor, and hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust the temporary pacemaker rate as necessary.
3. Continue small fluid boluses to improve the patient's forward flow and manage her cardiac status.
4. Hold lasix and ACE inhibitors until further evaluation and management of her renal function.
5. Continue antiviral treatment for hepatitis C and monitor the patient's liver function.
6. Obtain an OSH MRI to further evaluate the patient's liver lesions and possible diagnosis of HCC.
7. Monitor the patient's UTI and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue prophylaxis with PPI and heparin gtt.
9. Discharge the patient to the CCU for further evaluation and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55.5 kg male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been experiencing acute renal failure, and efforts are being made to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 60-65 range. The patient has been receiving dopamine infusions and has shown improvement in MAP, but continues to require oxygen supplementation. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm and a blood pressure of 106/53 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Acute Renal Failure: The patient's MAP is still in the low 50's, which may indicate a continued risk of worsening acute renal failure.
2. Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease, combined with the ongoing use of dopamine infusions, may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's continued requirement for oxygen supplementation may indicate a risk of respiratory complications such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
4. Delirium and Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of delirium or confusion, which can be a complication of critical illness.
5. Skin Integrity Complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin complications such as pressure ulcers or skin infections.
6. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which may worsen if not properly managed.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea and altered elimination may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as sepsis or electrolyte imbalances.

Further monitoring and management are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been stable, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranging from 57-60 mmHg. The patient has required increased oxygen support, with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient has also developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) and acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure, potentially leading to dialysis dependence.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the UTI.
3. Increased risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest, due to the patient's pre-existing coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.
4. Progression of delirium or confusion, potentially leading to increased risk of falls or other adverse events.
5. Development of pressure ulcers or impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility.
6. Increased risk of respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. Failure to control glucose levels, potentially leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
8. Development of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's critical illness.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

   free.
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs

   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Temporary pacemaker rate reduced
   to 40 yesterday which resulted in HR mainly in the 40
s-60
   - f/u EP recs
   -  timing of pacer will depend on whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   (could have pacer placed at that time)
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Patient appearing more volume overloaded- CXR with increased
   pulm edema, increased lower ext edema. Likely this is a combination of
   RV dysfunction and subsequent poor forward flow and continued [**Doctor First Name **]
   insufficiency. CVP now in the 20
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt
   - holding lisinopril.

   may also have been component of sleep apnea. Currently diuresing as per
   above. Patient requiring non-breather to keep sats >93%.
   - diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.3. (Baseline of 0.7). Likely
   represents an evolving ATN.  A contributing factor is likely her poor

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiac catheterization demonstrating severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She was transferred to the ICU for revaluation for options of revascularization. The patient is currently experiencing:

1. Cardiac issues:
	* Atrial fibrillation (AF) with slow ventricular response
	* Reduced cardiac output due to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and poor forward flow
	* Elevated central venous pressure (CVP)
2. Respiratory issues:
	* Pulmonary edema with increased lower extremity edema
	* Hypoxia requiring non-rebreather oxygen therapy
3. Renal issues:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine (2.3 mg/dL)
	* Considered to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and contrast nephropathy
4. Hepatic issues:
	* Hepatitis C (HCV) infection
	* Hepatologist reviewing liver MRI to assess liver lesions
5. Hematological issues:
	* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 115 K/uL)
	* Considered to be secondary to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac:
	* Worsening RV dysfunction and decreased cardiac output
	* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias
	* Potential for cardiac arrest
2. Respiratory:
	* Worsening pulmonary edema and hypoxia
	* Increased risk of respiratory failure
3. Renal:
	* Progressive AKI and potential need for dialysis
	* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances and acidosis
4. Hepatic:
	* Progression of liver disease and potential for liver failure
	* Increased risk of bleeding and coagulopathy
5. Hematological:
	* Increased risk of bleeding and hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia
	* Potential need for platelet transfusions

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue diuresis to manage pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary to manage AKI.
4. Consult with the hepatologist to assess the patient's liver function and develop a plan for managing liver disease.
5. Consider platelet transfusions to manage thrombocytopenia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider antiviral therapy for HCV infection.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac output and adjust treatment as necessary to manage RV dysfunction."

   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Related to volume overload and pulmonary edema (9.5L
   positive LOS) though most recent CXR shows some improvement. She
   continues to sat in the low 90
s on non-rebreather. Most recent  ABG
   7.45/25/61/18
   - cont lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis. Would consider starting UF if
   diuresis becomes less effective
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Pacer rate increased to 80
   yesterday in an effort to improve stroke volume. We suspect that
   patient is reliant on atrial kick and would consider cardioversion but
   are holding off on this until her volume status improves.
   - f/u EP recs (consider amio vs. cardioversion)
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired [**Year (4 digits) **] and RV function. We are attempting to aggressively
   diurese her at this time to improve forward flow dynamics.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt and diuril

   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - restart IV heparin after discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] regarding possible
   line placement
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.4. (Baseline of 0.7). We feel this is
   most likely ATN. The etiology likely being a combination of impaired
   forward flow and possibly contrast nephropathy. We cont to avoid
   nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Related to volume overload and pulmonary edema (9.5L
   positive LOS) though most recent CXR shows some improvement. She
   continues to sat in the low 90
s on non-rebreather. Most recent  ABG
   7.45/25/61/18
   - cont lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis. Would consider starting UF if
   diuresis becomes less effective
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Pacer rate increased to 80
   yesterday in an effort to improve stroke volume. We suspect that
   patient is reliant on atrial kick and would consider cardioversion but
   are holding off on this until her volume status improves.
   - f/u EP recs (consider amio vs. cardioversion)
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired [**Year (4 digits) **] and RV function. We are attempting to aggressively
   diurese her at this time to improve forward flow dynamics.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt and diuril
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u [**Year (4 digits) **] recs
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of [**Year (4 digits) **] function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - restart IV heparin after discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] regarding possible
   line placement
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.4. (Baseline of 0.7). We feel this is
   most likely ATN. The etiology likely being a combination of impaired
   forward flow and possibly contrast nephropathy. We cont to avoid
   nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications.
   - f/u [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   .
   #) UTI: Urine cx from [**7-31**] + for fecal contamination. Will hold off on
   further ABX and recheck a UA/Ucx.
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI), severe 3-vessel disease, and inferior STEMI. She has been transferred to the ICU for revaluation and potential revascularization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxia related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, with a recent CXR showing some improvement. She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen and lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis.
* Cardiac: Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, with a pacer rate increased to 80. The patient is likely reliant on atrial kick and may require cardioversion or amiodarone.
* PUMP: Acute CHF, likely due to impaired left and right ventricular function. The patient is being aggressively diuresed with lasix gtt and diuril, and dopamine is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
* CAD: The patient has had a recent STEMI and is awaiting CT surgery recommendations for CABG and AVR.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine (Cr) remains elevated at 2.4, likely due to a combination of impaired forward flow and contrast nephropathy. Renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
* UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for fecal contamination, and further antibiotics will be held off until a repeat urine analysis (UA) and culture (Ucx) is performed.
* Moderate AS: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis and has been referred to cardiology for potential AVR/CABG.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains stable, and the question of splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has been raised.
* HepC: The patient has hepatitis C, and liver function will need to improve before a repeat liver MRI can be performed.

The patient's code status is full, and she is currently in the CCU. The attending physician has discussed the patient's care with her healthcare proxy and has reviewed the notes of other physicians involved in her care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of CHF and pulmonary edema
* Development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Progression of ARF to acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Sepsis due to UTI or other infections
* Cardiac tamponade or pericarditis
* Hepatic failure due to hepatitis C
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection or sepsis due to central venous catheter or other lines."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI), severe 3-vessel disease, and atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. She was transferred to the ICU for revaluation of options for revascularization. On arrival, she appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Hypoxia: related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, which is being treated with lasix and diuril for diuresis.
* AF with slow ventricular response: the pacer rate has been increased to 80, and cardioversion is being considered once her volume status improves.
* PUMP: the patient is in acute CHF, likely due to impaired left and right ventricular function, and is being treated with diuretics and dopamine to improve forward flow dynamics.
* CAD/s/p STEMI: the patient is awaiting CT surgery recommendations regarding CABG/AVR, and may be amenable to high-risk stenting.
* ARF: the patient has elevated creatinine levels, likely due to ATN, and is being managed with avoidance of nephrotoxins and renally dosed medications.
* Moderate AS: the patient has moderate aortic stenosis, and is awaiting CT surgery recommendations regarding AVR/CABG.
* Thrombocytopenia: the patient's platelet count remains stable, and the question of splenectomy secondary to ITP is being considered.
* HepC: the patient has hepatitis C, and is awaiting liver MRI results to assess the size of known liver lesions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening hypoxia: if the patient's volume overload and pulmonary edema are not effectively managed, she may experience worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient's atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
3. Renal failure: the patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection: the patient's immunocompromised state may increase her risk of infection, particularly urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
5. Bleeding: the patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly if she undergoes invasive procedures or receives anticoagulant therapy.
6. Hepatic decompensation: the patient's hepatitis C may worsen, leading to liver failure or encephalopathy.
7. Cardiovascular instability: the patient's multiple cardiovascular risk factors and acute CHF may increase her risk of cardiovascular instability, including cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac catheterization, and severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was transferred to the ICU with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is being evaluated for options for revascularization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxia related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, with a recent CXR showing some improvement. She is receiving oxygen via non-rebreather and is being weaned as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 92%.
* Cardiac: Atrial fibrillation (AF) with a slow ventricular response, with a pacer rate increased to 80 to improve stroke volume. The patient is reliant on atrial kick and may require cardioversion once her volume status improves.
* Hemodynamic: The patient is in acute congestive heart failure (CHF) with impaired left ventricular function and right ventricular dysfunction. She is being aggressively diuresed to improve forward flow dynamics and is receiving dopamine as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 2.4, likely due to a combination of impaired forward flow and possibly contrast nephropathy. Renally dosed medications are being used, and the patient is being monitored for signs of worsening kidney function.
* Hepatic: The patient has hepatitis C and is awaiting a repeat liver MRI to assess the size of known liver lesions.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 100, and is being monitored for signs of worsening bleeding.
* Infectious: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a positive urine culture for fecal contamination, and antibiotics have been held off pending further testing.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure due to continued volume overload and pulmonary edema
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to the patient's pre-existing AF and impaired left ventricular function
* Worsening renal function due to continued AKI and potential nephrotoxins
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection, including sepsis, due to the patient's pre-existing medical conditions and potential complications
* Liver dysfunction or failure due to hepatitis C and potential liver lesions

The patient's code status is FULL, and she is being cared for in the ICU with continuous monitoring and support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI), severe three-vessel disease, and a high risk for cardiac arrest. She was transferred to the ICU with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has mild pulmonary edema and is being treated with lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis. Her oxygen saturation is in the low 90s on non-rebreather oxygen.
* Cardiac: She has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and is being treated with a pacer. Her cardiac function is impaired, and she is in acute CHF.
* Renal: She has acute kidney injury (ATN) and her creatinine level is elevated at 2.4.
* Gastrointestinal: She has a UTI and a positive urine culture for fecal contamination.
* Hepatic: She has hepatitis C and is awaiting a repeat liver MRI to assess the size of known liver lesions.
* Hematological: She has thrombocytopenia and is being monitored for possible splenectomy.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis
* Monitoring her oxygen saturation and adjusting her oxygen therapy as needed
* Continuing dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 60
* Holding lisinopril and metoprolol
* Restarting IV heparin after discussion with the cardiologist
* Continuing aspirin and lipitor
* Avoiding nephrotoxins and renally dosing all medications
* Monitoring her platelet count and considering splenectomy
* Following up with the hepatologist for further evaluation of her liver disease
* Monitoring her cardiac function and considering cardioversion or amiodarone therapy
* Continuing prophylactic therapy with a PPI and heparin gtt.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of her respiratory status due to continued pulmonary edema
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to her atrial fibrillation and impaired cardiac function
* Progression of her acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease
* Development of further gastrointestinal complications, such as sepsis or perforation
* Worsening of her liver disease due to hepatitis C
* Development of further hematological complications, such as bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65 kg male in the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. He was admitted with acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, and delirium. His current condition is complicated by acute renal failure, alteration in nutrition, and diastolic heart failure.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's urine output has increased from 80-200cc/hr with lasix gtt and diuril 500mg IV BID. His CXR shows improved edema. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 101/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory support includes a non-rebreather mask with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 61.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and his urine output is still limited. Further monitoring and potential adjustment of diuretic therapy may be necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to ventricular arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening. Continuous cardiac monitoring and potential anti-arrhythmic therapy may be necessary to prevent this complication.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is low, indicating potential respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygenation and potential adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary to prevent this complication.
4. Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may progress to sepsis, which could be life-threatening. Close monitoring of his infection and potential adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary to prevent this complication.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which could complicate his recovery. Close monitoring of his nutritional status and potential adjustment of his nutrition plan may be necessary to prevent this complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient experienced a desaturation episode overnight, with an oxygen saturation of 70-80% on the monitor. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed pH 7.45, PaCO2 25, PaO2 61, and oxygen saturation 91%. The patient's chest X-ray showed improved edema.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/53 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's weight has increased to 65 kg from 55.5 kg at admission.

The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total input of 1,067 mL and a total output of 1,560 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 493 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, the patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.4 mg/dL, and the troponin-T level is elevated at 4.05 ng/mL.

The patient is receiving dopamine infusion at 10 mcg/kg/min and diuretic therapy with Lasix and Diuril. The patient's pacer is set to 80 beats per minute.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's desaturation episode and elevated troponin-T level suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings may indicate cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and abnormal ABG findings may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal laboratory results may indicate sepsis.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate kidney injury.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's abnormal blood pressure and heart rate may indicate cardiovascular instability.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and further evaluation to determine the underlying causes of these complications and to develop an appropriate treatment plan."

 DIALYSIS CATHETER - START [**2181-8-3**] 03:30 PM
   - Temp dialysis line placed for CVVH -> initially CVVH started at
   50cc/h, tolerated well and increased to 75cc/h overnight
   - Diuril and Lasix were d/c'd with fluid being removed from CVVH
   - At 8pm pt had 20sec run of NSVT
   - Liver: pt [**Name (NI) 8301**] class A now b/c of improved albumin, HCC still
   possiblity, imaging when [**Name (NI) **] fxn improves
   - UA showed 6 WBC, neg Nitrites, neg bact -> did not tx
   - CXR ""Little change except for slightly lower lung volumes.""
   - Did not give Amio, day nurse was busy and did not give, then later
   CVVH helping and held off on Amio
   - Attempted A-line but unsuccesful
   - Around 3am pt's BP started dropping nadired to 73/40s, decreased CVVH
   to 50cc/h, with some improvement, but eventually had to increase
   dopamine to 20. Since DA was maxed at 20 our next step was to start Neo
   and ordered it but did not need to give, MAPs remained > 55 o DA 20.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Related to volume overload and pulmonary edema (9.5L
   positive LOS) though most recent CXR shows some improvement. She
   continues to sat in the low 90
s on non-rebreather. Most recent  ABG
   7.45/25/61/18
   - cont lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis. Would consider starting UF if
   diuresis becomes less effective
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Pacer rate increased to 80
   yesterday in an effort to improve stroke volume. We suspect that
   patient is reliant on atrial kick and would consider cardioversion but
   are holding off on this until her volume status improves.
   - f/u EP recs (consider amio vs. cardioversion)
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired [**Year (4 digits) **] and RV function. We are attempting to aggressively
   diurese her at this time to improve forward flow dynamics.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt and diuril
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u [**Year (4 digits) **] recs
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of [**Year (4 digits) **] function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - restart IV heparin after discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] regarding possible
   line placement
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.4. (Baseline of 0.7). We feel this is
   most likely ATN. The etiology likely being a combination of impaired
   forward flow and possibly contrast nephropathy. We cont to avoid
   nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications.
   - f/u [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   .
   #) UTI: Urine cx from [**7-31**] + for fecal contamination. Will hold off on
   further ABX and recheck a UA/Ucx.
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) HepC:  Hepatology reviewing OSH liver MRI. She will likely need a
   repeat liver MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] function improves in order to assess whether
   known liver lesions increasing in size.
   - f/u liver recs
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with HCP (daughter [**Name (NI) 8208**]) on [**8-2**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Temp dialysis line placed for CVVH -> initially CVVH started at
   50cc/h, tolerated well and increased to 75cc/h overnight
   - Diuril and Lasix were d/c'd with fluid being removed from CVVH
   - At 8pm pt had 20sec run of NSVT
   - Liver: pt [**Name (NI) 8301**] class A now b/c of improved albumin, HCC still
   possiblity, imaging when [**Name (NI) **] fxn improves
   - UA showed 6 WBC, neg Nitrites, neg bact -> did not tx
   - CXR ""Little change except for slightly lower lung volumes.""
   - Did not give Amio, day nurse was busy and did not give, then later
   CVVH helping and held off on Amio
   - Attempted A-line but unsuccesful
   - Around 3am pt's BP started dropping nadired to 73/40s, decreased CVVH
   to 50cc/h, with some improvement, but eventually had to increase
   dopamine to 20. Since DA was maxed at 20 our next step was to start Neo
   and ordered it but did not need to give, MAPs remained > 55 o DA 20.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac catheterization, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 91/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (IPM)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* White blood cell count: 10.2 K/uL

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has severe pulmonary edema and is requiring oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AF) with slow ventricular response: The patient's AF is being managed with a pacemaker, and cardioversion is being considered once her volume status improves.
3. Pump failure: The patient has acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and is being treated with diuretics, dopamine, and lasix to improve forward flow dynamics.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is being managed with continuous cardiac monitoring.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.4 mg/dL, and the etiology is likely a combination of impaired forward flow and possibly contrast nephropathy.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for fecal contamination, and further antibiotic therapy is being held off until a repeat urine culture is obtained.
7. Moderate aortic stenosis: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis, and cardiac surgery recommendations are pending a hepatology assessment of liver disease.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, and the question of splenectomy secondary to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is being considered.
9. Hepatitis C: The patient has hepatitis C, and liver MRI is being reviewed by hepatology to assess the size of known liver lesions.

The patient's medications include:

* Heparin sodium
* Dopamine
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Fentanyl
* Lasix
* Diuril
* Aspirin
* Lipitor
* Metoprolol
* Lisinopril

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently to remain in the ICU for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Cont to require FM to keep O2 sats >92%. We feel hypoxia
   related to sig volume overload. Attempting to remove fluid with CVVH
   given diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril unsuccessful.
   - cont CVVH
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) Hypotension: Now has increased dopamine requriement to 20mg/hr.
   Hypotension likely related to iniating CVVH.
   - try and wean dopa
   - monitor LEs which appear blue, though cap refill intact
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: We have turned pacer down to 30.
   Native rhythm currently stable. We feel she would benefit from being in
   sinus rhythm but are holding off on cardioversion until we can remove
   more fluid given concern that she would likely revert back to Afib at
   this time if we cardiovert her. We will give her a loading dose of
   amiodarone today. Keep temp wire in while giving amio.
   - f/u EP recs
   - cont heparin gtt
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired renal and RV function. Temnp HD line placed and CVVH
   initiated yesterday.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60, but try to wean
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of renal function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   #) ARF: As noted above, acute renal failure requiring CVVH. Likely this
   is ATN.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) UTI: Repeat UA negative
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss

   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.

   MRI to monitor liver lesions
   - f/u liver recs
   #) Prophylaxis:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2181-8-3**] 03:30 PM
 DIALYSIS CATHETER - START [**2181-8-3**] 03:30 PM
   - Temp dialysis line placed for CVVH -> initially CVVH started at
   50cc/h, tolerated well and increased to 75cc/h overnight
   - Diuril and Lasix were d/c'd with fluid being removed from CVVH
   - At 8pm pt had 20sec run of NSVT
   - Liver: pt [**Name (NI) 8301**] class A now b/c of improved albumin, HCC still
   possiblity, imaging when renal fxn improves
   - UA showed 6 WBC, neg Nitrites, neg bact -> did not tx
   - CXR ""Little change except for slightly lower lung volumes.""
   - Did not give Amio, day nurse was busy and did not give, then later
   CVVH helping and held off on Amio
   - Attempted A-line but unsuccesful
   - Around 3am pt's BP started dropping nadired to 73/40s, decreased CVVH
   to 50cc/h, with some improvement, but eventually had to increase
   dopamine to 20. Since DA was maxed at 20 our next step was to start Neo
   and ordered it but did not need to give, MAPs remained > 55 o DA 20.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac catheterization demonstrating severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF) and is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 91/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General: In normal appearance, oriented x1-2 (person, place), mood and affect appropriate
* HEENT: Normal, sclera anicteric, pupils equal and reactive to light
* Neck: Supple, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)
* Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, faint S2, and ESM and PSM (electrocardiogram) consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF)
* Lungs: Breath sounds diminished at bases with scattered crackles
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM) or tenderness
* Extremities: No lower extremity edema
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* Pulses: Dopplerable, good capillary refill

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 12.6 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 101 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16 mmol/L
* Sodium (Na): 155 mmol/L
* Potassium (K): 4.7 mmol/L
* Chloride (Cl): 98 mmol/L
* Carbon dioxide (CO2): 38.8 mmol/L
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.6 mmol/L
* Troponin-T: 4.05 ng/mL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Hypoxia: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 92%. This may be related to significant volume overload.
* Hypotension: The patient has required an increased dopamine dose to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg, which may be related to initiating CVVH.
* Atrial fibrillation (AF) with slow ventricular response: The patient's native rhythm is currently stable, and the plan is to hold off on cardioversion until more fluid can be removed due to concern that she may revert back to AF.
* Acute cardiac failure (CHF): The patient continues to be in acute CHF, likely due to impaired renal and right ventricular function.
* Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has ARF requiring CVVH, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Urinary tract infection (UTI): Repeat urine analysis has been negative.
* Moderate aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has moderate AS, and the plan is to discuss possible aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the cardiologist.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains stable, and the question of splenectomy secondary to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is being considered.
* Hepatitis C: The patient has hepatitis C, and the plan is to monitor liver lesions with repeat MRI.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation, and proton pump inhibitors.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently critical care unit (CCU) care."

 DIALYSIS CATHETER - START [**2181-8-3**] 03:30 PM
   - Temp dialysis line placed for CVVH -> initially CVVH started at
   50cc/h, tolerated well and increased to 75cc/h overnight
   - Diuril and Lasix were d/c'd with fluid being removed from CVVH
   - At 8pm pt had 20sec run of NSVT
   - Liver: pt [**Name (NI) 8301**] class A now b/c of improved albumin, HCC still
   possiblity, imaging when renal fxn improves
   - UA showed 6 WBC, neg Nitrites, neg bact -> did not tx
   - CXR ""Little change except for slightly lower lung volumes.""
   - Did not give Amio, day nurse was busy and did not give, then later
   CVVH helping and held off on Amio
   - Attempted A-line but unsuccesful
   - Around 3am pt's BP started dropping nadired to 73/40s, decreased CVVH
   to 50cc/h, with some improvement, but eventually had to increase
   dopamine to 20. Since DA was maxed at 20 our next step was to start Neo

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Cont to require FM to keep O2 sats >92%. We feel hypoxia
   related to sig volume overload. Attempting to remove fluid with CVVH
   given diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril unsuccessful.
   - cont CVVH
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) Hypotension: Now has increased dopamine requriement to 20mg/hr.
   Hypotension likely related to iniating CVVH.
   - try and wean dopa
   - monitor LEs which appear blue, though cap refill intact
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: We have turned pacer down to 30.
   Native rhythm currently stable. We feel she would benefit from being in
   sinus rhythm but are holding off on cardioversion until we can remove
   more fluid given concern that she would likely revert back to Afib at
   this time if we cardiovert her. We will give her a loading dose of
   amiodarone today. Keep temp wire in while giving amio.
   - f/u EP recs
   - cont heparin gtt
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired renal and RV function. Temnp HD line placed and CVVH
   initiated yesterday.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60, but try to wean
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of renal function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   #) ARF: As noted above, acute renal failure requiring CVVH. Likely this
   is ATN.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) UTI: Repeat UA negative
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) HepC:  Now Child
s A given improved albumin. Will likely need repeat
   MRI to monitor liver lesions
   - f/u liver recs
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with HCP (daughter [**Name (NI) 8208**]) on [**8-2**])
   .
   #) Dispo: CCU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Cont to require FM to keep O2 sats >92%. We feel hypoxia
   related to sig volume overload. Attempting to remove fluid with CVVH
   given diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril unsuccessful.
   - cont CVVH
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) Hypotension: Now has increased dopamine requriement to 20mg/hr.
   Hypotension likely related to iniating CVVH.
   - try and wean dopa
   - monitor LEs which appear blue, though cap refill intact
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: We have turned pacer down to 30.
   Native rhythm currently stable. We feel she would benefit from being in
   sinus rhythm but are holding off on cardioversion until we can remove
   more fluid given concern that she would likely revert back to Afib at
   this time if we cardiovert her. We will give her a loading dose of
   amiodarone today. Keep temp wire in while giving amio.
   - f/u EP recs
   - cont heparin gtt
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired renal and RV function. Temnp HD line placed and CVVH
   initiated yesterday.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60, but try to wean
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of renal function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   #) ARF: As noted above, acute renal failure requiring CVVH. Likely this
   is ATN.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) UTI: Repeat UA negative
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) HepC:  Now Child
s A given improved albumin. Will likely need repeat
   MRI to monitor liver lesions
   - f/u liver recs
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with HCP (daughter [**Name (NI) 8208**]) on [**8-2**])

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI) with severe 3-vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention. She has been transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.2°C, HR 82 bpm, BP 91/63 mmHg, RR 25 inspirations per minute, SpO2 92%.
* Cardiac: The patient has a paced rhythm, and her cardiac function is compromised due to acute CHF and impaired renal and RV function.
* Respiratory: The patient requires oxygen therapy to maintain an SpO2 >92%.
* Neurological: The patient is oriented to person and place, but her mental status is not otherwise noted.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and dopamine is being administered to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient is receiving CVVH to remove excess fluid, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently being maintained with dopamine, but weaning of this medication may be necessary to avoid hypotension.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is being closely monitored, and she may require continued oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she is at risk for further injury due to her underlying medical conditions.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may be at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and she may be at risk for further liver damage or failure.
6. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and underlying medical conditions make her susceptible to infectious complications, such as sepsis or pneumonia.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuation of CVVH to remove excess fluid
* Administration of dopamine to maintain a MAP >60 mmHg
* Monitoring of the patient's blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and fluid balance
* Closely monitoring the patient's laboratory results, including troponin-T levels and LFTs
* Consultation with cardiology and hepatology to discuss further management options, including revascularization and liver transplantation
* Prophylactic administration of PPI and heparin to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding and deep vein thrombosis, respectively."
