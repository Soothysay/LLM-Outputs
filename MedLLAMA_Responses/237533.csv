You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, and ibuprofen, among others. They have been receiving alteplase (TPA) and heparin infusions, as well as hydralazine, and have been monitored for cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic parameters. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 166/75 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through a non-rebreather mask, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated troponin levels, consistent with a recent myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with heparin and alteplase, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a diagnosis of DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and other complications.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate AKI.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, but there is a risk of hypoglycemia due to the use of insulin and other medications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving respiratory support, and there is a risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of central venous catheters and urinary catheters.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may be at risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting, due to the use of medications and the presence of a nasogastric tube."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of allergies to various medications, including penicillins, aspirin, and ibuprofen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,924 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, overweight/obese, and poor dentition. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, and the respiratory examination reveals symmetric expansion and diminished breath sounds at the bases. The abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, distension, and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound or guarding.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine and troponin-T levels. Other laboratory results include a prolonged PT, PTT, and INR, as well as elevated CK, CKMB, and troponin-T levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's lines include a PICC line inserted on the previous evening.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as the presence of a PICC line, there is a risk of sepsis.
2. DVT: The patient's history of DVT and the presence of a PICC line increase the risk of further thrombotic events.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of DVT and the presence of a PICC line increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's diminished breath sounds at the bases and elevated respiratory rate increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and prolonged PT, PTT, and INR increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient's poor dentition and presence of a PICC line increase the risk of infection.
8. Bleeding Complications: The patient's prolonged PT, PTT, and INR increase the risk of bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  No
   evidence for aspiration at this time.  Low suspicion for MI by history
   but would rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  Question of volume
   overload given h/o diastolic CHF and lying supine for procedure.  CXR
   concerning for possible fluid overload, less likely aspiration.  BNP
   only mildly elevated, r/o with CEs.
   - NRB and wean as tolerated.
   - c/s ABX for possible aspiration given O2 requirements (leukocytosis
   difficult to interpret given recent steroids
 will check diff)
   - autoset CPAP overnight
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Team thought pre-renal complicated by
   slight ATN.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - Continue hydration
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Appears to be sinus tach by ECG.  PE vs. pain vs.
   agitation.
   -          Continue to follow
   -          Management as above
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known nonobstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - continue holding BP meds
   .
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes 100 units glargine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  No
   evidence for aspiration at this time.  Low suspicion for MI by history
   but would rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  Question of volume
   overload given h/o diastolic CHF and lying supine for procedure.  CXR
   concerning for possible fluid overload, less likely aspiration.  BNP
   only mildly elevated, r/o with CEs.
   - NRB and wean as tolerated.
   - c/s ABX for possible aspiration given O2 requirements (leukocytosis
   difficult to interpret given recent steroids
 will check diff)
   - autoset CPAP overnight
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Team thought pre-renal complicated by
   slight ATN.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - Continue hydration
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Appears to be sinus tach by ECG.  PE vs. pain vs.
   agitation.
   -          Continue to follow
   -          Management as above
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known nonobstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - continue holding BP meds
   .
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes 100 units glargine
   qhs
   - HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  Possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history and will
   continue to rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction,
   however abnormalities on CXR appear unilateral.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  PE high-risk given
   clot burden and peri-procedure; aspiration/HAP given body habitus,
   leukocytosis and low grade fever;  CHF less likely given unilateral
   findings on CXR, BNP.
   - check ABG today
   - trial on venti-mask to assess O2 requirements
   - send sputum cxs
   - vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro for HAP/aspiration
   - if can obtain PIV access will perform CTA to investigate PE (would
   require more aggressive anticoagulation) and venogram to investigate
   status of IVC.  If only have PICC access will perform non-contrast CT
   (investigate pulmonary infiltrate) and venogram.
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Likely pre-renal complicated by ATN
   from contrast nephropathy.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   - will add home regimen as BP tolerates
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known non-obstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. Given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - will add BP meds as tolerated
   .
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes 100 units glargine
   qhs
   - HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]
   - start insulin gtt given poor control of BS
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypercoagulability: Appreciate heme-onc rec's, will check factor V
   leiden as per heme-onc.  Do not believe diagnosis of protein C
   deficiency is valid at this time.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Tg 280, LDL 225, CHol 303
   - continue statin

   # FEN: Diabetic diet,IVF, lytes prn
   # Access: PICC, 2 femoral sheaths, will attempt to get PIV access for
   CTA
   # PPx: heparin IV infusion, TPA, no other heparin products at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and pulmonary embolism (PE) with an IVC filter in place. She was transferred to the MICU after experiencing anaphylaxis during a procedure to treat a large IVC thrombosis. The patient is currently receiving TPA and heparin infusions to manage her PE and prevent further clotting.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no acute events overnight. However, she still requires high O2 requirements. Her vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 104 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 166/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no rub or murmurs
* Respiratory: Symmetric lung expansion, diminished breath sounds at the bases
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present, distended, tender in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) without rebound or guarding
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person and place, no sedation or paralysis

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 384 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 217 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* IVC thrombosis with PE
* Hypertension
* Coronary artery disease
* Type 1 diabetes
* Renal failure
* Anemia
* Hypercoagulability
* Hyperlipidemia
* FEN (fatty liver disease)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to PE or aspiration
* Cardiac complications such as acute coronary syndrome or heart failure
* Renal failure progression
* Anemia worsening
* Hypercoagulability complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
* Hyperlipidemia complications such as pancreatitis or atherosclerosis
* FEN complications such as liver failure or pancreatitis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing TPA and heparin infusions to manage PE and prevent further clotting
* Monitoring for respiratory failure and cardiac complications
* Managing renal failure with IV fluids and medications
* Treating anemia with iron replacement and erythropoietin
* Managing hypercoagulability with anticoagulant therapy
* Monitoring for hyperlipidemia complications
* Managing FEN with medications and lifestyle modifications
* Performing a gastric emptying study to evaluate gastroparesis
* Treating RUQ abdominal pain with promethazine and dilaudid as needed
* Monitoring for UTI and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary
* Transitioning to long-term anticoagulation based on CTA results."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 40-year-old woman, is a critical care patient in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of deep venous thrombosis, including an IVC filter clot, and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy. She also has acute renal failure, hypoxemia, and probable obstructive sleep apnea. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as abnormal liver function tests. Her chest X-ray shows increased right base opacity and left base consolidation, which may indicate pneumonia.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including alteplase, heparin, and hydralazine, and has a PICC line inserted. She is also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows consolidation in the right and left bases, which may indicate pneumonia. This could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis and is at risk for PE. This could lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Contrast-Induced Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is at risk for ARF due to her history of kidney disease and the use of contrast agents for imaging studies.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia may be due to hypovolemic shock, PE, or pericardial disease. This could lead to cardiac arrest and death.
5. Sepsis: The patient's hypoxemia and acute renal failure may be due to sepsis. This could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation and increase her risk of complications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 40-year-old woman, is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. Her condition has remained stable over the past 24 hours, with continued hypoxemia and improved dyspnea. She has a history of contrast allergy and has received various medications, including alteplase, heparin, and hydralazine.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 102 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 138/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Overweight/obese
* Normocephalic head
* Normal cardiovascular examination
* Clear breath sounds
* Soft and tender abdomen
* 2+ edema in both lower extremities
* Unable to stand due to discomfort

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.7-15.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 384-371 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5-1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02-0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 215-217 mg/dL

Radiological findings include:

* CXR shows increased right base opacity and left base consolidation

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Marked deep venous thrombosis, including IVC filter clot
* Hypoxemia
* Acute renal failure improving
* Obesity and probable OSA
* Contrast allergy
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prevention
* Code status: Full code
* Disposition: ICU

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Pneumonia due to increased right base opacity and left base consolidation on CXR
* Pulmonary embolism due to deep venous thrombosis
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hypoxemia
* Sepsis due to possible infection
* Cardiac complications due to acute renal failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prevention
* Skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers
* Neurological complications due to prolonged bed rest and immobility

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   # IVC Thrombosis: Patient is s/p TPA by IR with question of anaphylaxis
   manifested tachycardia and hypoxemia.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure vs possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history ruled out
   with serial enzymes.  Stopped heparin ggt through fem catheters once
   power PICC placed.

   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. pulmonary infarct vs. aspiration vs obsesity
   hypoventilation and derecruitment in setting of procedure and
   sedation.  PE high-risk given clot burden and peri-procedure;
   aspiration/HAP given body habitus, leukocytosis and low grade fever;

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, hypertension, and s/p pulmonary embolism (PE) with an IVC filter in place. She was transferred to the MICU for observation after receiving tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) by interventional radiology (IR) for large IVC thrombosis.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. IVC Thrombosis: The patient has a large IVC thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarct, or aspiration.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which may be due to PE, pulmonary infarct, aspiration, or obesity-related hypoventilation and derecruitment.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has baseline creatinine (Cr) 1.1, which may be due to pre-renal azotemia complicated by contrast nephropathy. Renal ultrasound did not show obstruction.
4. RUQ Abdominal Pain: The patient has RUQ abdominal pain, which may be due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive gastritis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to aoctic disease (AOCD) and macrocytosis likely due to low reticulocyte count.
6. CAD: The patient has known non-obstructive CAD on recent catheterization, and chest pain on presentation was likely due to non-acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
7. DM1: The patient has type 1 diabetes, which requires basal insulin and diabetic diet.
8. Hypercoagulability: The patient has a history of hemostasis-oncology recommendations, and factor V Leiden testing is planned.
9. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and beta-blockade in the setting of PE may precipitate hypotension.
10. Treated UTI: The patient has a history of treated UTI, which is resolved.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including:

* Heparin drip with weight-based protocol for IVC thrombosis
* TPA by IR for IVC thrombosis
* Insulin gtt for DM1
* Statin for CAD
* Beta-blocker for hypertension
* PPI for gastritis
* Reglan for promotility
* Amitriptyline for pain
* Ativan for nausea
* PO iron repletion for anemia
* Pan-scan CT for femoral bleed and RP bleed

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 117/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 11.7-16.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.0-26.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 384-375 x 10^9/L

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type I, and acute pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/49 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal limits, and the kidney function tests are normal.

The patient's medical history is significant for type I diabetes, and they are receiving insulin infusion. The patient is also receiving heparin drip for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's pain control is managed with hydromorphone and lorazepam infusions. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% on high-flow nebulization.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypoglycemia due to insulin infusion and diabetes mellitus.
2. Thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, due to immobility and heparin drip.
3. Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
4. Respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to pneumonia or other underlying conditions.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to underlying cardiac conditions.
6. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to hypoglycemia, infection, or cardiac events.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer or other underlying conditions.
8. Renal failure due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or underlying kidney disease.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of diabetes mellitus, type I, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity. They experienced chest pain with T-wave inversion in V1 and V2, which was assessed as non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is receiving heparin drip with weight-based protocol and has been started on insulin for glycemic control. They have a power PICC line in place and are receiving prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/49 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy through a high-flow nebulizer and have a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. They have a mild elevation in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), but their kidney function is otherwise normal. The patient's liver function tests are normal, and their electrolytes are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progression: The patient has a history of DVT in the lower extremity, and their current anticoagulation therapy may not be sufficient to prevent further clot formation.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's DVT and respiratory symptoms increase the risk of PE, which could lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory symptoms and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to cardiovascular instability and death.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's NSTEMI and ongoing chest pain may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest and death.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and lines increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN may indicate kidney injury, which could lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
8. Liver injury: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver injury, which could lead to liver failure and death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient should be treated with antibiotics for any suspected infections, and their anticoagulation therapy should be adjusted as necessary to prevent DVT progression. The patient's respiratory support should be optimized to prevent respiratory failure, and their cardiovascular status should be closely monitored to prevent cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  Possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history and will
   continue to rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction,
   however abnormalities on CXR appear unilateral.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  PE high-risk given
   clot burden and peri-procedure; aspiration/HAP given body habitus,
   leukocytosis and low grade fever;  CHF less likely given unilateral
   findings on CXR, BNP.
   - check ABG today
   - trial on venti-mask to assess O2 requirements
   - send sputum cxs
   - vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro for HAP/aspiration
   - if can obtain PIV access will perform CTA to investigate PE (would
   require more aggressive anticoagulation) and venogram to investigate
   status of IVC.  If only have PICC access will perform non-contrast CT
   (investigate pulmonary infiltrate) and venogram.
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Likely pre-renal complicated by ATN
   from contrast nephropathy.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   - will add home regimen as BP tolerates
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known non-obstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. Given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - will add BP meds as tolerated
   .
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes 100 units glargine
   qhs
   - HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]
   - start insulin gtt given poor control of BS
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypercoagulability: Appreciate heme-onc rec's, will check factor V
   leiden as per heme-onc.  Do not believe diagnosis of protein C
   deficiency is valid at this time.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Tg 280, LDL 225, CHol 303
   - continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Diabetic diet,IVF, lytes prn
   # Access: PICC, 2 femoral sheaths, will attempt to get PIV access for
   CTA
   # PPx: heparin IV infusion, TPA, no other heparin products at this time
   -> will need to transition to long-term anticoagulation based on CTA
   results
   # Code: presumed FULL
   # Dispo: pending above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  Possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history and will
   continue to rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction,
   however abnormalities on CXR appear unilateral.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  PE high-risk given
   clot burden and peri-procedure; aspiration/HAP given body habitus,
   leukocytosis and low grade fever;  CHF less likely given unilateral
   findings on CXR, BNP.
   - check ABG today
   - trial on venti-mask to assess O2 requirements
   - send sputum cxs
   - vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro for HAP/aspiration
   - if can obtain PIV access will perform CTA to investigate PE (would
   require more aggressive anticoagulation) and venogram to investigate
   status of IVC.  If only have PICC access will perform non-contrast CT
   (investigate pulmonary infiltrate) and venogram.
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Likely pre-renal complicated by ATN
   from contrast nephropathy.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   - will add home regimen as BP tolerates
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known non-obstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. Given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - will add BP meds as tolerated
   .
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes 100 units glargine
   qhs
   - HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]
   - start insulin gtt given poor control of BS
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypercoagulability: Appreciate heme-onc rec's, will check factor V
   leiden as per heme-onc.  Do not believe diagnosis of protein C

   unable to get cultures, and try to get sputum (none so far).  Since she
   has known DVT (and therefore will be anticoagulated), and RV is not
   dilated, we have held off on CTA, since she is at higher-than-average

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

    Etiology of hypoxemia remains uncertain.  CXR suggests pneumonia; PE
   is in DDx.  We will complete a course of therapy for HAP x 8 days if
   unable to get cultures, and try to get sputum (none so far).  Since she
   has known DVT (and therefore will be anticoagulated), and RV is not
   dilated, we have held off on CTA, since she is at higher-than-average
   risk for contrast-induced ARF.
   Tachycardia appears to have been mostly hypovolemic based on response

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and other complications.

The patient's 24-hour events include continued hypoxemia, chest pain, and a VBG pCO2 that was reassuring. An EKG was reviewed with cardiology, and an echo showed no RV dilation, no increase in pericardial effusion, and no LV regional wall motion abnormalities.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, Motrin, Tylenol, codeine, Plavix, Percocet, Zofran, Morphine, Optiray, Visipaque, Tramadol, and Ketorolac. She has received antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Aztreonam, and Vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* HR: 92 (83-119) bpm
* BP: 118/45 (62) mmHg
* RR: 15 (11-26) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: bilateral radial and dorsal pedal pulses present
* Respiratory/chest: clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: soft, with continued abdominal discomfort with palpation
* Extremities: bilateral edema
* Skin: warm
* Neurologic: responds to verbal stimuli, with purposeful movement and normal tone

The patient's laboratory results include:

* WBC: 11.7-16.0 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 24.0-26.5%
* Plt: 371-384 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.4-1.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02-0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 73-114 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Marked deep venous thrombosis, including IVC filter clot
* Hypoxemia, improving somewhat
* Probable aspiration pneumonia (vs. pulmonary edema)
* Acute renal failure, improving
* Obesity and probable OSA
* Contrast allergy

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury
* Contrast-induced acute kidney injury
* Venous thromboembolism
* Pulmonary embolism
* Aspiration pneumonia
* Obesity-related complications (e.g., sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome)
* Contrast allergy

The patient's plan includes:

* Completion of a course of therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for 8 days if unable to get cultures
* Attempt to get sputum cultures
* Holding off on computed tomography angiography (CTA) due to risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury
* Continuing insulin gtt for diabetes
* Managing nausea and vomiting
* Monitoring for anemia and bleeding
* Cautiously advancing diet after CT scans
* Providing prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis and stress ulcer
* Monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis: Patient is s/p TPA by IR with question of anaphylaxis
   manifested tachycardia and hypoxemia.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE) with an IVC filter in place. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation after receiving tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for the PE. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has a power PICC line, two femoral sheaths, and a femoral catheter. She has a history of anaphylaxis, and her allergy profile is significant for hives with multiple medications.

The patient's current condition is complicated by hypoxemia, which may be due to multiple small PEs, aspiration pneumonia, or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has a large IVC thrombosis, which was treated with TPA, and is at high risk for developing further thrombotic events.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, likely due to bleeding or blood loss, as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels, consistent with renal failure. She has a history of hypertension, CAD, and hyperlipidemia, and is currently receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation may increase her risk for respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and LDH may indicate ongoing renal failure, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and elevated LDH may indicate bleeding complications, which may require further investigation and treatment.
4. Thrombotic events: The patient's history of PE and IVC thrombosis may increase her risk for further thrombotic events, which may require ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
5. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and possible UTI may increase her risk for infection, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and hypertension may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetic gastroparesis and erosive gastritis may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis: Patient is s/p TPA by IR with question of anaphylaxis
   manifested tachycardia and hypoxemia.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure vs possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history ruled out
   with serial enzymes.  Stopped heparin ggt through fem catheters once
   power PICC placed. IR pulled fem cathethers on [**3-27**] after they
   determined patient would not benefit from additional TPA. Pan scan was
   done which did not show any hematoma or bleed.
   -          [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   -          - will perform venogram (holding for now given ARF
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. pulmonary infarct vs. aspiration vs obsesity
   hypoventilation and derecruitment in setting of procedure and
   sedation.  PE high-risk given clot burden and peri-procedure;
   aspiration/HAP given body habitus, leukocytosis and low grade fever;
   CHF less likely given unilateral findings on CXR, BNP. O2 requirements
   weaned to NC on [**3-27**]. Appears to be worsen in the setting of volume
   overload and pulmonary edema.
   - follow up cx
   - vanc/ Aztreonam /cipro for HAP/aspiration
   - check vanc level tonight
   .
   # Vol overload
 patient has 10L positive since admission and diffuse
   edema and pulmonary edema. Patient takes Lasix 80mg PO daily as
   outpatient and responded well to Lasix 40mg IV X1 overnight [**3-26**].
   -          giving Lasix 40mg IV BID
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Likely pre-renal complicated by ATN
   from contrast nephropathy.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - Renal following, recs no dye load at this time, holding off on
   venogram for now
   - when okay with renal, will give prehydration protocol - IVF's,
   mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis , H. Pylori neg.
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs and reglan for promotility.
   - continue dilaudid prn  pain and ativan for nausea given allergy
   profile
   - Gastritis - treating with PPI daily
   .
   # Anemia: Concerning in the setting of heparin ggt and TPA
   administration and s/p multiple procedures. Pan scan negative, no fem
   hematoma or RP bleed.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - since HCt 21 and possibility of bleeding and dropping Hct,
   transfusing 1u PRBC now
   .
   # CAD: Known non-obstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. Given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative. [**3-25**] EKG with TWI in V1 and V2. Cardiology shown EKG, no ACS.
   On heparin ggt for thrombosis. EKG changes resolved the following day
   and patient did not complain of further chest pain.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - will add BP meds as tolerated
   .
   # DM1:, needs basal insulin. Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes
   100 units glargine qhs, HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]
   Sugars continued to be in 100-150 range while on insulin ggt and
   .
   # Diarrhea
 in the setting of prolonged hospitalization stay
   -          stopping bowel regimen and sending c diff, no precautions
   since low prob
   # Hypercoagulability: Appreciate heme-onc rec's, will check factor V
   leiden as per heme-onc.  Do not believe diagnosis of protein C
   deficiency is valid at this time.
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   - will add home regimen as BP tolerates
   .
   # treated UTI: Treated and resolved.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Tg 280, LDL 225, CHol 303
   - continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Diabetic diet, lytes prn
   # Access: power PICC, 2 femoral sheaths pulled [**3-26**] (atropine at
   bedside during pull in case of vagal response)
   # PPx: heparin ggt for thrombosis, PPI, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, hypertension, and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. She was transferred to the MICU for observation after receiving tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) by interventional radiology (IR).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is experiencing hypoxemia, which is likely due to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure, aspiration PNA on CXR, or obesity hypoventilation and derecruitment in the setting of procedure and sedation.
* Cardiovascular: She has a known non-obstructive CAD on recent catheterization, and her ECG showed changes consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on presentation, which resolved the following day.
* Gastrointestinal: She is experiencing RUQ abdominal pain, likely due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive gastritis, and has a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes.
* Renal: She has baseline creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, which is likely pre-renal complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from contrast nephropathy.
* Hematological: She has anemia, which is concerning in the setting of heparin ggt and TPA administration and multiple procedures.
* Infectious: She has treated UTI, which has resolved, and is at risk for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
* Endocrine: She has poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and requires basal insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence: Given the patient's history of PE and the presence of multiple small PE, there is a risk of recurrence.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which can be life-threatening.
3. Sepsis: The patient's risk factors for sepsis include her recent procedures, antibiotic use, and underlying medical conditions.
4. Renal failure: The patient's pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) may worsen, and she may require dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, and she may require transfusions.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's RUQ abdominal pain and history of gastroparesis and erosive gastritis may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent use of hydralazine may increase her risk of hypertension-related complications.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's recent DVT and IVC filter placement may increase her risk of DVT recurrence.
9. Infection: The patient's risk factors for infection include her recent procedures, antibiotic use, and underlying medical conditions.

In summary, the patient is at risk for multiple complications, including pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, renal failure, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, deep vein thrombosis, and infection. Close monitoring and management of these risks are essential to prevent complications and ensure the patient's safety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a complex medical history, including type I diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic pain, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 118/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 297 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 95 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* Penicillins, aspirin, Motrin, Tylenol, Codeine, Plavix, Percocet, Zofran, Morphine, Optiray, Visipaque, Tramadol, and Ketorolac allergies
* Previous antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and aztreonam
* Current medications, including insulin, heparin, pantoprazole, furosemide, lorazepam, and hydromorphone

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: well-nourished, no acute distress, overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs or rub
* Respiratory: symmetric chest expansion, diminished breath sounds at the bases
* Abdominal: soft, bowel sounds present, distended, tender RUQ with mild guarding
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's DVT and diabetes mellitus
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation
* Cardiovascular instability due to the patient's blood pressure and heart rate
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's abdominal tenderness and distension
* Neurological complications due to the patient's diabetes mellitus and potential hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly."
