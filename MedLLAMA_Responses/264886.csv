 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. pt has CRI and in the setting of
   this his 2 sets of trop has been in the indetermined range with a
   negative ck. this makes an ACS scenario with unstable plaque rupture
   much less likely. he may have stable coronary artery disease with
   demand ischemia at times. We need to obtain his recent cardiac cath
   report from [**Hospital **] to help determine further the extend and amenability
   of it to revascularization. he also has severe AS and although we can
   present his case to the CT surgery i'd imagine he's perhaps not the
   best candidate. short of that we could entertain valvuloplasty as an
   alternative choice of therapy. his language barrier certainly makes it
   challenging in determine whether his symptoms are related to his AS.
   his echo called this severe as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however
   the peak gradient is 39 and mean gradient is 20. whether this is
   secondary to a low output state due to his poor lv function vs genuine
   severe as is unclear at present. i think we have several priorities
   here. 1) optimize medical therapy for his cad and cardiac dysfunction.
   2) further evaluation of ongoing bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further
   evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of
   AS.
   - i don't believe this gentleman is having an ACS and will not
   anticoagulate him at this point. Will continue home regimen of aspirin,
   zocor, lisinopril and metoprolol. his blood pressure and hr are in the
   lower range of normal where it should be.
   - from his lv dysfunction point of view he appears fairly well
   compensated. will continue chf meds of ace-i, beta blocker and standing
   dose lasix.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   .
   #) Pulmonary:
   - pt has mild pan expiratory wheeze. cxr suggestive of pneumonia but
   he's afebrile with a normal wcc.
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:
   - pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in his
   stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:
   - no clot at present. per wife this also started recently. no evidence
   of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   .
   #) Anemia:
   - mcv 90. will do anemia eval.
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - ppi and pneumoboots.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues, including severe aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease, and possible unstable angina/NSTEMI. He was admitted to the ICU with chest pain, which resolved spontaneously, and was found to have bloody stool and hematuria.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has a mild pan-expiratory wheeze on lung examination and a faint systolic murmur on cardiac examination.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated troponin-T and creatine kinase (CK) levels. His cardiac enzymes, including CK-MB and troponin-T, are in the indeterminate range.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Optimization of medical therapy for his coronary artery disease and cardiac dysfunction.
2. Further evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia, and severity of AS.
3. Evaluation of his ongoing bloody stool and hematuria.
4. Consideration of valvuloplasty as an alternative to cardiac surgery.
5. Continued home regimen of aspirin, zocor, lisinopril, and metoprolol.
6. Continued chf meds of ace-i, beta blocker, and standing dose lasix.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) despite the patient's indeterminate cardiac enzymes.
2. Unstable angina/NSTEMI due to severe AS or coronary artery disease.
3. Hemorrhagic complications due to his bleeding stool and hematuria.
4. Cardiac failure due to his poor left ventricular function.
5. Pneumonia due to his mild pan-expiratory wheeze.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to his bloody stool and potential gastrointestinal lesions.
7. Anemia due to his bloody stool and hematuria.
8. Coagulopathy due to his bleeding complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old man admitted to the ICU with complex medical issues, including chest pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and multiple comorbidities. He presented from a nursing facility after taking NTG for chest pain, which resulted in hypotension that resolved spontaneously. His cardiac condition is uncertain, with possible unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe AS, or both. He has mild pan-expiratory wheeze, bloody stool, and hematuria, and is being treated for pneumonia, anemia, and CRI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac condition is uncertain, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications, including unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe AS, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's mild pan-expiratory wheeze and possible pneumonia may lead to respiratory complications, including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bloody stool and hematuria may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or urinary tract bleeding, which can lead to anemia, electrolyte imbalances, or sepsis.
4. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria may be related to Foley trauma during recent admission or may indicate a underlying urinary tract infection or kidney disease.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to chronic blood loss, vitamin deficiency, or underlying medical condition, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. CRI: The patient's CRI may be related to his underlying medical condition, and may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent further complications.
7. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to multi-organ failure, septic shock, or death.
8. Blood Loss: The patient's bloody stool and hematuria may indicate blood loss, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or sepsis.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's multiple comorbidities and medications may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hyperkalemia.
10. Infection: The patient's possible pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis or multi-organ failure."

 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. Mildly elevated trop and flat CK
   in setting of CRI. Unlikely active ACS this makes an ACS scenario with
   unstable plaque rupture much less likely. he may have stable coronary
   artery disease with demand ischemia at times.  ECHO called this severe
   as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak gradient is 39 and
   mean gradient is 20. whether this is secondary to a low output state
   due to his poor lv function vs genuine severe as is unclear at present.
   i think we have several priorities here. 1) optimize medical therapy
   for his cad and cardiac dysfunction. 2) further evaluation of ongoing
   bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further evaluation of his coronary
   anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of AS.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues, including unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe aortic stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with chest pain and was found to have mild hematuria and bloody stool. His labs show elevated troponin and creatine kinase, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia or infarction. He is being treated with aspirin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and spironolactone, and his medical therapy is being optimized to manage his cardiac dysfunction. He has a history of chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine levels are elevated. He is also being treated for possible sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of unstable angina/NSTEMI and severe aortic stenosis puts him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and elevated creatinine levels increase his risk for acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, or end-stage renal disease.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bloody stool and hematuria may be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding or a gastrointestinal source of bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or sepsis.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his current respiratory status put him at risk for further pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
5. Infection: The patient's presence of bloody stool and hematuria increases his risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ dysfunction.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's history of bleeding and his current bleeding status put him at risk for further hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding into the abdominal cavity, retroperitoneal space, or intracranial space.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to experience bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as heart failure, pneumonia, or sepsis.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and his current electrolyte levels put him at risk for electrolyte imbalances, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures."

 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. Mildly elevated trop and flat CK
   in setting of CRI. Unlikely active ACS this makes an ACS scenario with
   unstable plaque rupture much less likely. he may have stable coronary
   artery disease with demand ischemia at times.  ECHO called this severe
   as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak gradient is 39 and
   mean gradient is 20. whether this is secondary to a low output state
   due to his poor lv function vs genuine severe as is unclear at present.
   i think we have several priorities here. 1) optimize medical therapy
   for his cad and cardiac dysfunction. 2) further evaluation of ongoing
   bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further evaluation of his coronary
   anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of AS.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81
   .
   #) Pulmonary: ?retrocardiac opacity
   - will check PA/Lat
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in
   his stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:no clot at present. per wife this also started recently.
   no evidence of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   - consult urology consult.
   #) Anemia: +guaic stool and hematuria
   - mcv 90. will do anemia eval.
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues, including severe aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the ICU with chest pain, which was treated with nitroglycerin, resulting in hypotension. The patient's condition is currently stable, with no chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. His respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a mildly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and a 5-12 mm systolic ejection murmur in the right second intercostal space with radiation to the neck. His lung fields show reduced air entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible myocardial damage. His white blood cell count is 5.3 K/μL, and his hemoglobin is 9.0 g/dL. His platelet count is 342 K/μL, and his creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction
2. Unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both
3. Chronic heart failure (CHF)
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD)
5. Anemia
6. Hematuria
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Optimizing medical therapy for CAD and cardiac dysfunction
2. Further evaluation of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria
3. Further evaluation of coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia, and severity of AS
4. Repeat catheterization with right heart study, as well as possible dobutamine stress echocardiogram
5. Consultation with cardiothoracic surgery
6. Continuation of current medications, including statin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and spironolactone
7. Decrement of aspirin to 81 mg daily
8. Serial hematocrit checks
9. IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis
10. Consultation with gastroenterology and urology services

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications, such as worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction
2. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation
4. Hematuria or acute kidney injury
5. Anemia or bleeding disorders
6. Infection or sepsis
7. Cardiovascular instability or shock

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old man admitted to the ICU with complex medical issues, including unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and possible retrocardiac opacity. He has a history of cardiac disease, including a recent cardiac catheterization showing 3VD with LAD TO, LCx 50%, and RCA 60%. He has also been taking nitroglycerin (NTG) for chest pain, which resulted in hypotension. His current medications include statin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and spironolactone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/42 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals reduced air entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze, and his labs show mild anemia, mild iron deficiency, and elevated troponin-T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Unstable angina/NSTEMI may progress to myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
	* Severe AS may lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, or sudden death.
	* Valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm² indicates severe AS, which may require surgical intervention.
2. Pulmonary Complications:
	* Retrocardiac opacity may be a sign of pneumonia, which could progress to respiratory failure.
	* Reduced air entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze may indicate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Streaked stool may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or inflammatory bowel disease.
	* Unclear if the patient is up-to-date on colon cancer screening, which may increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
4. Hematuria Complications:
	* Foley trauma may lead to urinary tract infection or bleeding.
	* Hematuria may indicate a more serious underlying condition, such as kidney stones or cancer.
5. Anemia Complications:
	* Mild iron deficiency may worsen anemia, leading to fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath.
	* Active type and screen may be necessary to rule out other causes of anemia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

   [**Last Name (STitle) 9310**] on [**2138-7-20**].   I concur with the documentation of the 24
   hour history.  The physical examination is consistent with my
   examination and the assessment and management describe our plans over
   the next 24 hours.  Mr. [**Known lastname 9311**] is an 83 year old man with a history
   of severe CAD and severe aortic stenosis who was hospitalized for
   cardiogenic shock at [**Hospital3 2180**] Medical Center.  Although he
   declined surgery at that junction and was discharged to Kindren LTAC,
   he redeveloped chest pain prompting admission.  He had an episode of
   pain yesterday and we will consult with him and his family to review
   the current options.  He has not shown evidence of an additional NSTEMI
   event.  We will also obtain the recent angiograms from [**Hospital3 2180**]
   Medical Center.   We will continue all measures as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   the next 24 hours.  Mr. [**Known lastname 9311**] is an 83 year old man with a history
   of severe CAD and severe aortic stenosis who was hospitalized for
   cardiogenic shock at [**Hospital3 2180**] Medical Center.  Although he
   declined surgery at that junction and was discharged to Kindren LTAC,
   he redeveloped chest pain prompting admission.  He had an episode of
   pain yesterday and we will consult with him and his family to review
   the current options.  He has not shown evidence of an additional NSTEMI
   event.  We will also obtain the recent angiograms from [**Hospital3 2180**]
   Medical Center.   We will continue all measures as outlined above.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of severe CAD and severe aortic stenosis. He was hospitalized for cardiogenic shock and declined surgery. He was discharged to a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC) but redeveloped chest pain prompting admission.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: The patient has 3VD on recent cath, LAD TO, LCx 50%, and RCA 60%. He has a possible severe AS contributing to his recent chest pain. The plan is to discuss the case with cardiothoracic surgery and consider medical therapy, surgical option, or interventional options.
* Pulmonary: There is a possible retrocardiac opacity on the PA/Lat, but with no WBC or fevers, antibiotics are being held off for now.
* GI: The patient's wife reports streaked stool, and he may not be up-to-date on colon cancer screening. The plan is to monitor his daily Hct, continue IV PPI, and suggest outpatient GI follow-up.
* Hematuria: The patient reportedly began experiencing hematuria prior to admission, which is likely related to foley trauma.
* Anemia: The patient has mild iron deficiency and is being treated with ferrous sulfate.
* CRI: The patient is at baseline.
* DM: The patient's blood sugar is controlled, and he will continue his outpatient Lantus dose and sliding scale.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving PPI and pneumococcal vaccine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac: The patient's severe CAD and AS may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
* Pulmonary: The possible retrocardiac opacity may indicate a pulmonary embolism or other respiratory complications.
* GI: The patient's streaked stool may indicate a gastrointestinal bleed or other GI complications.
* Hematuria: The patient's hematuria may indicate a urinary tract infection or other urological complications.
* Anemia: The patient's mild iron deficiency may worsen if not properly treated.
* CRI: The patient's CRI may lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
* DM: The patient's DM may lead to further complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

The patient's current medications include:

* Statin
* Lisinopril
* Metoprolol
* Spironolactone
* Lasix 40mg PO
* Ferrous sulfate 325mg daily
* Lantus dose and sliding scale for DM
* PPI

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 5.3-6.0 K/uL
* Hct: 26.4-28.6%
* Plt: 285-342 K/uL
* Cr: 1.5-1.7 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.05-0.06 ng/mL
* Glucose: 138-235 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.4 C (97.6 F)
* Tcurrent: 36 C (96.8 F)
* HR: 57 bpm
* BP: 99/42 mmHg
* RR: 23 insp/min
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* GENERAL: appears in no apparent distress
* HEENT: NCAT, sclera anicteric, PERRL, EOMI
* NECK: supple, jvp mildly elevated
* CARDIAC: rrr, nl s1, faint s2, 5-12 ejection systolic murmur in right second intercostal space with radiation to neck

   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: 3VD on recent cath LAD TO, LCx 50%, RCA 60% medical therapy
   vs surgical option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: 3VD on recent cath LAD TO, LCx 50%, RCA 60% medical therapy
   vs surgical option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81
   - recheck EKG
   - avoid NTG with AS.
   # AS
 moderate dz, no delay in carotid upstoke, but loss of A2 . Echo
   called this severe as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak
   gradient is 39 and mean gradient is 20.
   - discuss case with cardiac surgery
   - avoid reducing preload
   #) Pulmonary: ?retrocardiac opacity- current PA/Lat shows possible
   retrocardiac opacity, but with no WBC or fevers decided not to treat.
   - continue to hold off on abx and follow along clinically.
   - follow serial CXRs
   .
   #) GI:pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in
   his stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.  Hct stable
   overnight
   - serial hct check
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:no clot at present. per wife this also started recently.
   no evidence of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   - consult urology consult.
   #) Anemia: Mild iron deficiency.
   - Begin ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary can be made:

The patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues, including unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and potential retrocardiac opacity. He was admitted to the ICU after taking nitroglycerin for chest pain, which resulted in hypotension that resolved spontaneously.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with a recent catheterization showing 3VD, LAD TO, LCx 50%, and RCA 60%. He is being considered for medical therapy, surgical option, or interventional options. His aortic stenosis is moderate to severe, with a valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2 and a peak gradient of 39 and mean gradient of 20.

The patient's pulmonary status is also concerning, with possible retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, but no WBC count or fever. He is being closely monitored and will continue to have serial chest X-rays.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is concerning, with a history of blood streaks in his stool since admission, and a stable hematocrit overnight. He is being treated with IV proton pump inhibitor and will require conservative therapy.

The patient's hematuria is being monitored, with no clot present and no evidence of coagulopathy. He is being followed conservatively and will require a urology consult.

The patient's anemia is mild and iron deficiency is being treated with ferrous sulfate. His diabetes is being managed with outpatient Lantus and sliding scale.

The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: worsening of angina, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure
* Pulmonary complications: worsening of respiratory failure, pneumonia, or respiratory distress syndrome
* Gastrointestinal complications: bleeding, perforation, or obstruction
* Hematuria complications: worsening of bleeding, clotting disorders, or kidney damage
* Anemia complications: worsening of anemia, iron deficiency, or bleeding
* Diabetes complications: worsening of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis

The patient's treatment plan includes continued medical therapy, possible surgical or interventional options, and close monitoring of his cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and hematuria status."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour old ICU admission with a history of OSH (Out-of-Hospital Syncope) prior to catheterization. Current catheterization shows LM clean, LAD TO, LCx 50%, RCA 60%, and LAD collaterals being filled by RCA. The patient's ASA was decreased to 81mg, and PPI was started. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for possible retrocardiac opacity on PA/Lat imaging, which was decided to hold off on antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.4°C, Tcurrent of 36°C, HR of 57 bpm, BP of 99/42 mmHg, RR of 23 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -925 mL, and respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with an SpO2 of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's WBC count has fluctuated, and there is a possibility of infection, which may lead to sepsis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's LAD collaterals being filled by RCA may indicate a cardiac issue, and the patient's chest pain and impaired physical mobility may be related to cardiac complications.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, which may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation. The patient's SpO2 of 96% may indicate a mild hypoxemia.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is -925 mL, which may indicate a significant fluid loss or excess. This may lead to complications such as hypovolemic shock or fluid overload.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutrition is not specified in the note, which may lead to malnutrition or inadequate caloric intake.
6. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels have fluctuated, and there is a possibility of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which may lead to complications.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's platelet count has fluctuated, and there is a possibility of bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
8. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels have fluctuated, and there is a possibility of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has ongoing cardiac issues, with a recent cardiac catheterization showing LM 20%, LAD 60%, and RCA 60% stenosis. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and they have a faint ejection systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space.
* Respiratory: The patient has reduced air entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze, indicating possible respiratory compromise.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 99/42 mmHg, and their heart rate is 57 bpm. They have a mildly elevated jugular venous pressure.
* Laboratory: The patient's white blood cell count is 285 K/uL, with a mild increase in the neutrophil count. Their hemoglobin is 9.3 g/dL, and their platelet count is 342. Their creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL, and their troponin-T is 0.05.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium is 138 mg/dL, potassium is 30 mEq/L, and magnesium is 2.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's significant coronary artery disease, they are at risk for cardiac complications such as acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's reduced air entry and expiratory wheeze may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and mild increase in neutrophils suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent decrease in ascorbic acid (ASA) dose and the presence of a stress ulcer prophylaxis suggest a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
5. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and mild increase in troponin-T suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury or cardiorenal syndrome.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, particularly the potassium and magnesium levels, may indicate the need for close monitoring and potential interventions to prevent cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical history and current condition pose significant risks for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. Mildly elevated trop and flat CK
   in setting of CRI. Unlikely active ACS this makes an ACS scenario with
   unstable plaque rupture much less likely. he may have stable coronary
   artery disease with demand ischemia at times.  ECHO called this severe
   as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak gradient is 39 and
   mean gradient is 20. whether this is secondary to a low output state
   due to his poor lv function vs genuine severe as is unclear at present.
   i think we have several priorities here. 1) optimize medical therapy
   for his cad and cardiac dysfunction. 2) further evaluation of ongoing
   bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further evaluation of his coronary
   anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of AS.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81
   .
   #) Pulmonary: ?retrocardiac opacity
   - will check PA/Lat
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in
   his stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:no clot at present. per wife this also started recently.
   no evidence of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. Mildly elevated trop and flat CK
   in setting of CRI. Unlikely active ACS this makes an ACS scenario with
   unstable plaque rupture much less likely. he may have stable coronary
   artery disease with demand ischemia at times.  ECHO called this severe
   as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak gradient is 39 and
   mean gradient is 20. whether this is secondary to a low output state
   due to his poor lv function vs genuine severe as is unclear at present.
   i think we have several priorities here. 1) optimize medical therapy
   for his cad and cardiac dysfunction. 2) further evaluation of ongoing
   bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further evaluation of his coronary
   anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of AS.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81
   .
   #) Pulmonary: ?retrocardiac opacity
   - will check PA/Lat
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in
   his stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:no clot at present. per wife this also started recently.
   no evidence of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   - consult urology consult.
   #) Anemia: Mild iron deficiency.
   - Begin ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe aortic stenosis, and cardiac dysfunction. He presented with chest pain and hypotension, which resolved spontaneously. His current catheterization report shows left main 20%, left anterior descending 60%, and right coronary artery 60% stenosis. He is currently receiving medical therapy for his CAD and cardiac dysfunction. He has ongoing bloody stool and hematuria, and further evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia, and severity of AS is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Unstable plaque rupture leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
	* Severe aortic stenosis leading to heart failure, cardiac arrest, or sudden death
	* Coronary ischemia leading to myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias
2. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or death
	* Inflammatory bowel disease or gastrointestinal perforation
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased cardiac output, hypovolemia, or nephrotoxic medications
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression due to underlying medical conditions
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia worsening due to ongoing bleeding, bone marrow suppression, or chronic kidney disease
	* Coagulopathy leading to bleeding complications or thrombosis
5. Pulmonary Complications:
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to aspiration or immunosuppression
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to cardiac dysfunction or sepsis
6. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral vasospasm or infarction due to cardiac emboli or hypoperfusion
	* Seizures or encephalopathy due to electrolyte imbalances, medication toxicity, or underlying medical conditions

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor and manage his care to prevent these potential complications and optimize his outcomes."
