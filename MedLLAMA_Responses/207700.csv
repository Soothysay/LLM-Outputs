   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   .
   1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea.  His
   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.
   He is doing well on 2L nasal cannula at this time.  Concern for
   underlying tamponade physiology not likely given stat Echo today
   revealing a resolved pericardial effusion.
   - Plan for each underlying problem as below
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - ABG today
   - F/U Final CXR read
   .
   2. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. New EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia versus
   rate related change.  No acute failure on Echo.
   - Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure tolerance.
   .
   3. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  Given his fluid overload causing hypoxia, the
   plan is for HD/CVVH today.
   - Correct coagulopathy
   - Obtain HD line access
   - Begin CVVH to remove large volumes.
   - Renal recs
   .
   4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 4.0, likely from recent warfarin
   and multiple antibiotic administration given new diagnosis of TB. No
   reason to suspect worsening liver function at this time, although
   multiple meds may cause this in the future.
   - FFP to correct to 1.5 for procedures (such as lines abovE)
   - Vit K 2mg
   .
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   .
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding.
   - F/u further TB testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   .
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and a supratherpeutic INR giving him multiple reasons to
   have hemoptysis.
   - Continue to monitor, correct coagulopathy.
   .
   8. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis. He was transferred to the ICU for urgent dialysis planning and is currently on 2L nasal cannula for oxygen support. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including pulmonary mycobacterial infection, hemoptysis, and diabetes mellitus. He has undergone bronchoscopy and has a supratherapeutic INR, which may be contributing to his hemoptysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen if his fluid overload is not addressed, and he may require more aggressive oxygen therapy or intubation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to sick sinus syndrome or rate-related changes, and may require further evaluation with echocardiography or electrophysiology studies.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if his fluid overload is not addressed, and he may require more aggressive dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR may increase the risk of bleeding, and he may require further correction with fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K.
5. Wegener's granulomatosis: The patient's Wegener's granulomatosis may worsen if his treatment is not optimized, and he may require further evaluation with imaging studies or biopsies.
6. Pulmonary TB: The patient's pulmonary TB may worsen if his treatment is not optimized, and he may require further evaluation with imaging studies or bronchoscopy.
7. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis may worsen if his coagulopathy is not corrected, and he may require further evaluation with bronchoscopy or imaging studies.
8. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may worsen if his blood glucose levels are not controlled, and he may require further evaluation with blood glucose monitoring or insulin therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and optimize his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   .
   1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea.  His
   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.
   He is doing well on 2L nasal cannula at this time.  Concern for
   underlying tamponade physiology not likely given stat Echo today
   revealing a resolved pericardial effusion.
   - Remove excess fluid with CVVH and possible HD
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - ABG f/u to assure adequately oxygenating
   - Incentive spirometer at bedside0
   - F/U Final CXR read
   .
   2. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. New EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia versus
   rate related change.  No acute failure on Echo.
   - Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure tolerance; do
   not give if patient HR <100
   .
   3. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  Given his fluid overload causing hypoxia, the
   plan is for HD/CVVH today.
   - continue to monitor and correct coagulopathy
   - Begin CVVH to remove large volumes.
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 4.0, likely from recent warfarin
   and multiple antibiotic administration given new diagnosis of TB. No
   reason to suspect worsening liver function at this time, although
   multiple meds may cause this in the future.
   - FFP to correct to 1.5 for procedures (such as lines abovE)
   - Vit K 5mg daily for 2 days
   - monitor INR this afternoons
   .
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   .
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding.
   - F/u further TB testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   - ID consult re: treatment course
   .
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and a supratherpeutic INR giving him multiple reasons to
   have hemoptysis.
   - Continue to monitor, correct coagulopathy.
   .
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   .
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots while supratherapeutic
   Access: Peripheral, better access pending

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with Wegener's Granulomatosis, presumed pulmonary TB, and worsening renal failure. He was transferred to the ICU for urgent dialysis planning and is currently on 2L nasal cannula for oxygen support. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including hypoxia, tachycardia, renal failure, coagulopathy, Wegener's Granulomatosis, pulmonary TB, hemoptysis, anemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea may progress to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, requiring more aggressive dialysis therapy or even renal replacement therapy.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications, especially during invasive procedures.
5. Pulmonary TB progression: The patient's pulmonary TB may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or even death.
6. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis may worsen, requiring more aggressive treatment, including bronchoscopic interventions or even surgical interventions.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring more frequent blood transfusions or even erythropoietin therapy.
8. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may worsen, requiring more aggressive insulin therapy or even insulin pump therapy.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, especially in the respiratory and urinary tracts, due to his immunosuppressed state.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, requiring more aggressive nutritional support, including total parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure, worsening renal failure, and acidosis. He has a complex medical history, including Wegener's granulomatosis, pulmonary mycobacteria, bronchiectasis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes, and malignant melanoma.

The patient's current condition is critical, with the following concerns:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is receiving 4L of nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 97%. The plan is to improve respiratory function with CVVH, but there is also a component of hypoventilation due to rapid shallow breathing and V/Q mismatch from atelectasis.
2. Afib with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and diltiazem is to be used as needed.
3. Renal failure: The patient has worsening renal failure, with a creatinine level of 5.0 mg/dL, and is receiving CVVH.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR of 4.0, which may be due to the effects of warfarin and certain medications. Vitamin K has been ordered.
5. Wegener's granulomatosis: The patient is receiving prednisone and cyclophosphamide for this condition.
6. TB: The patient is receiving treatment for MTB (four-drug regimen), pending culture results. The team will determine how long he has been on therapy and when isolation can be discontinued.
7. Hemoptysis: The patient has had multiple episodes of hemoptysis, with possible etiologies including Wegener's granulomatosis, TB, bronchiectasis, coagulopathy, and uremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR could worsen, leading to cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function could lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and hemoptysis could lead to significant bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory failure make him susceptible to nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Malignancy: The patient's history of malignant melanoma and Wegener's granulomatosis increase his risk of developing further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address these complex medical issues and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Hypoxemic resp failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Please see Dr[**Name (NI) 11707**] note from [**12-27**] for details. I reviewed it
   and agree with his note, including assessment and plan.
   84 year old man with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, pulmonary mycobacteria, being treated as MTB. Transferred to
   the ICU for urgent dialysis.  Developed pericardial effusion during his
   hospitalization (since [**12-8**]).
   1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea.  His
   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.
   He is doing well on 2L nasal cannula at this time.  Concern for
   underlying tamponade physiology not likely given stat Echo today
   revealing a resolved pericardial effusion.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old man with a complex medical history, including Wegener's granulomatosis, pulmonary mycobacteria, bronchiectasis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes. He was admitted to the ICU for urgent dialysis and has developed pericardial effusion, which has been resolved. He is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea and is being treated with nasal cannula oxygen. His respiratory status is complicated by fluid overload from renal failure, pulmonary mycobacterial infection, and hemoptysis. He is also at risk for underlying tamponade physiology, but an echocardiogram revealed a resolved pericardial effusion.

The patient has a coagulopathy, with an INR of 4.0, and is receiving vitamin K. He is also being treated for Wegener's granulomatosis with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. He has a history of hemoptysis, which has not recurred in the ICU, and is being treated for possible underlying causes, including Wegener's granulomatosis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by fluid overload, pulmonary mycobacterial infection, and hemoptysis, which may lead to further deterioration.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including hemoptysis, which may worsen his respiratory status.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen with continued fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance, leading to further deterioration in his renal function.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen with continued fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance, leading to further complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase his risk of infection, including pneumonia, which may worsen his respiratory status.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen with continued fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance, leading to further cardiac complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor intake and electrolyte imbalance may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, which may worsen his overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   1. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, thought to be
   multifactorial including renal failure induced volume overload,
   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   This morning the pt was in no distress, satting 97% on NC, and
   subjectively feeling very well.
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - f/u Renal recs: will remove fluids as bp tolerates
   3. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Restart Heparin gtt. Unsure whether pt will need further procedures,
   so hesitant to restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis, admitted to the ICU for urgent dialysis planning. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to remove gross fluid overload. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/51 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support includes a respiratory isolation and daily CXR to assess pulmonary fluid status.

Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure due to worsening Wegener's, which is being managed with CVVH.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary TB infection, which is being managed with oxygen therapy and respiratory isolation.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has intermittent tachycardia, likely due to sick sinus syndrome, which is being managed with Diltiazem.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient has a high CHADS2 score and needs to be anticoagulated, which is being managed with Heparin.
5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status, which is being managed with Prednisone and Cyclophosphamide.
6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial infection, which is being managed with Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol.
7. Hemoptysis: The patient has had hemoptysis in the past and is being monitored for any recurrence.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to multifactorial causes, which is being managed with blood transfusions.
9. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which is being managed with insulin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's tachycardia and sick sinus syndrome increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's respiratory failure and immobilization increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and respiratory failure increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and hemoptysis history increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and respiratory failure increase the risk of infection.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acidosis and renal failure increase the risk of metabolic acidosis.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's renal failure and electrolyte imbalance increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's renal failure and electrolyte imbalance increase the risk of hypocalcemia.
9. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's immunosuppressed state and liver enzymes elevation increase the risk of liver dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea.  His
   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.
   Concern for underlying tamponade physiology not likely given stat Echo
   today revealing a resolved pericardial effusion. He is now satting 97%
   on NC
   - Remove excess fluid with CVVH and possible HD
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - ABG f/u to assure adequately oxygenating
   - Incentive spirometer at bedside
   - Consider repeat CXR tomorrow
   2. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. New EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia versus
   rate related change.  No acute failure on Echo.
   - Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure tolerance; do
   not give if patient HR <100
   3. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  Given his fluid overload causing hypoxia, the
   plan is for HD/CVVH today.
   - continue to monitor and correct coagulopathy
   - Begin CVVH to remove large volumes.
   - f/u Renal recs: will remove fluids as bp tolerates
   4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 1.4 which has trended down from
   peak of 4.0, likely from recent warfarin and multiple antibiotic
   administration given new diagnosis of TB. No reason to suspect
   worsening liver function at this time, although multiple meds may cause
   this in the future.
   - monitor INR this afternoon
   - Got Vitamin K yesterday, will hold off for today unless INR acutely
   rises again
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding.
   - F/u further TB testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   - F/u with ID, who will be in contact regarding changing dosage
   according to
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and a supratherpeutic INR giving him multiple reasons to
   have hemoptysis.
   - Continue to monitor, correct coagulopathy.
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old man with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's Granulomatosis, presumed pulmonary TB, and bronchiectasis. He is currently intubated and on CVVH for fluid overload and acidosis. He has a history of hemoptysis, and his INR is 1.4, which has trended down from a peak of 4.0. He is also receiving treatment for TB and has a supratherapeutic INR. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/51 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease, fluid overload, and acidosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is suspected due to his underlying infections, including pulmonary TB and bronchiectasis. He is at risk of developing septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's INR is 1.4, which is elevated, and he is at risk of bleeding, especially with his history of hemoptysis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to his underlying Wegener's Granulomatosis.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's heart rate is tachycardic, and he is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, or cardiac failure due to his underlying lung disease and acidosis.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis, due to his underlying lung disease and immunosuppressive therapy.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised due to his underlying disease and treatment, and he is at risk of developing malnutrition, which can worsen his overall health.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is at risk of developing hyperglycemia, which can worsen his underlying conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH and monitor the patient's fluid status and acidosis.
2. Continue treatment for TB and Wegener's Granulomatosis, and monitor the patient's response to therapy.
3. Monitor the patient's INR and bleeding risk, and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a nephrologist and pulmonologist to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and Wegener's granulomatosis, who was admitted with acute renal failure and pericarditis. He has also been found to have active tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and is being treated with prednisone, cytoxan, and bactrim for Wegener's and TB. He has also been started on heparin for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula oxygen. His physical examination is notable for bilateral lower extremity edema and decreased peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 5.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 159 mg/dL. His complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 7.0 x 10^9/L and a platelet count of 190 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 22 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 19 IU/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and he is at risk of further kidney damage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is still elevated, and he may require further respiratory support.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to his atrial fibrillation and heparin therapy.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of TB and is at risk of developing further infections.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk of developing further cardiac complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies due to his acute kidney injury and CVVH therapy.
7. Medication side effects: The patient is taking multiple medications, and he may be at risk of developing side effects from these medications."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning.
   His active issues are:
   1. Hypoxia when he was admitted: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic,
   thought to be multifactorial including renal failure induced volume
   overload, pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade
   physiology was not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving
   pericardial effusion.
   This is no longer an acute issue, the pt is satting well on RA and is
   not subjectively dyspneic
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Will touch base with Renal today about whether we can transition to
   IHD. His bp looks like it would tolerate it. He has been getting a lot
   of fluid off by CVVH but still needs quite a bit taken off as he is
   still grossly anasarcatous. If he can go to IHD, he can likely be
   called out to floor.
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's, possibly due to heparin exposure/HIT, CVVH,
   etc. Differential is broad but plts are not at dangerously low level,
   would just keep an eye on it.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   - If it keeps going lower, would get Heme on board.
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Has had several >150 PTT
s with decreases in his rate of heparin
   infusion. Have been decreasing by 100U/hr for each time it
s been
   supraTx, now currently at 1100U/hr but have told nurse to drop the rate
   by 350U/hr if he is supraTx again.
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels
   5. Pulmonary TB: Had positive acid-fast smear, but state lab has now
   confirmed Gen-probe of MTB is negative. AF culture still pending. ID is
   on board. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - renal recs: Goal 1-2 liters negative or more if tolerated. Ended up
   5L negative!-  respiratory isolation
   Other non-active issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   - Current HR in the 70-80
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are increasing. He is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and will need to be transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) if his blood pressure can tolerate it.
2. Dropping platelets: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and the cause is unclear. The differential diagnosis includes drug-related thrombocytopenia, autoimmune-related thrombocytopenia, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
3. Need for anticoagulation: The patient has a high CHADS2 score and will need to be anticoagulated to prevent stroke and systemic embolism.
4. Pulmonary TB: The patient has a positive acid-fast smear, but the state lab has confirmed that the Gen-probe of MTB is negative. The patient is still pending the results of an AF culture.
5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely due to sick sinus syndrome. He is being treated with diltiazem to control his heart rate.
6. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status. He is being treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide.
7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy, pulmonary TB, and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons to have hemoptysis. He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to multifactorial causes, including blood loss during HD placement and inadequate iron stores.
9. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is being treated with subcutaneous insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and he may need to be transitioned to IHD if his blood pressure can tolerate it.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient has a positive acid-fast smear and is pending the results of an AF culture. He is also at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a high CHADS2 score and is at risk for developing cardiovascular complications, including stroke and systemic embolism.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has bronchiectasis and pulmonary TB, which may lead to respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of hemoptysis and is at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding and perforation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of Wegener's Granulomatosis, which may lead to neurological complications, including seizures and stroke.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current medical issues, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning.
   His active issues are:
   1. Hypoxia when he was admitted: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic,
   thought to be multifactorial including renal failure induced volume
   overload, pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade
   physiology was not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving
   pericardial effusion.
   This is no longer an acute issue, the pt is satting well on RA and is
   not subjectively dyspneic
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Will touch base with Renal today about whether we can transition to
   IHD. His bp looks like it would tolerate it. He has been getting a lot
   of fluid off by CVVH but still needs quite a bit taken off as he is
   still grossly anasarcatous. If he can go to IHD, he can likely be
   called out to floor.
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's, possibly due to heparin exposure/HIT, CVVH,
   etc. Differential is broad but plts are not at dangerously low level,
   would just keep an eye on it.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   - If it keeps going lower, would get Heme on board.
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Has had several >150 PTT
s with decreases in his rate of heparin
   infusion. Have been decreasing by 100U/hr for each time it
s been
   supraTx, now currently at 1100U/hr but have told nurse to drop the rate
   by 350U/hr if he is supraTx again.
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels
   5. Pulmonary TB: Had positive acid-fast smear, but state lab has now
   confirmed Gen-probe of MTB is negative. AF culture still pending. ID is
   on board. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - renal recs: Goal 1-2 liters negative or more if tolerated. Ended up
   5L negative!-  respiratory isolation
   Other non-active issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   - Current HR in the 70-80
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   not subjectively dyspneic
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Will touch base with Renal today about whether we can transition to
   IHD. His bp looks like it would tolerate it. He has been getting a lot
   of fluid off by CVVH but still needs quite a bit taken off as he is
   still grossly anasarcatous. If he can go to IHD, he can likely be
   called out to floor.
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's, possibly due to heparin exposure/HIT, CVVH,
   etc. Differential is broad but plts are not at dangerously low level,
   would just keep an eye on it.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   - If it keeps going lower, would get Heme on board.
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Has had several >150 PTT
s with decreases in his rate of heparin
   infusion. Have been decreasing by 100U/hr for each time it
s been
   supraTx, now currently at 1100U/hr but have told nurse to drop the rate
   by 350U/hr if he is supraTx again.
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels
   5. Pulmonary TB: Had positive acid-fast smear, but state lab has now
   confirmed Gen-probe of MTB is negative. AF culture still pending. ID is
   on board. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - renal recs: Goal 1-2 liters negative or more if tolerated. Ended up
   5L negative!-  respiratory isolation
   Other non-active issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   - Current HR in the 70-80
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his PTT has been above 150 three times, indicating ongoing bleeding complications. CVVH is being continued to remove fluid overload, but the patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may worsen his bleeding risk.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's PTT has been above 150, indicating prolonged bleeding time. He has also had multiple episodes of hemoptysis, which may be related to his pulmonary TB or Wegener's Granulomatosis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, and his bleeding risk is increasing. He has been receiving heparin, which may be contributing to his thrombocytopenia.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of pulmonary TB and Wegener's Granulomatosis, which may lead to further respiratory complications, such as ARDS or pulmonary hemorrhage.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of sick sinus syndrome, intermittent AFib, and bradycardia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of pulmonary TB and Wegener's Granulomatosis, which may lead to further infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of Wegener's Granulomatosis, which may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
8. Anemia: The patient has received 2 units of PRBC yesterday and may require further transfusions due to ongoing blood loss.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is receiving insulin, but his blood glucose levels may not be well-controlled, leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Continue CVVH to remove fluid overload and improve renal function.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and platelet count, and consider adjusting his anticoagulation therapy or platelet transfusions as necessary.
3. Closely monitor the patient's pulmonary function and watch for signs of respiratory failure or ARDS.
4. Closely monitor the patient's cardiovascular function and watch for signs of cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Closely monitor the patient's infection risk and watch for signs of sepsis or pneumonia.
6. Closely monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and watch for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and transfusion needs.
8. Closely monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust his insulin therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   1. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, thought to be
   multifactorial including renal failure induced volume overload,
   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   This morning the pt was in no distress, satting 97% on NC, and
   subjectively feeling very well.
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - f/u Renal recs: will remove fluids as bp tolerates
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Restart Heparin gtt. Unsure whether pt will need further procedures,
   so hesitant to restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   3. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   -  respiratory isolation
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   1. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, thought to be
   multifactorial including renal failure induced volume overload,
   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   This morning the pt was in no distress, satting 97% on NC, and
   subjectively feeling very well.
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - f/u Renal recs: will remove fluids as bp tolerates
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Restart Heparin gtt. Unsure whether pt will need further procedures,
   so hesitant to restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   3. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   -  respiratory isolation
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis. He has acute on chronic renal failure, fluid overload, and pulmonary TB infection. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is being monitored for potential complications. The patient has a history of sick sinus syndrome, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia, and is at risk for anticoagulation-related bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's history of sick sinus syndrome and intermittent atrial fibrillation, combined with his current anticoagulation therapy, puts him at risk for bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's pulmonary TB infection and immunosuppressive therapy increase his risk of developing secondary infections.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of sick sinus syndrome and intermittent atrial fibrillation increases his risk of cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening cardiac events.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hemoptysis and his current anticoagulation therapy put him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and pulmonary TB infection increase his risk of developing respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening respiratory events.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of Wegener's granulomatosis and his current immunosuppressive therapy increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral vasculitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH to remove fluid overload and improve renal function.
2. Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider daily chest X-rays to assess pulmonary fluid status.
4. Consider restarting Coumadin or alternative anticoagulation therapy once the patient's INR is stable.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further cardiac testing if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.
8. Consider daily neurological assessments to monitor for potential neurological complications.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
10. Consider daily multidisciplinary rounds to ensure comprehensive care and coordination of therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with renal Wegener's disease, bronchiectasis, and acute renal failure (ARF) on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). He has a history of allergies to simvastatin and pravastatin, as well as elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 131/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right lower extremity edema: 3+
* Left lower extremity edema: 3+
* Unable to stand
* Warm, no rash on the skin
* Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal commands, but unable to assess movement, tone, or sensation

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.5-8.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 104-137 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.4-3.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 15-26.5 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 133-137 mmol/L, potassium 2.4-5.0 mmol/L, magnesium 2.1-2.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 1.6-2.1 mg/dL
* Liver function tests: elevated ALT and AST
* Coagulation studies: prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) on heparin

The patient is on various medications, including:

* Antibiotics (infusions and oral)
* Anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., pantoprazole)
* Anticoagulants (heparin)
* Cardiovascular medications (e.g., digoxin)
* Antihypertensive medications (e.g., lisinopril)
* Pain management medications (e.g., fentanyl)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Infection (due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines)
* Bleeding (due to prolonged PTT on heparin)
* Renal failure (ARF) worsening
* Respiratory failure (due to bronchiectasis and potential pneumonia)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (due to atrial fibrillation)
* Hypovolemic shock (due to fluid imbalance)
* Electrolyte imbalances (due to ongoing diuresis and electrolyte losses)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Renal failure, acute (ARF): to be managed with CVVH and potentially convert to hemodialysis (HD)
* AFB in sputum: awaiting gene probe results for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
* Atrial fibrillation: to be managed with heparin, with plans to decrease dose due to high PTT
* ICU care: to include ongoing monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and medication administration.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize his clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning.
   Active issues at this point:
   1. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, thought to be
   multifactorial including renal failure induced volume overload,
   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   Pt is now satting well on RA and not subjectively dyspneic.
   - Has now had 6L removed by CVVH and will stop per renal recs as below
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Spoke with renal attndg this am who recommends stopping CVVH as he
   felt too much was taken off yesterday (6L). He wanted to stop [**Hospital 11753**]
   transfer to floor, and if more HD was needed, could do IHD. Continue to
   watch BUN/Cr and UOP.
   - Will stop CVVH
   3. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Continue on Heparin gtt but will decrease by 350U/hr if PTT
   continue to be elevated, instead of the 100U/hr that the rate had been
   being decreased
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   4. ID: State labs Gen-probe negative for TB, and per ID MAC would be
   most likely if TB negative.
   - F/u with ID today. They had recommended that if state results are
   negative, would stop RIPE and just continue INH for latent TB (?).
   - will wait to see ID recs specifically before stopping these meds.
   - Per ID, no need to change ABx on CVVH
   - Continue respiratory precautions until then
   Other less active/stable issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   6. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line
   Code:  Full (confirmed with patient)
   Communication: Patient and wife [**Name (NI) 6046**] [**Name (NI) 11687**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11688**]
   Disposition: Stop CVVH and call out to floor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Continue on Heparin gtt but will decrease by 350U/hr if PTT
   continue to be elevated, instead of the 100U/hr that the rate had been
   being decreased
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   4. ID: State labs Gen-probe negative for TB, and per ID MAC would be
   most likely if TB negative.
   - F/u with ID today. They had recommended that if state results are
   negative, would stop RIPE and just continue INH for latent TB (?).
   - will wait to see ID recs specifically before stopping these meds.
   - Per ID, no need to change ABx on CVVH
   - Continue respiratory precautions until then
   Other less active/stable issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   6. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line
   Code:  Full (confirmed with patient)
   Communication: Patient and wife [**Name (NI) 6046**] [**Name (NI) 11687**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11688**]
   Disposition: Stop CVVH and call out to floor<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis. He was admitted to the ICU for urgent dialysis planning and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). His active issues include hypoxia, renal failure, and need for anticoagulation due to a high CHADS2 score. He has a history of sick sinus syndrome, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. His INR is currently 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He has also had hemoptysis in the past and is at risk for further episodes.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 17 mg/dL
* Acidosis with a pH of 7.44 and a bicarbonate level of 16 mmol/L
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL
* Elevated liver enzymes with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 22 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 19 IU/L
* Elevated troponin-T level of 0.12 ng/mL
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 77 IU/L
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 215 IU/L

Potential medical complications:

* Worsening renal failure and acidosis
* Pulmonary complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the patient's history of pulmonary TB and Wegener's granulomatosis
* Hemoptysis, which may be related to the patient's bronchiectasis, pulmonary TB, and supratherapeutic INR
* Ischemia or infarction due to the patient's history of sick sinus syndrome and intermittent atrial fibrillation
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of hemoptysis
* Anemia, which may be multifactorial and require further evaluation and management
* Diabetes mellitus, which may require further evaluation and management.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's active issues include hypoxia, renal failure, and need for anticoagulation. The plan is to stop CVVH and transfer the patient to the floor, pending further evaluation and management of his renal failure and acidosis. The patient will also require further evaluation and management of his pulmonary TB and Wegener's granulomatosis. The patient's anemia will require further evaluation and management, and he will need to be closely monitored for bleeding complications due to his supratherapeutic INR."
