   in the setting of seeing her basement flooded. ECG did show findings
   concerning for STEMI, with ST elevations in the lateral leads. CK was
   negative at the OSH, and troponin was elevated at 0.45 (troponin i).
   Repeat troponin here was 0.62. The patient is s/p cath, where she had
   stenting of the distal LAD performed. The pt had some slight
   non-specific chest discomfort on arrival to the CCU. This has resolved
   and not recurred.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain, who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes concerning for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and atorvastatin.

Physical examination reveals a well-appearing patient with a systolic ejection murmur noted at the right upper sternal border. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 beats per minute and blood pressure of 94/46 mmHg. Respiratory support is being provided with nasal cannula oxygen at 2 liters per minute.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury. Other lab results include a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 244 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Heart failure: Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, she is at risk for developing heart failure, particularly with the recent STEMI.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient's ECG shows a sinus rhythm, but she is at risk for developing arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, given her age and cardiac history.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infections, given her prolonged hospitalization and recent cardiac catheterization.
4. Blood clots: The patient is at risk for developing blood clots, particularly deep vein thrombosis, given her recent surgery and immobility.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes puts her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with the use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, but she is at risk for developing respiratory failure, particularly with the use of oxygen therapy and potential respiratory infections.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, particularly with the use of central lines and urinary catheters, and given her prolonged hospitalization.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman who presented with chest pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes concerning for a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 58 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 56-73 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/46 mmHg with a range of 90/42-130/79 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (insp/min) with a range of 11-24 insp/min
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 39.1%
* Platelet count: 244 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.62 ng/mL
* Glucose: 188 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers, such as troponin-T and CK-MB, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Alert and oriented, with a normal mental status
* Head and neck: Normal cranial nerves, with no abnormalities
* Cardiovascular: Systolic ejection murmur noted at the right upper sternal border, with no signs of heart failure
* Pulmonary: Unlabored breathing, with slight bibasilar crackles
* Abdomen: Obese, with a soft and non-tender abdomen
* Extremities: No signs of peripheral edema or weakness

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of STEMI and PCI may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and her current oxygen saturation of 96% may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Infectious complications: The patient's history of diabetes and her current use of antibiotics may increase her risk of infectious complications, such as sepsis or urinary tract infections.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of hypertension and her current use of antihypertensive medications may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
5. Renal complications: The patient's history of kidney disease and her current use of diuretics may increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and her current use of antacids may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Based on this information, the patient's current medical condition is stable, but she is at risk for various complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic back/knee pain who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes concerning for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient's condition has been stable, with resolution of her chest discomfort, and she is currently normotensive. She is receiving anticoagulation therapy, aspirin, and clopidogrel, and her medication regimen is being managed to prevent complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent Chest Pain: The patient's cardiac catheterization and PCI have resolved her acute coronary syndrome, but she may still experience recurrent chest pain due to residual stenosis or other cardiac issues.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac catheterization and PCI may have caused cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which could worsen her condition.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and PCI may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and lines may increase her risk of infection, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
5. Sepsis: The patient's chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, may increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diabetes and chronic back/knee pain may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastroparesis or bowel obstruction.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's diabetes and hypertension may increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or possible mid/distal wraparound LAD infarction. The patient's condition is stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and acute coronary syndrome, and is currently receiving cardiac/heart-healthy nutrition and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 39.1%
* Platelet count: 244 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.62 ng/mL
* Glucose: 188 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition
* Sepsis or infection due to the patient's compromised immune system
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying cardiopulmonary condition
* Renal failure due to the patient's underlying diabetes and cardiac condition
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to the patient's immobility and underlying cardiac condition

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and to adjust their treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, an 89-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain, was admitted to the ICU with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and PCI, with stenting of the distal LAD performed. The patient developed sudden onset of SSCP this morning, with ECG showing findings concerning for STEMI. Troponin was elevated at 0.62, and repeat troponin was 0.62. The patient's condition has been stable, with resolution of chest discomfort and no recurrence.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 105/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 244 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.62 ng/mL
* Glucose: 188 mg/dL

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Aspirin
* Plavix
* Metoprolol
* High-dose statin
* Tele
* Prophylactic anticoagulation with SQ UF Heparin
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue ASA and Plavix
* Titrate metoprolol up as needed to keep heart rate in the 60's
* Continue high-dose statin
* Follow serial cardiac biomarkers
* Perform ECG and TTE to assess for systolic dysfunction
* Restart hyzaar when able to confirm home dose
* Continue to trend BP's
* Hold oral hypoglycemics and cover with SSI while in house
* Acetaminophen PRN for pain control

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's diabetes and chronic back/knee pain
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's age and underlying medical conditions
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's recent cardiac catheterization and PCI
* Infection due to the patient's central lines and other invasive devices
* Bleeding due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy
* Hypoglycemia due to the patient's insulin therapy
* Hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes and insulin therapy
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's recent cardiac event and underlying medical conditions."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain, who presented with sudden onset of chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal LAD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.8°C, Tcurrent 36.7°C, HR 64 bpm, BP 105/54 mmHg, RR 13 breaths/min, SpO2 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, with a systolic ejection murmur noted on cardiac examination
* Respiratory support: No oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation is required
* Labs: Troponin T 0.62 ng/mL, CK 67 IU/L, CKMB 14 IU/L, WBC 9.3 K/μL, Hct 39.1%, Plt 244 K/μL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL
* Physical examination: General: alert and oriented, HEENT: normal, CARDIAC: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, LUNGS: resp unlabored, ABDOMEN: soft, EXTREMITIES: no c/c/e

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Heart failure: given the patient's systolic dysfunction and history of hypertension
	+ Arrhythmias: given the patient's sinus rhythm and history of hypertension
	+ Myocardial infarction: given the patient's recent PCI and history of hypertension
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Pneumonia: given the patient's recent hospitalization and history of chronic lung disease
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): given the patient's recent PCI and history of hypertension
* Neurological complications:
	+ Stroke: given the patient's history of hypertension and recent PCI
	+ Seizures: given the patient's history of hypertension and recent PCI
* Gastrointestinal complications:
	+ Gastrointestinal bleeding: given the patient's history of hypertension and recent PCI
	+ Nausea and vomiting: given the patient's history of diabetes and recent PCI
* Infection:
	+ Sepsis: given the patient's history of hypertension and recent PCI
	+ Bacteremia: given the patient's history of hypertension and recent PCI

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's cardiac biomarkers, ECG, and TTE to assess for any changes in cardiac function. The patient should also be closely monitored for any signs of cardiac complications, respiratory complications, neurological complications, gastrointestinal complications, and infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 89-year-old female who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal LAD. Her troponin levels have been trending down, and she reports nonspecific chest discomfort while walking yesterday that spontaneously resolved.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 105/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border, with no rales or wheezing in the lungs.

Laboratory results include:

* Complete blood count (CBC): WBC 9.3, Hct 39.1, Plt 244
* Electrolytes: Na 140, K 4.1, Cl 117, CO2 36.8
* Troponin-T: 0.62
* Glucose: 188

The patient's medications include:

* Aspirin
* Plavix
* Metoprolol
* High-dose statin
* Tele
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue ASA and Plavix
* Titrate metoprolol to keep HR in the 60's
* Continue high-dose statin
* Continue tele
* PT consult
* Stress test this afternoon to assess for any other coronary ischemia

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, or encephalopathy
* Renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease
* Infection complications such as sepsis or septic shock
* Hemorrhagic complications such as bleeding or hematemesis
* Gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain
* Endocrine complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain who presented to the ICU with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and PCI with stenting of the distal LAD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 64 bpm, blood pressure 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 97%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 9.3 K/uL, Hct 39.1%, Plt 244 K/uL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, TropT 0.62 ng/mL, and Glucose 188 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is alert and oriented, with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted at the right upper sternal border. No rales or rhonchi were appreciated in the lungs, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.
* Medications: The patient is receiving ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, and a high-dose statin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections, due to her compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of STEMI and recent PCI with stenting of the distal LAD puts her at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's rising creatinine levels and history of intrinsic renal disease increase her risk for developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of chronic back/knee pain and recent PCI may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and bleeding.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of chronic back/knee pain and recent PCI may increase her risk for neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings. Additionally, the patient's medications should be carefully managed to prevent adverse effects and optimize her cardiac and renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old diabetic woman with hypertension who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and PCI with stenting of the distal LAD. Her troponin levels are trending down, and she reports nonspecific chest discomfort while walking, which resolved spontaneously. She also reports anginal symptoms at home associated with stress, but the story is unclear.

Potential medical complications:

1. Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) or mid/distal wraparound LAD infarction, which may lead to further cardiac damage or arrhythmias.
2. Coronary ischemia, which may be exacerbated by stress or physical activity.
3. Hypotension, which may be exacerbated by vasodilation or decreased cardiac output.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, due to prolonged ICU stay and potential for nosocomial infections.
5. Neurological complications, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack, due to cardiac embolism or hypoperfusion.
6. Renal insufficiency or failure, due to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bleeding, due to stress ulcer prophylaxis or medications.
8. Infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), due to prolonged ICU stay and potential for nosocomial infections.
9. Poor glycemic control, which may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
10. Decreased mobility and increased risk of pressure ulcers, due to prolonged ICU stay and potential for immobility.

Recommendations:

1. Continue stress test this afternoon to assess for any other coronary ischemia.
2. Monitor cardiac troponin levels to assess for any further cardiac damage or infarction.
3. Continue ASA, Plavix, and metoprolol as prescribed.
4. Monitor blood pressure and adjust medications as necessary to maintain normotension.
5. Monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin sliding scale as necessary to maintain euglycemia.
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory or neurological complications and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications and adjust therapy accordingly.
8. Monitor for signs of infections and adjust therapy accordingly.
9. Consider PT consult to assess for any potential bleeding complications.
10. Consider transfer to the floor once the patient's condition stabilizes and they are no longer requiring ICU-level care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back and knee pain. She was admitted to the ICU with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows focal severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal third of the left ventricle, consistent with stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) or mid/distal wraparound LAD infarction. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 35-40%.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of cardiac failure or lung disease.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak value of 0.45 ng/mL. Her white blood cell count is 9.3 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 244 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 39.6 mL/min.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes and elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac ischemia or infarction. She may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiac death.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure or pneumonia.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may be at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she may be at risk for infection.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient has undergone PCI with stenting, and she may be at risk for bleeding complications.
6. Medication-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers, and she may be at risk for medication-related adverse effects."
