   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 One bcx culture yesterday positive for GPCs, started
   vanco.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family  regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - likely place CVL for pressor support
   - continue aggressive IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: No further episodes of diarrhea.
   Gastroenterology plans EGD today, will update them  regarding
   hemodynamic instability.  Stool cultures, c. diff toxin pending.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fugating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), but could be
   other cause including mesenteric ischemia, PUD.  Plan was EGD this am.
   Hct increased appropriately after 1U PRBC yesterday.  Stable since,
   even increased this am, despite fluid resusciation.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   - PIV x 2
   - Transfuse for goal Hct of 30
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets to LN.  Will still plan on formal family meeting to
   discuss long term goals of care beyond line placement, most importantly
   in the short term, code status.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care, including code status
   # Recurrent UTI: Patient s/p ureterostomy for bladder cancer in [**2166**]
   leading to frequent UTI's due to various pathogens, most frequently E.
   Coli, resistant to Cipro/Bactrim/Gent/Unasyn. A U/A on admission was
   positive for occasional bacteria & moderate leukocytes. A urine culture
   is pending. Given modest U/A, UTI is an unlikely source of infection on
   this admission.
   - F/U Ucx
   - Treat if positive
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.3. Unknown etiology of CKD, but may be [**1-4**] h/o bilateral
   hydronephrosis.  At his baseline.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Per OMR. Patient on no medications at home.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   vanco.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family  regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - likely place CVL for pressor support
   - continue aggressive IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: No further episodes of diarrhea.
   Gastroenterology plans EGD today, will update them  regarding
   hemodynamic instability.  Stool cultures, c. diff toxin pending.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fugating mass seen on ERCP at St. E

   Hct increased appropriately after 1U PRBC yesterday.  Stable since,
   even increased this am, despite fluid resusciation.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old Russian-speaking man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, who presents to the ICU with septic shock, hypotension, tachycardia, and two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). He has a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, and has been started on vancomycin. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors. The family is undecided about placing a central venous line (CVL) and an arterial line (A-line).

The patient has also had episodes of diarrhea, rectal pain, and leukocytosis, and has been diagnosed with a GI bleed and iron deficiency anemia. He has a history of multiple malignancies, including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, and has a report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at outside hospital and a CT torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, and has been on dialysis in the past. He also has a history of dementia, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is unstable, and he is at risk for further deterioration due to sepsis.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may lead to cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and history of multiple malignancies make him at risk for further infection.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's CKD and potential nephrotoxicity from medications may lead to further renal failure.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of OSA and potential respiratory compromise due to sepsis may lead to respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension, CKD, and potential cardiac compromise due to sepsis may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of dementia and potential neurological compromise due to sepsis may lead to further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors to manage the patient's septic shock.
2. Consider placing a CVL and A-line to provide further monitoring and support.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungals to manage the patient's infection.
4. Monitor the patient's GI bleed and consider endoscopy to evaluate the extent of the bleeding.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider cardiac monitoring if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider neurological consultation if necessary.
9. Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's goals of care and code status.
10. Consider a formal family meeting to discuss the patient's long-term goals of care beyond line placement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Septic Shock
 One bcx culture yesterday positive for GPCs, started
   vanc.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - if family thinks it is consistent with his wishes, place CVL for
   pressor support

   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - stop vanc

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old Russian-speaking man, is a complex case with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, and recent outside hospitalization with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypotension, tachycardia, and two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). He has a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and has been treated with vancomycin, linezolid, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with progressive tachycardia and hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and pressors. He has also had episodes of diarrhea, rectal pain, and leukocytosis. The patient's family is undecided about placing a central venous line (CVL) and arterial line (a-line).

The patient's lab results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His imaging studies show pneumobilia with a CBD stent, thickening of the duodenum, pancreas, and rectum, as well as large hypodense lesions in the liver and mesentery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and positive blood culture for GPCs suggest a high risk of sepsis.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's bibasilar atelectasis on CXR and possible pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed and iron deficiency anemia suggest a high risk of further bleeding.
5. Malignancy: The patient's history of multiple malignancies and recent diagnosis of metastatic disease suggest a high risk of further progression of disease.
6. Kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease and possible bilateral hydronephrosis may lead to further kidney damage.
7. Dementia: The patient's dementia may affect his ability to make informed decisions about his care.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase his risk of cardiovascular disease.
9. OSA: The patient's OSA may increase his risk of respiratory failure.
10. UTI: The patient's history of recurrent UTIs and positive urine culture suggest a high risk of further UTIs.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors to manage the patient's hypotension and tachycardia.
2. Repeat blood cultures to monitor for further sepsis.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
4. Consider placing a CVL and a-line to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and provide further support.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Consider gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis and monitor the patient's stool output.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider further management for chronic kidney disease.
8. Consider further management for dementia, including cognitive therapy and behavioral interventions.
9. Consider further management for hyperlipidemia, including statin therapy and lifestyle modifications.
10. Consider further management for OSA, including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and lifestyle modifications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only, and pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for enterococcus, sensitivities pending.
   Now on linezolid for suspected VRE, also on cipro/flagyl to cover
   other  enteric sources given presentation of diarrhea.  Consistently
   febrile, worsening leukocytosis.
   - IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro, flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   - repeat blood cultures
   # SVT
 Persistent episodes of SVT.  Given discussion of goals of care,
   it is unclear whether continued treatment of SVT is appropriate.  Will
   continue to treat while on telemetry while in ICU, but we will
   readdress this with the family today.  If we call him out, we can send
   him out without telemetry, with the plan not to interene for SVT.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.  EGD deferred given goals of care.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets .  Given extent of disease, prognosis poor.  Patient made
   CMO yesterday by family.
   - CMO
   - pain control prn
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Low serum bicarbonate: Likely non anion gap metabolic acidosis  from
   diarrhea &/or IVF.  Also possible lactic acidosis component given
   septic shock, though no AG.  Stable since admission.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.2, at baseline.  No change in management.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM
   #. Goals of care: DNR/DNI, treat with antibiotics, IVF.  d/w family re:
   treatment for SVT.  Will treat with adenosine for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 Persistent episodes of SVT.  Given discussion of goals of care,
   it is unclear whether continued treatment of SVT is appropriate.  Will
   continue to treat while on telemetry while in ICU, but we will
   readdress this with the family today.  If we call him out, we can send

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, and recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypotension, and tachycardia, and was found to have positive blood cultures for Enterococcus. He is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasopressors, and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasopressors. Failure to treat sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease increases his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and hypertension increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea and history of gastrointestinal malignancies increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
5. Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and history of malignancies increase his risk of infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of dementia and chronic kidney disease increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's history of anemia and chronic kidney disease increase his risk of hematological complications, such as bleeding disorders and thrombocytopenia.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and history of hypertension increase his risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, and end-stage renal disease.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only, and pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for enterococcus, sensitivities pending.
   Now on linezolid for suspected VRE, also on cipro/flagyl to cover
   other  enteric sources given presentation of diarrhea.  Consistently
   febrile, worsening leukocytosis.
   - IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro, flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   - repeat blood cultures
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: Likely infectious.  EGD was
   planned for yesterday but cancelled in light of hemodynamic
   instability.  Given family discussion, we will defer EGD for now.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, who presented to the hospital with diarrhea, septic shock, and tachycardia. He was admitted to the ICU and received fluid boluses, antibiotics, and vasopressors. His blood cultures grew Enterococcus, and he was started on linezolid for suspected VRE. He also received ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to cover other enteric sources. His condition has been complicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue to worsen if not properly managed, leading to multi-organ failure and increased mortality.
2. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and fever suggest an ongoing infectious process, which may not be fully covered by his current antibiotic regimen.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate inadequate perfusion of vital organs, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's worsening leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response, which may exacerbate his sepsis and other complications.
5. GI Bleed: The patient's history of GI bleeding and iron deficiency anemia may increase his risk of further bleeding, particularly if his malignancy is not well-controlled.
6. Malignancy: The patient's extensive malignancy with unknown primary may lead to further complications, including metastases, organ failure, and poor prognosis.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular complications.
8. Dementia: The patient's dementia may increase his risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications, particularly if he is not properly cared for.
9. OSA: The patient's OSA may increase his risk of respiratory complications, particularly if he is not properly managed.
10. Poor Prognosis: The patient's extensive malignancy and poor prognosis may lead to a high risk of mortality, particularly if his condition is not properly managed."

Summary:

The patient was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and diarrhea. They have been receiving antibiotics, IV fluids, and other medications. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's vital signs have been stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm and blood pressure of 88/51 mmHg. The patient has been noted to be in sinus tachycardia, with a temperature of 38.2°C. They have received 6,841 mL of fluids, including 5,611 mL of IV fluids and 1,230 mL of PO fluids.

The patient's lab results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 17.9 K/uL and a C-reactive protein of 29.9%. The patient's blood cultures have grown Enterococcus, and they are pending for MRSA and other pathogens.

The patient's medical history is significant for no known drug allergies. They have received antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea may be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may be a sign of medication side effects or a underlying medical condition, which can lead to bowel obstruction and other complications.
4. Fever: The patient's fever may be a sign of infection, which can lead to sepsis and other complications.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of cardiac instability, which can lead to arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has received a large amount of fluids, which can lead to fluid overload and other complications.
7. Bloodstream infections: The patient's blood cultures have grown Enterococcus, which can lead to bloodstream infections and other complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, but they may be at risk for respiratory failure if their oxygen requirements increase.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unclear, and they may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or brain edema.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unclear, and they may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 One bcx culture yesterday positive for GPCs, started
   vanc.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - if family thinks it is consistent with his wishes, place CVL for
   pressor support
   - continue aggressive IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - stop vanc
   - follow up blood cultures
   - family meeting re: goals of care
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: No further episodes of diarrhea.
   Gastroenterology plans EGD today, will update them  regarding
   hemodynamic instability.  Stool cultures, c. diff toxin pending.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fugating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), but could be
   other cause including mesenteric ischemia, PUD.  Plan was EGD this am.
   Hct increased appropriately after 1U PRBC yesterday.  Stable since,
   even increased this am, despite fluid resusciation.
   - hold EGD
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   - PIV x 2
   - Transfuse for goal Hct of 30
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets to LN.  Will still plan on formal family meeting to
   discuss long term goals of care beyond line placement, most importantly
   in the short term, code status.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care, including code status
   # Recurrent UTI: Patient s/p ureterostomy for bladder cancer in [**2166**]
   leading to frequent UTI's due to various pathogens, most frequently E.
   Coli, resistant to Cipro/Bactrim/Gent/Unasyn. A U/A on admission was
   positive for occasional bacteria & moderate leukocytes. A urine culture
   is pending. Given modest U/A, UTI is an unlikely source of infection on
   this admission.
   - F/U Ucx
   - Treat if positive
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.3. Unknown etiology of CKD, but may be [**1-4**] h/o bilateral
   hydronephrosis.  At his baseline.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Per OMR. Patient on no medications at home.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 One bcx culture yesterday positive for GPCs, started
   vanc.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - if family thinks it is consistent with his wishes, place CVL for
   pressor support
   - continue aggressive IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - stop vanc
   - follow up blood cultures
   - family meeting re: goals of care
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: No further episodes of diarrhea.
   Gastroenterology plans EGD today, will update them  regarding
   hemodynamic instability.  Stool cultures, c. diff toxin pending.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fugating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), but could be
   other cause including mesenteric ischemia, PUD.  Plan was EGD this am.
   Hct increased appropriately after 1U PRBC yesterday.  Stable since,
   even increased this am, despite fluid resusciation.
   - hold EGD
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   - PIV x 2
   - Transfuse for goal Hct of 30
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets to LN.  Will still plan on formal family meeting to
   discuss long term goals of care beyond line placement, most importantly
   in the short term, code status.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care, including code status
   # Recurrent UTI: Patient s/p ureterostomy for bladder cancer in [**2166**]
   leading to frequent UTI's due to various pathogens, most frequently E.
   Coli, resistant to Cipro/Bactrim/Gent/Unasyn. A U/A on admission was
   positive for occasional bacteria & moderate leukocytes. A urine culture
   is pending. Given modest U/A, UTI is an unlikely source of infection on
   this admission.
   - F/U Ucx
   - Treat if positive
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.3. Unknown etiology of CKD, but may be [**1-4**] h/o bilateral
   hydronephrosis.  At his baseline.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Per OMR. Patient on no medications at home.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only, and pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for enterococcus, sensitivities pending.
   Now on linezolid for suspected VRE, also on cipro/flagyl to cover
   other  enteric sources given presentation of diarrhea.  Consistently
   febrile, worsening leukocytosis.
   - IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro, flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   - repeat blood cultures
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: Likely infectious.  EGD was
   planned for yesterday but cancelled in light of hemodynamic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old Russian-speaking man, was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, diarrhea, and a history of multiple malignancies. He was treated with antibiotics and IV fluids, and his blood cultures grew Enterococcus. He is currently on linezolid for suspected VRE and cipro/flagyl to cover other enteric sources. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of SVT and hypotension. His family has made a CMO decision, and he is currently receiving comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's condition is unstable, and he is at risk of further deterioration due to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Infection: The patient's blood cultures grew Enterococcus, and he is at risk of developing further infections, particularly given his history of multiple malignancies.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and rectal pain may indicate a gastrointestinal bleed, which could worsen his condition.
4. Malignancy: The patient's history of multiple malignancies and the presence of a fungating mass on ERCP suggest a poor prognosis.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline Cr levels were 1.2-1.4, and his current Cr level is 1.2. He may be at risk of further kidney damage or deterioration.
6. Lactic acidosis: The patient's septic shock and diarrhea may lead to lactic acidosis, which could worsen his condition.
7. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and his current condition may lead to further complications, such as cardiac issues.
8. Dementia: The patient's dementia may affect his ability to respond to medical treatment and may require additional care and support.
9. OSA: The patient's OSA may worsen his condition and require additional treatment.
10. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to further complications, such as cardiac issues or respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis and enterococcus infection. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/52 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 95% and no oxygen therapy required. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure or seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of sepsis is a significant risk factor for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and other complications.
2. Enterococcus infection: The patient's enterococcus infection can lead to bacteremia, sepsis, and endocarditis if not adequately treated.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient's stool culture is pending, but the presence of C. difficile can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.
4. E. coli infection: The patient's E. coli culture is pending, but the presence of E. coli can lead to urinary tract infections, sepsis, and kidney damage.
5. Bloodstream infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the presence of a bloodstream infection can lead to sepsis, bacteremia, and endocarditis.
6. Kidney damage: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage from sepsis or antibiotic therapy.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, indicating potential liver damage from sepsis or antibiotic therapy.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are elevated, indicating potential coagulopathy from sepsis or liver dysfunction.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, indicating potential electrolyte imbalance from sepsis, kidney damage, or liver dysfunction.
10. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the presence of sepsis or pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
3. Consider adding a second antibiotic to cover potential bacterial pathogens.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider imaging studies if necessary.
6. Consider adding a coagulation disorder treatment if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider correcting any imbalances.
8. Consider adding a liver support therapy if necessary.
9. Consider adding a kidney support therapy if necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   +enterococcus Bcx.  On admission, had episodes of
   hypotension/tachycardia and two episodes of SVT, now resolved.
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only; pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for pan sensitive enterococcus, ampicillin
   started yesterday afternoon and linezolid d/cd.  Continues on
   cipro/flagyl to cover other  possible enteric sources given
   presentation of diarrhea. Worsening leukocytosis, but afebrile
   overnight.  LFTs have trended down.
   - IV hydration.
   - continue ampicillin, cipro. Given that he is cdiff negative, if
   concern for anaerobes is low, could consider d/cing flagyl.
   - follow up blood cultures.
   - follow up final stool culture.
   # SVT
 Persistent episodes of SVT.  Given discussion with the family
   on [**2-9**], they would like us to continue to intervene with adenosine for
   SVT.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.  EGD deferred given goals of care.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets .  Given extent of disease, prognosis poor.  Patient made
   CMO [**2-8**] by family.
   - CMO
   - pain control prn
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Low serum bicarbonate: Likely non anion gap metabolic acidosis  from
   diarrhea &/or IVF.  Also possible lactic acidosis component given
   septic shock, though no AG.  Stable since admission.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.4, at baseline.  No change in management.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM
   #. Goals of care: DNR/DNI, treat with antibiotics, IVF, adenosine for
   SVT.

   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   +enterococcus Bcx.  On admission, had episodes of
   hypotension/tachycardia and two episodes of SVT, now resolved.
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only; pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for pan sensitive enterococcus, ampicillin
   started yesterday afternoon and linezolid d/cd.  Continues on

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is an 80-year-old Russian-speaking man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, HTN, and CKD, who presented to the hospital with diarrhea and was diagnosed with pan-sensitive enterococcus.
* The patient has been treated with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, and his septic shock has been managed without the use of pressors or central access.
* He has experienced episodes of SVT, which are being managed with adenosine.
* The patient has a history of malignancy, including a fungating mass seen on ERCP, and has a poor prognosis.
* He has a chronic kidney disease, and his serum bicarbonate level is low, likely due to diarrhea and/or IVF.
* The patient has dementia and requires 24-hour assistance with all of his activities of daily living (ADLs).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying conditions and the presence of pan-sensitive enterococcus.
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including SVT, which may require further management and monitoring.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia, which may be related to the patient's malignancy and poor prognosis.
* Chronic kidney disease, which may require ongoing management and monitoring.
* Dementia, which may require ongoing care and assistance with ADLs.
* OSA, which may require further evaluation and management.

Given the patient's poor prognosis and the goals of care discussed with the family, it is essential to focus on symptom management and comfort care, including pain control, hydration, and nutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent metastatic colon cancer,  HTN & CKD
   who presented with 2 days of diarrhea and admitted with hypotension and
   SVT. Found to have an enterococcus bacteremia; hypotension resolved
   with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics and adenosine tx for 2
   episodes of SVT.
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only; pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for pan sensitive enterococcus, ampicillin
   started yesterday afternoon and linezolid d/cd.  Continues on
   cipro/flagyl to cover other  possible enteric sources given
   presentation of diarrhea. Worsening leukocytosis, but afebrile
   overnight.  LFTs have trended down.
   - IV hydration.
   - Per ID recs, ampicilin switched to Zosyn today, continue cipro. Given
   that he is cdiff negative and low concern for anaerobes will d/c
   flagyl.
   - follow up blood cultures.
   - follow up final stool culture.
   # SVT
 Persistent episodes of SVT.  Given discussion with the family
   on [**2-9**], they would like us to continue to intervene with adenosine for
   SVT.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.  EGD deferred given goals of care.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets .  Given extent of disease, prognosis poor.  Patient made
   DNR/DNI [**2-8**] by family.
   - pain control prn
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Low serum bicarbonate: Likely non anion gap metabolic acidosis  from
   diarrhea &/or IVF.  Also possible lactic acidosis component given
   septic shock, though no AG.  Stable since admission.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.4, at baseline.  No change in management.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM
   #. Goals of care: DNR/DNI, treat with antibiotics, IVF, adenosine for
   SVT.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old Russian-speaking man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent metastatic colon cancer, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with hypotension and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was found to have an enterococcus bacteremia. He was treated with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and his hypotension resolved. However, he continues to experience episodes of SVT and is being managed with adenosine.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening leukocytosis, but he is afebrile overnight. His liver function tests (LFTs) have trended down. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia, which is likely secondary to his malignancy.

The patient has been made DNR/DNI by his family, and his goals of care are to treat his sepsis with antibiotics and IV fluids, manage his SVT with adenosine, and provide pain control as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's enterococcus bacteremia and worsening leukocytosis put him at risk for sepsis. His current management plan includes antibiotics and IV fluids, but he may require additional treatment if his condition deteriorates.
2. SVT: The patient's persistent episodes of SVT may require further management, including the use of additional antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia puts him at risk for further bleeding complications.
4. Malignancy progression: The patient's extensive cancer burden and poor prognosis make him at risk for further disease progression and complications.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to his sepsis and other medical complications.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen due to his underlying medical condition and treatment.
7. OSA: The patient's history of OSA may worsen due to his underlying medical condition and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and adjust his management plan as necessary.
2. Consider further management of the patient's SVT, including the use of additional antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
3. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia.
4. Consider palliative care consultation to help manage the patient's symptoms and improve his quality of life.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic kidney disease and adjust his management plan as necessary.
6. Consider cognitive and behavioral interventions to help manage the patient's dementia.
7. Clarify the patient's use of CPAP at home and consider further management of his OSA."
