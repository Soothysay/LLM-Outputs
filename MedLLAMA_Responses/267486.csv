You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a primary diagnosis of asthma. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has refused laboratory tests and medications, including antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 119/62 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 90%. The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula, and their ABG results are pending.

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to their refusal to cooperate. The patient's peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and laboratory results are not assessable. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, terbutaline, epinephrine, glucocorticoids, and iodine, and is taking oral metaproterenol sulfate (Alupent) and prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's refusal to receive antibiotics and laboratory tests increases the risk of developing a serious infection, which could worsen their condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's asthma and respiratory support may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac instability, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
4. Delirium: The patient's history of confusion and delirium may worsen if not addressed, leading to increased risk of falls, injury, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's refusal to eat and receive nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which could compromise their immune system and worsen their condition.
6. DVT and VAP: The patient's immobility and respiratory support increase their risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness and respiratory support may lead to stress ulcer bleeding, which could worsen their condition.

Recommendations:

1. Re-evaluate the patient's need for antibiotics and laboratory tests, and consider alternative treatments if necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, particularly their cardiac and respiratory status.
3. Implement measures to prevent delirium, such as reorienting the patient and providing a calm environment.
4. Ensure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition, and consider alternative methods of feeding if necessary.
5. Implement prophylactic measures to prevent DVT and VAP, such as compression stockings and antibiotics.
6. Monitor the patient's stress ulcer risk and consider prophylactic treatment if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist or intensivist to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - S/p solumedrol in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] order for short course of prednisone 60mg
   daily.  Pt reports h/o psychosis associated with this and refused at
   OSH but this was not noted on most recent d/c summary for COPD
   exacerbationin 6/[**2122**]. (currently refusing).
   - Continue short course of levofloxacin (currently refusing, although
   yesterday stated he feels he has PNA)
   - Incentive spirometry; consider flutter valve
   - Monitor tele, trend CE, repeat EKG in AM (refused labs this AM)
   - Ambulatory sats
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative
   - S/p 2L IVF in ED w/o improvement
   - Avoid albuterol nebs in favor of xopenex
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC
   - CUrrently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   - Trend Cr
   - Repeat U/A
   - Renal u/s with dopplers
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   - FSG qid with HISS
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - CE with AM labs (refused 2^nd set)
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, ?due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges
   - SW consult
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Peripherals.
   # Communication: Patient.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient). HCP 1 is wife [**Name (NI) 384**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12168**].  HCP 2 cousin [**Name (NI) 4526**] [**Name (NI) 12169**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12170**].

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, dCHF, and CAD, who was admitted to the ICU with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH. He has been refusing labs, medications, and providing information about his medical history and pharmacy contacts. He has a history of noncompliance with medical treatment and has been on multiple medications, including prednisone, albuterol, and oxycodone.

Current issues:

1. Hypoxia/dyspnea: The patient's COPD exacerbation is the most likely cause of his hypoxia and dyspnea.
2. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, with components from dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's neutrophil predominant leukocytosis is likely due to prednisone, although review of OSH labs shows bands.
4. ARF: The patient's FeNa 0.4% suggests a prerenal etiology, and he has been receiving 2L IVF in ED.
5. H/o glucose intolerance: The patient is receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation and should have his glucose levels monitored.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of multiple MIs and is not currently on a beta blocker, which may be due to his severe COPD.
7. CHF: The patient has been receiving 2L IV fluids in ED and appears euvolemic currently.
8. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms.
9. Pain control: The patient is reporting chronic pain on oxycodone and may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms.
10. Noncompliance: The patient has a history of noncompliance with medical treatment and has been refusing medications and labs.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and hypoxia increase his risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and history of CAD increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and tachycardia increase his risk of sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ARF and history of CAD increase his risk of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and tachycardia increase his risk of infection.
6. Anxiety and withdrawal: The patient's anxiety and history of substance abuse increase his risk of withdrawal symptoms.
7. Pain control issues: The patient's chronic pain and history of substance abuse increase his risk of pain control issues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and bronchodilators as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
3. Consider adding antibiotics if the patient's leukocytosis persists.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting his fluid status accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider consulting a pain management specialist to help manage the patient's chronic pain.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's anxiety and consider consulting a mental health specialist if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's medication regimen and adjust as needed to prevent overdose or withdrawal."

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, dCHF, and CAD, who was admitted to the ICU with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after signing out AMA from the emergency department. He has refused labs, all medications, and is non-compliant with his treatment plan. The patient has a history of non-compliance and has been prescribed multiple medications, including steroids, beta blockers, and opioids. He is currently receiving IV fluids and oxygen therapy, and has been prescribed solumedrol, levofloxacin, and xopenex.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. COPD exacerbation: The patient's persistent dyspnea and hypoxia may indicate a COPD exacerbation, which could lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's history of CAD and recent tachycardia may indicate cardiac ischemia, which could lead to myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
3. Dehydration: The patient's tachycardia and tachypnea may indicate dehydration, which could lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's history of ARF and current treatment with IV fluids may indicate ongoing renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and neutrophil predominance may indicate an infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Substance withdrawal: The patient's history of opioid use and recent withdrawal may lead to withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, and seizures.
7. Anxiety and agitation: The patient's history of anxiety and recent agitation may indicate a baseline anxiety disorder, which could be exacerbated by withdrawal or other medical conditions.
8. Pain control: The patient's history of chronic pain and recent use of opioids may indicate a need for ongoing pain management, which could be complicated by his non-compliance and history of AMA discharges.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require careful monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, and noncompliance. He is currently in the ICU due to persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after being discharged from the emergency department (ED) against medical advice (AMA).

The patient is refusing to take his medications, including steroids, antibiotics, and bronchodilators, which are likely contributing to his ongoing respiratory distress. He is also refusing to provide information about his home medications or contact information for his primary care physician (PCP).

The patient's physical examination is notable for coarse breath sounds, diffuse wheezes, and mild diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/62 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, likely due to prednisone, but no evidence of infection. His creatinine level is elevated, suggesting prerenal azotemia. He has a history of glucose intolerance and is receiving steroids for his COPD exacerbation.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. COPD exacerbation with hypoxia and dyspnea
2. Dehydration
3. Leukocytosis
4. Prerenal azotemia
5. History of CAD with multiple MIs
6. History of dCHF
7. Anxiety
8. Glucose intolerance
9. Noncompliance with medical treatment

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia
2. Cardiac ischemia
3. Arrhythmia
4. Sepsis
5. Respiratory failure
6. Renal failure
7. Glucose control issues
8. Anxiety exacerbation
9. Noncompliance with medical treatment

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued treatment with bronchodilators and steroids
2. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
3. Repeat EKG and cardiac enzymes
4. Trending of creatinine level
5. Renal ultrasound with dopplers
6. Hold of home medications, including lisinopril and lasix
7. Renal dosing of medications
8. Avoidance of nephrotoxins
9. Nephrology follow-up through PCP
10. Pain control management
11. Anxiety management
12. Code status: Full (discussed with patient)

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement, with a plan for PT consult."

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, decompensated heart failure, and coronary artery disease, who presented to the hospital with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia. He was previously treated at an outside hospital (OSH) for a COPD exacerbation, but refused to provide information about his home medications and pharmacy contact details. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is receiving treatment for his condition, including oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids. He is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including dyspnea, hypoxia, and coarse breath sounds, are consistent with a possible COPD exacerbation, but the lack of fever, consolidation on CXR, and absence of overt pneumonia on the CXR suggest that pneumonia is unlikely.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's history of CAD and chest pain, along with the absence of ischemic changes on EKG, suggest that cardiac ischemia is possible, but not likely given the patient's low risk by Wells' Criteria.
3. Dehydration: The patient's tachycardia and tachypnea may be related to dehydration, which could worsen his underlying conditions.
4. Substance Withdrawal: The patient's history of oxycodone use and the possibility of overuse at OSH raise concerns about substance withdrawal, which could contribute to his symptoms.
5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety and agitation may be related to his underlying conditions, but could also be exacerbated by withdrawal from albuterol nebs.
6. UTI: The patient's history of urinary retention and the absence of overt UTI on U/A suggest that UTI is possible, but not likely.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, and could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
8. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and the possibility of underlying infection could lead to complications such as sepsis and organ failure.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with severe COPD, multiple exacerbations, and a history of noncompliance. He presented to the hospital with a COPD exacerbation and was initially admitted to the ICU. He refused all medications, including steroids, and left against medical advice (AMA) on [**4-12**]. He was readmitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have new renal failure (Cr=2.0). The patient has been intermittently refusing his prednisone, blood draws, and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 94 bpm (80-113)
* Blood pressure: 119/62 mmHg (75-136/71-84)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 93%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Overweight/obese appearance
* Diffuse upper airway wheezing
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm skin
* Attentive and follows simple commands

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 439
* Hemoglobin: 2.5
* Platelet count: 25
* Sodium: 5.0
* Potassium: 68
* Chloride: 101
* BUN: 139
* Creatinine: 40.5
* Glucose: 16.7

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory distress: continue steroids and nebs
* Neurologic complaints/difficulty walking: consider workup
* Tachycardia: improved
* Acute renal failure: unclear where this is compared to his baseline
* Chronic diastolic CHF: no pulmonary edema currently

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia due to the patient's COPD and recent antibiotic use
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's respiratory failure
* Sepsis due to the patient's renal failure and potential urinary tract infection
* Worsening of chronic diastolic CHF
* Development of pulmonary edema due to the patient's chronic heart failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state."

 ASTHMA
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 and taper
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - trend cardiac enzymes, repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative
   - S/p 2L IVF in ED w/o improvement
   - Avoid albuterol nebs in favor of xopenex
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC
   - Currently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   - Trend Cr
   - Repeat U/A
   - Renal u/s with dopplers
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   - FSG qid with HISS
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - CE with AM labs (refused 2^nd set)
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, ?due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges
   - SW consult
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/diabetic diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (dCHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU due to persistent dyspnea and hypoxia. His condition is complicated by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has required 2L of IV fluids in the emergency department (ED). The patient has a history of non-compliance with medication and has been prescribed steroids for his COPD exacerbation. He is also taking medications for his CAD, including aspirin, and has a history of multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute
* Blood pressure of 123/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula
* Coarse bilateral bronchial sounds with diffuse wheezes
* Mild diffuse tenderness in the abdomen
* Intention tremor in both arms

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count with a predominant neutrophil count
* Elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL
* Low serum potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L
* Low serum sodium level of 135 mEq/L

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of COPD and the presence of coarse bilateral bronchial sounds, pneumonia is a possible complication.
* Cardiac ischemia: The patient's history of CAD and the presence of sinus tachycardia make cardiac ischemia a possible complication.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest acute kidney injury, which may be due to prerenal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute make respiratory failure a possible complication.
* Septic shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and low serum sodium level make septic shock a possible complication.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of CAD and the presence of peripheral edema make DVT a possible complication.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation of 93%
* Monitor the patient's respiratory rate and lung sounds
* Continue IV fluids to maintain euvolemia
* Monitor the patient's creatinine and BUN levels to assess for acute kidney injury
* Consider a Swan-Ganz catheter to monitor cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressure
* Consider a stress test to assess for cardiac ischemia
* Consider a chest X-ray to assess for pneumonia
* Consider a CT scan to assess for DVT
* Consider a nephrology consult to assess for acute kidney injury
* Consider a cardiology consult to assess for cardiac ischemia
* Consider a pulmonary consult to assess for respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION
 ASTHMA
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 (day 1 = [**4-14**], continue for 7 days, then
   taper over 7 days)
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin (day 1 = [**4-13**] for empiric course of 5 days)
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - trend cardiac enzymes, repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative. Now resolving.
   - S/p 2L IVF in ED w/o improvement
   - Avoid albuterol nebs in favor of xopenex
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC
   - Currently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   - Trend Cr
   - Repeat U/A
   - Renal u/s with dopplers
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   - FSG qid with HISS
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - CE with AM labs (refused 2^nd set)
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, ?due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after being found to have persistent renal failure. The patient has a history of noncompliance and has been prescribed various medications, including steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmia. However, he has a history of cardiac ischemia and has been prescribed beta-blockers in the past.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 93% on nasal cannula oxygen. His lung exam shows coarse bronchial sounds with diffuse wheezes.

The patient's neurological status is also stable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 and no signs of increased intracranial pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show a slight increase in his white blood cell count, which is likely due to his steroid therapy. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's history of COPD and decompensated heart failure increases his risk of developing ARDS.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and decompensated heart failure also increases his risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac ischemia and his current use of steroids and bronchodilators may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's current renal function is impaired, and his history of cardiac ischemia and decompensated heart failure may increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's history of COPD and decompensated heart failure may increase his risk of developing an infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue oxygen therapy to maintain a SpO2 of 93%.
2. Continue bronchodilators and steroids to manage the patient's COPD exacerbation.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
5. Consider consult with a pulmonologist or cardiologist to further manage the patient's condition.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION
 ASTHMA
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 (day 1 = [**4-14**], continue for 7 days, then
   taper over 7 days)
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin (day 1 = [**4-13**] for empiric course of 5 days)
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - [**Month/Year (2) 4198**] cardiac enzymes, repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative. Now resolved.
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR.
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC (pt refusing lab draws)
   - Currently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.
   - [**Name (NI) **] Cr (pt refusing lab draws)
   - UOP adequate overnight
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   FSG > 450 overnight [**4-14**].
   - FSG qid with HISS. Tighten scale by 1unit; if persists with
   hyperglycemia will consider adding low-dose lantus while on steroids
   for better control/[**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - Repeat CE (refusing lab draws)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, possibly due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after signing out against medical advice (AMA) from an outpatient setting.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 123/63 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, but with some word-finding difficulties.

The patient's laboratory results show a leukocytosis with a predominant neutrophil count, likely due to prednisone therapy. His creatinine level is elevated, with a FeNa of 0.4%, suggesting a prerenal etiology. The patient's urine output is adequate, and his renal ultrasound is negative for obstruction.

The patient has a history of glucose intolerance and is currently receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation. His blood glucose level is elevated, with a fasting serum glucose (FSG) of 450 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history also includes multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs), and he is currently on aspirin. He has a history of chronic pain and is taking oxycodone, but there is concern about medication overuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and hypoxia put him at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and decompensated heart failure increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac ischemia, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's prerenal azotemia and elevated creatinine level put him at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of glucose intolerance and current steroid therapy increase his risk for hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
5. Anxiety and withdrawal: The patient's history of anxiety and possible medication overuse put him at risk for anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and possible bacterial colonization of his respiratory tract increase his risk for infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status closely. The patient's medication regimen should be adjusted as necessary to manage his COPD exacerbation, hyperglycemia, and anxiety. Additionally, the patient's family and caregivers should be educated on his condition and treatment plan to ensure optimal care and support."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION
 ASTHMA
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 (day 1 = [**4-14**], continue for 7 days, then
   taper over 7 days)
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin (day 1 = [**4-13**] for empiric course of 5 days)
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - [**Month/Year (2) 4198**] cardiac enzymes (pt refusing), repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Resolved. Likely multifactorial with components
   from dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and
   tachypneic but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with
   SIRS/sepsis as also explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE.
   Substance withdrawal a possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for
   oxycodone overuse at OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10
   left on admission on [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative.
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR.
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC (pt refusing lab draws)
   - Currently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.
   - [**Name (NI) **] Cr (pt refusing lab draws)
   - UOP adequate overnight [**4-14**]
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   FSG > 450 overnight [**4-14**].
   - FSG qid with HISS. Tighten scale by 1unit; if persists with
   hyperglycemia will consider adding low-dose lantus while on steroids
   for better control/[**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - Repeat CE (refusing lab draws)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, possibly due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges
   - SW consult appreciated
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Peripherals.
   # Communication: Patient.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient). HCP 1 is wife [**Name (NI) 384**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Levaquin for empiric course of 5 days
* Incentive spirometry
* Clonazepam for anxiety

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed, including:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 93%, which is slightly low. The patient's respiratory rate is 19 insp/min, which is slightly elevated. The patient's chest x-ray shows atelectasis, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease. He is at risk for cardiac ischemia and arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient has persistent renal failure and is at risk for further deterioration. He is receiving IV fluids and has a urinary catheter in place.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has a fasting glucose level of 450 mg/dL, which is elevated. He is receiving insulin therapy to control his blood sugar levels.
* Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and is receiving clonazepam to manage his symptoms.

Based on the information provided, the patient's potential medical complications are:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications
* Renal failure
* Hyperglycemia
* Anxiety

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, dCHF, and CAD, who was admitted to the ICU with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has a number of comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, glucose intolerance, and a history of noncompliance with medical treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/63 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 93% on a nasal cannula. His lung exam reveals coarse and rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse wheezes.

The patient has a number of medications, including inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, and is being treated for a COPD exacerbation. He also has a number of laboratory abnormalities, including leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple admissions to the hospital for COPD exacerbations, and he has a history of noncompliance with medical treatment. He is currently refusing to take his medications, including his inhalers and oral corticosteroids.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. COPD exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia are consistent with a COPD exacerbation, and he is being treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and anemia may be indicative of an underlying infection, such as pneumonia.
3. Cardiovascular disease: The patient's history of CAD and dCHF puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage or failure.
5. Diabetes: The patient's history of glucose intolerance and elevated blood sugar levels puts him at risk for developing diabetes.
6. Substance withdrawal: The patient's history of oxycodone overuse and refusal to take his medications may indicate a risk of substance withdrawal.
7. Anxiety: The patient's history of anxiety and refusal to take his medications may indicate a risk of anxiety-related complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION
 ASTHMA
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 (day 1 = [**4-14**], continue for 7 days, then
   taper over 7 days)
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin (day 1 = [**4-13**] for empiric course of 5 days)
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - [**Month/Year (2) 4198**] cardiac enzymes (pt refusing), repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Resolved. Likely multifactorial with components
   from dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and
   tachypneic but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with
   SIRS/sepsis as also explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE.
   Substance withdrawal a possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for
   oxycodone overuse at OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10
   left on admission on [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative.
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR.
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC (pt refusing lab draws)
   - Currently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.
   - [**Name (NI) **] Cr (pt refusing lab draws)
   - UOP adequate overnight [**4-14**]
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up as an outpatient through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   FSG > 450 overnight [**4-14**].
   - FSG qid with HISS. Tighten scale by 1unit; if persists with
   hyperglycemia will consider adding low-dose lantus while on steroids
   for better control/[**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - Repeat CE (refusing lab draws)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, possibly due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges
   - SW consult appreciated
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Peripherals.
   # Communication: Patient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, and noncompliance. He was admitted to the ICU with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia.

The patient has undergone various tests and examinations, including an ultrasound, which showed an enlarged spleen and no evidence of renal artery stenosis. He has also had lab tests, including blood cultures, which were negative.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37°C (98.6°F), Tcurrent 36.7°C (98°F), HR 71 bpm, BP 123/63 mmHg, RR 19 breaths/min, SpO2 93%.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery, SpO2 93%.
* Physical examination: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, speaking in full sentences. HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM. Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated. Lungs: Coarse and rhonchorous BS b/l with diffuse wheezes. CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops. Abdomen: Refused examination. Ext: Refused examination. Neuro: AAO x 3, intention tremor b/l.

The patient has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He has also been prescribed medications for his conditions, including inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* COPD exacerbation: This can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and death.
* CKD: This can lead to end-stage renal disease, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
* CAD: This can lead to myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death.
* Anxiety: This can lead to increased heart rate and blood pressure, and may worsen COPD symptoms.
* Substance withdrawal: This can lead to withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, tremors, and seizures.
* Leukocytosis: This can lead to infection, inflammation, and organ damage.
* Dehydration: This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, organ damage, and death.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%.
* Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to manage COPD symptoms.
* Antibiotics to treat potential infections.
* Fluid management to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
* Pain management to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to detect potential complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, who was admitted to the ICU with a COPD exacerbation and hypoxemia. He is currently receiving oxygen therapy and nebulizers, as well as antibiotics (levofloxacin) for the exacerbation. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and is at risk for further complications.

Physical Examination:

The patient's physical examination is notable for a normal head, ears, nose, and throat, with symmetric chest expansion and loud rhonchi on auscultation. He has no acute distress and is alert and attentive.

Lab Results:

The patient's lab results are pending, but he has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and has a pending blood test to check his creatinine level.

Medical Complications:

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and hypoxemia put him at risk for respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and respiratory distress increase his risk for developing pneumonia.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases his risk for developing VAP.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's use of heparin for prophylaxis increases his risk for developing DVT.

Plan:

The patient's plan includes continuing steroids and nebulizers for his COPD exacerbation, as well as antibiotics (levofloxacin) for the exacerbation. He will also be rechecked for creatinine levels to monitor his acute renal failure. The remainder of his care will be managed by the ICU team."
