   Assessment and Plan
   IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman admitted to hospital s/p fall and transfered
   to the CCU with bradycardia
   .
   PLAN
   # Bradycardia: Transferred from the floor with hypotensive
   bradycardia.  She has had similar episodes here, worse during periods
   around sleep and responsive to atropine.  Has had myoclonic jerks
   suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion.  Family was initally hesititant
   to place a placemaker, but now wishes to have one placed.    Most
   likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block as no unconducted p
   waves observed during bradycardia.
   - EP consult early for placement.  Will need DNR/DNI status temporarily
   reversed & consent from HCP (brother).
   - Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed.
   - Dopamine or isoproteronol if needed for chronotrophic support.
   - hold metoprolol indefinitely.
   .
   # Low Urine output:  Appears dry.  Contraction alkalosis responds to
   IVF.  Orthostasis may have contributed to falls.
   - NS bolus, IVF.
   .
   # Elevated TSH: T3/T4 normal.  Likely sick euthyroid.
   .
   # Fall: likely that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.  Echo shoed
   mild AS, but not likely to be causitive.  No focal neuro deficits.
   - PT consult
   - consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia
   characterized and plan in place
   .
   # Hypertension; hold metoprolol
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia; continue statin
   .
   # CODE: DNR/DNI but ok for atropine and transcutaneous pacing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital after a fall and transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia. She has a history of similar episodes, which responded to atropine. The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm, but she has had episodes of severe bradycardia with loss of consciousness and brief respiratory arrest. She has also experienced myoclonic jerks, suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a laceration on her head, a 2/6 systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her neurological examination reveals that she is not oriented and has noted myoclonus.

Laboratory results show an elevated TSH level, but normal T3 and T4 levels, suggesting sick euthyroidism. Her coagulation profile is normal, and her blood gases are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes:

* EP consult for pacemaker placement
* Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed
* Dopamine or isoproterenol if needed for chronotrophic support
* Hold metoprolol indefinitely
* NS bolus and IVF for low urine output
* PT consult for fall evaluation
* Consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia is characterized and plan is in place

Potential medical complications:

* Bradycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.
* Myoclonic jerks can be a sign of cerebral hypoperfusion, which can lead to neurological deficits or even death.
* Low urine output can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and acute kidney injury.
* Elevated TSH level can be a sign of underlying thyroid disease, which can lead to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism if left untreated.
* Hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
* Depression and hyperlipidemia can have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 90-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital after a fall and was transferred to the CCU due to bradycardia. She has had multiple episodes of bradycardia, including several episodes of sinus pauses and loss of consciousness, which responded to atropine administration. The patient's family has decided to go ahead with pacemaker placement, and the EP is aware of the situation. The patient has also been experiencing myoclonic jerks while falling asleep. The differential diagnosis for her bradycardia includes sinus arrest or pauses vs. sino-atrial exit block, with sinus arrest and pauses being more likely. The patient's intrinsic escape rhythm may have been suppressed during sleep, which could have contributed to her symptoms.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Arrest:** Given the patient's history of bradycardia and sinus pauses, there is a risk of cardiac arrest if her heart rate does not increase or if she experiences another episode of sinus pause.
2. **Stroke:** The patient's bradycardia and sinus pauses could potentially lead to a stroke if the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to the brain.
3. **Myocardial Infarction (MI):** Although the patient's troponin levels are not elevated, there is still a possibility of an MI, especially given the patient's age and history of hypertension.
4. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's bradycardia and sinus pauses could lead to respiratory failure if her heart is unable to pump blood effectively to the lungs.
5. **Infection:** The patient's history of fall and bradycardia increases her risk of developing an infection, particularly in the respiratory or urinary tracts.
6. **Depression:** The patient's history of depression and recent fall could lead to further depression and decreased quality of life.
7. **Hypertension:** The patient's hypertension could exacerbate her bradycardia and increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's heart rate and rhythm in the CCU.
2. Administer atropine as needed to treat bradycardia.
3. Consider transferring the patient to the medicine service for further workup and management of her bradycardia.
4. Continue to evaluate the patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium and magnesium, to ensure they are within normal ranges.
5. Consider ordering an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac structure and function.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed.
7. Consider ordering a head CT scan to evaluate for potential intracranial bleeding or injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital after a fall and was transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia. The patient's condition has been stable, with a heart rate of 74-94 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 158/66-176/97 mmHg. The patient has been receiving various medications, including dopamine for heart rate control, and has had a pacemaker placed.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.4-10.6 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.8-10.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 181-198 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a laceration on the head, a systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border radiating to the carotids, and 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.

The patient's condition is being managed with a combination of medications and fluids, and the plan is to transfer her to the floor today. The patient's bradycardia has resolved, and the pacemaker has been interrogated today. The patient's low urine output has also resolved, and she is receiving IV fluids as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly given the patient's history of bradycardia and the presence of a pacemaker
* Infection, particularly given the patient's age and the presence of a laceration on the head
* Dehydration, particularly given the patient's history of low urine output
* Hypertension, particularly given the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of a systolic murmur
* Depression, particularly given the patient's history of depression and the potential for medication side effects
* Hyperlipidemia, particularly given the patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the potential for medication side effects."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital after a fall and was transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia. She was placed on a permanent pacemaker (PPM) yesterday and her bradycardia has resolved. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm and blood pressure of 158/66 mmHg. She has a mild systolic murmur and distant heart sounds. Her respiratory support is limited to nasal cannula oxygen and her oxygen saturation is 98%. Her physical examination is otherwise unremarkable.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression, and is taking medications for these conditions. She has also been prescribed metoprolol to control her blood pressure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia was likely caused by her fall and transfer to the ICU. However, it is possible that her bradycardia could recur, especially if she experiences another episode of sinus pause or bradycardia.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk for further complications if it is not controlled. Her hypertension may also be contributing to her bradycardia.
3. Low urine output: The patient's urine output has been low, and she may be at risk for further complications if her output does not improve.
4. Elevated TSH: The patient's TSH is elevated, and her thyroid function tests are normal. This may be a sign of sick euthyroid syndrome, which can occur in critically ill patients.
5. Fall: The patient's fall may have caused her bradycardia and sinus pause, and she may be at risk for further falls if her environment is not made safer.
6. Depression: The patient's depression may be contributing to her bradycardia and other medical complications. It is important to continue her antidepressant medication and to monitor her mental status closely.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may be contributing to her cardiovascular risk factors, and it is important to continue her statin medication and monitor her lipid levels closely.

Overall, the patient is at risk for further complications if her bradycardia, hypertension, low urine output, elevated TSH, and depression are not controlled. It is important to continue her medications and to monitor her vital signs and laboratory results closely."

   Assessment and Plan
   IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman admitted to hospital s/p fall and transfered
   to the CCU with bradycardia
   .
   PLAN
   # Bradycardia: Transferred from the floor with hypotensive
   bradycardia.  She has had similar episodes here, worse during periods
   around sleep and responsive to atropine.  Has had myoclonic jerks
   suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion.  Family was initally hesititant
   to place a placemaker, but now wishes to have one placed.    Most
   likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block as no unconducted p
   waves observed during bradycardia.
   - EP consult early for placement.  Will need DNR/DNI status temporarily
   reversed & consent from HCP (brother).
   - Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed.
   - Dopamine or isoproteronol if needed for chronotrophic support.
   - hold metoprolol indefinitely.
   .
   # Low Urine output:  Appears dry.  Contraction alkalosis responds to
   IVF.  Orthostasis may have contributed to falls.
   - NS bolus, IVF.
   .
   # Elevated TSH: T3/T4 normal.  Likely sick euthyroid.
   .
   # Fall: likely that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.  Echo shoed
   mild AS, but not likely to be causitive.  No focal neuro deficits.
   - PT consult
   - consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia
   characterized and plan in place
   .
   # Hypertension; hold metoprolol
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia; continue statin
   .
   # CODE: DNR/DNI but ok for atropine and transcutaneous pacing.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with bradycardia following a fall. She has been placed on a pacemaker and is currently receiving atropine and dopamine to maintain a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. She has a history of hypothyroidism, and her TSH levels are elevated, but her T3 and T4 levels are normal. She has also been experiencing low urine output, which has been treated with IV fluids. She has a history of hypertension, depression, and hyperlipidemia, and is currently taking medications for these conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is a significant concern, and she may require further management to maintain a stable heart rate. The use of atropine and dopamine may be necessary to achieve this.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated TSH levels may indicate hypothyroidism, which could be contributing to her symptoms. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Low urine output: The patient's low urine output is a concern, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the underlying cause and to manage this condition.
4. Fall risk: The patient's fall risk is high due to her age and medical conditions, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to reduce this risk.
5. Depression: The patient's depression may be contributing to her symptoms, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may be contributing to her symptoms, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.

Based on the patient's medical history and current symptoms, it is recommended that she be transferred to a medicine service for further evaluation and management."
