   Assessment and Plan
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 32 yo man with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Acute pancreatitis:  Etiology most likely chronic alcohol abuse.  No
   history of prior episodes per the patient, but after talking with
   family it seems he may have had previous episodes. At presentation,
   glucose >200, WBC >16k predictive of severe disease (does not meet
   other early [**Last Name (un) 1718**] criteria including as age <55, AST <250, LDH not
   measured but currently elevated to 530 ).  Regarding 48-hour criteria,
   Hct did fall by >10%, calcium is <8, presumably fluid sequestration >6L
   (based on the fact that he is persistently tachycardic despite 15 L
   in.  Does not meet criteria of BUN increase by 5, PaO2 <60 (although
   ABG on 4L), base deficit >4.  Overall [**5-22**] [**Last Name (un) 1718**] criteria positive
   predict very severe disease.  APACHE score 5 currently.
   - aggressive fluid rehydration:  IV NS at 250 cc/h for now, plan to
   titrate to maintain UOP >100 cc/h
   - pain management with IV dilaudid PRN
   - NPO except ice chips
   - review CT imaging with radiology for evidence of severe pancreatitis
   - CXR (effusions predict severe disease)
   - discuss with surgery, as he has multiple predictors of severe,
   necrotizing disease
   - consider re-imaging with contrast (will discuss with surgery)
   - replete calcium
   - check CRP (elevated predicts severe disease)
   - will check triglycerides, although etiology almost certainly EtOH
   .
   #) Delirium:  Possible contribution from EtOH withdrawal, acute
   illness, possible underlying psychiatric disorder?  If he continues to
   have this issue, would need to consider if he might actually be
   intoxicated with benzos rather than withdrawing.
   - 4-point restraints for now
   - treat EtOH withdrawal as below
   - continue Haldol PRN extreme agitation
   - consider psych consult
   .
   #) Fever: Febrile to 101 on admission.  Most likely secondary to
   pancreatitis.  Given the severity of his presentation and fevers,
   possible necrotizing pancreatitis, in which case prophylactic
   antibiotics may be indicated. Also on the differential would be
   pneumonia given effusions, but no cough, effusions likely secondary to
   3rd spacing and capillary leak from pancreatitis.
   - blood and urine cultures
   - consider imipenem (discuss with surgery)
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  most likely sedondary to fluid sequestration from
   severe pancreatatits.
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   .
   #) Hypertension: seems to have been a chronic issue for him although
   never treated as an outpatient, now worse in the setting of pain and
   EtOH withdrawal.
   - start labetalol 10 mg q6h; uptitrate PRN
   .
   #) Anion gap:  Anion gap on presentation to OSH 17, currently closed.
   Possibly was secondary to ketosis.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse:  CIWA 16 on arrival.  Last drink 6 days ago. Symptoms
   complicated by pain and anxiety.
   - change to Valium 5-10 mg q2h PRN
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs:  AST mildly elevated at 51.  Likely secondary to
   pancreatitis itself.  Possibly has a component of underlying cirrhosis
   [**3-20**] EtOH given fatty infiltration on recent US. Also has slightly
   abnormal coags, consistent with this.  Already received 5 mg vitamin K
   at OSH.
   - continue to monitor
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.
   - insulin SS
   .
   #) GU (difficult foley insertion, hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria)
   <br>
   #) F/E/N:  NPO, IVNS at 250 cc/h
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:   PPI, no bowel regimen given NPO

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with acute pancreatitis. He has been experiencing fever, agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.9Â°F, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 178/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 5L NC. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he appears anxious, has psoriatic lesions on his knuckles and right knee, and shows signs of mild distress. His lungs are clear bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases. The abdomen is distended with no bowel sounds heard, tympanic to percussion, tender to palpation in the epigastrium, and no fluid wave or shifting dullness. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood glucose level, elevated levels of amylase and lipase, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, including low calcium and magnesium levels. 

The patient's assessment and plan include acute pancreatitis, alcohol withdrawal, tachycardia, fever, and possible necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient is currently receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics. He is also being monitored for potential complications"

   Assessment and Plan
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 32 yo man with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Acute pancreatitis:  Secondary to alcohol abuse.  Meets multiple
   criteria for sever pancreatitis including [**Last Name (un) **]
s criteria ~5,
   elevated CRP, pleural effusions.  Discussed with surgery yesterday, who
   recommended CT with contrast for better evaluation of any fluid
   collection, air, necrosis.  However, this could not be obtain overnight
   secondary to agitation.   Currently he is agreeable to scan.   Also
   started irtapenem yesterday given likelihood of necrotizing disease,
   although the surgery team now feels that this is a bad idea.
   - continue aggressive fluid rehydration:  IV NS at 250 cc/h, titrate to
   maintain UOP >100 cc/h
   - pain management with IV dilaudid PRN
   - NPO except ice chips and sips
   - replete calcium
   - CT with contrast today
   - stop irtapenem for now pending CT today
   .
   #) Delirium:  Main differential is EtOH withdrawal vs benzodiazepine
   intoxication.   Other contributing factors include acute illness,
   possible underlying psychiatric disorder?   Currently he is calm and
   much more cooperative, completely oriented.
   - d/c 4-point restraints
   - calm reassurance
   - treat EtOH withdrawal as below
   - continue Haldol PRN extreme agitation
   - EKG for QTc given multiple doses of Haldol overnight
   - consider psych consult if unable to control
   .
   #) EtOH abuse:  Last drink 6 days ago; however, prolonged
   benzodiazepines may be lengthening withdrawal interval.  Given vast
   improvement after large doses of Valium, withdrawal (from either benzos
   and/or EtOH) is likely at play, although symptoms complicated by pain
   and anxiety.
   - Valium 10 mg q1h PRN CIWA >10
   .
   #) Fever: Febrile to 102.  Most likely secondary to pancreatitis.  Also
   on the differential would be pneumonia given effusions, but no cough,
   effusions likely secondary to 3rd spacing and capillary leak from
   pancreatitis.  Started irtapenem for empiric treatment of potentially
   necrotizing pancreatitis yesterday, but will stop now pending CT.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  most likely secondary to fluid sequestration
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   .
   #) Hypertension: seems to have been a chronic issue for him although
   never treated as an outpatient, now persistenting despite adequate
   control of pain and EtOH withdrawal.  Started labetalol yesterday.
   - uptitrate to labetalol 20 mg IV q6h; would consider hydralazine if he
   needs better control
   .
   #) Anion gap:  Anion gap on presentation to OSH 17, currently closed.
   Possibly was secondary to ketosis.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs and INR:  AST > ALT elevated, consistent with
   pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying EtOH cirrhosis given US findings at
   OSH and elevated INR.  s/p vit K 5 mg.
   - continue to monitor
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.  FS yesterday all ~100
   - d/c QID FS so has not to irritate patient
   .
   #) GU (difficult foley insertion, hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria):
   Foley out of place per CT at OSH.  s/p replacement  by excellent
   nursing staff overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with acute pancreatitis. The patient has multiple complications including delirium, suspected EtOH withdrawal, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, anion gap closure, elevated liver function tests and INR, hyperglycemia, and urinary tract issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe and may lead to local and systemic complications such as infection, abscess formation, pseudocysts, and organ failure.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can progress to severe agitation, seizures, and potentially life-threatening situations if not managed appropriately.

3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient is likely experiencing EtOH withdrawal, which can cause severe symptoms including seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens.

4. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection, particularly in the setting of pancreatitis where infections can occur due to pancreatic necrosis.

5. Hypotension and tachycardia: The patient's low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate possible hypovolemia and inadequate tissue perfusion. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly addressed.

6. Hypertension: The patient's chronic hypertension requires management to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack,"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 32 yo man with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Acute pancreatitis:  Secondary to alcohol abuse.  WBC continues to
   be elevated, still febrile.  He also continues to third  space
   significant amount of fluid, as evidenced by his stable Hct despite
   5.4L net in yesterday.  His abdomen is increasingly distended but this
   is more likely from partial ileus related to narcotics.   His pain and
   narcotic requirement is decreasing, and his pancreatic enzymes have
   fallen (although this does not necessarily correlate with improvement
   in pancreatitis.)
   - advance diet
   - f/u repeat KUB read from this morning
   - continue aggressive fluid rehydration
   - consider CT with contrast if he worsens clinically
   - f/u surgery recs
   ..
   #) Hypoxia:  he was hypoxic on admission with O2 Sat 86% on RA.  He has
   been on 4L since, but it is unclear if he actually has such an oxygen
   requirement (nasal cannula half off this morning and O2 Sat 99%).
   #) Delirium:  Main differential is EtOH withdrawal vs benzodiazepine
   intoxication.   Other contributing factors include acute illness,
   possible underlying psychiatric disorder?   Currently he is calm and
   much more cooperative, completely oriented.
   - d/c 4-point restraints
   - calm reassurance
   - treat EtOH withdrawal as below
   - continue Haldol PRN extreme agitation
   - EKG for QTc given multiple doses of Haldol overnight
   - consider psych consult if unable to control
   .
   #) EtOH abuse:  Last drink 6 days ago; however, prolonged
   benzodiazepines may be lengthening withdrawal interval.  Given vast
   improvement after large doses of Valium, withdrawal (from either benzos
   and/or EtOH) is likely at play, although symptoms complicated by pain
   and anxiety.
   - Valium 10 mg q1h PRN CIWA >10
   .
   #) Fever: Febrile to 102.  Most likely secondary to pancreatitis.  Also
   on the differential would be pneumonia given effusions, but no cough,
   effusions likely secondary to 3rd spacing and capillary leak from
   pancreatitis.  Started irtapenem for empiric treatment of potentially
   necrotizing pancreatitis yesterday, but will stop now pending CT.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  most likely secondary to fluid sequestration
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   .
   #) Hypertension: seems to have been a chronic issue for him although
   never treated as an outpatient, now persistenting despite adequate
   control of pain and EtOH withdrawal.  Started labetalol yesterday.
   - uptitrate to labetalol 20 mg IV q6h; would consider hydralazine if he
   needs better control
   .
   #) Anion gap:  Anion gap on presentation to OSH 17, currently closed.
   Possibly was secondary to ketosis.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs and INR:  AST > ALT elevated, consistent with
   pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying EtOH cirrhosis given US findings at
   OSH and elevated INR.  s/p vit K 5 mg.
   - continue to monitor
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.  FS yesterday all ~100
   - d/c QID FS so has not to irritate patient
   .
   #) GU (difficult foley insertion, hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria):
   Foley out of place per CT at OSH.  s/p replacement  by excellent
   nursing staff overnight.
   <br>
   #) F/E/N:  NPO, IVNS at 250 cc/h
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:   PPI, no bowel regimen given NPO
   <br>
   #) Communication.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is not well controlled. The blood pressure readings indicate persistent hypertension despite adequate control of pain and EtOH withdrawal. Labetalol has been started, and the dosage may need to be uptitrated or hydralazine considered for better control.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient is suffering from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. The WBC count is still elevated, and the patient is febrile. There is also fluid sequestration, as evidenced by the stable Hct despite significant fluid intake. Abdominal distention may be due to partial ileus related to narcotics. Pain and narcotic requirements are decreasing, but pancreatic enzymes have not necessarily correlated with improvement in pancreatitis.

3. Delirium: The patient exhibits signs of delirium, possibly due to EtOH withdrawal or benzodiazepine intoxication. Other contributing factors include acute illness and possible underlying psychiatric disorder. The patient is calm and cooperative but should be closely monitored. Restraints have been discontinued, and EKG for QTc has been ordered given multiple doses of Haldol overnight. A psych consult may be considered if unable to control symptoms.

4. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is likely experiencing EtOH withdrawal, which is complicated by pain and anxiety. Valium 10 mg q"

   narcotic requirement is decreasing, and his pancreatic enzymes have
   fallen (although this does not necessarily correlate with improvement
   in pancreatitis.)
   - advance diet
   - change meds to PO
   - f/u repeat KUB read from this morning
   - continue aggressive fluid rehydration
   - consider CT with contrast if he worsens clinically
   - f/u surgery recs
   ..
   #) Hypoxia:  he was hypoxic on admission with O2 Sat 86% on RA.  He has
   been on 4L since, but it is unclear if he actually has such an oxygen
   requirement (nasal cannula half off this morning and O2 Sat 99%).
   Likely secondary to atelectasis
   - wean O2 as tolerated.
   - out of bed
   - incentive spirometry
   .
   #) Hypertension: Not treated as an outpatient, but seems to have had
   chronic HTN, now persisten tdespite initiating labetalol and
   hydralazine yesterday.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV x 1 now
   - change to PO hydralazine and labetalol
   - uptitrate labetalol PRN
   - uptitrate to labetalol 20 mg IV q6h; would consider hydralazine if he
   needs better control
   .
   #) EtOH abuse:  Now requiring much less benzodiazepine.  Last drink 6
   days ago; however, prolonged benzodiazepines likely lengthening
   withdrawal interval.
   - Valium 10 mg q1h PRN CIWA >10
   - continue thiamine and folate
   #) Delirium:  Much improved now. Likely was secondary to EtOH
   withdrawal, ICU stay.  Currently he is calm and much more cooperative,
   completely oriented..
   .
   #) Fever: Ongoing fevers.   Most likely secondary to pancreatitis.
   Also on the differential would be pneumonia given O2 requirement and
   CXR with ? retrocardiac opacity.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - no antibiotics for now
   - d/c Foley
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  most likely secondary to fluid sequestration
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs and INR:  AST > ALT elevated, consistent with
   pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying EtOH cirrhosis given US findings at
   OSH and elevated INR.  s/p vit K 5 mg.
   - continue to monitor
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.  He has had normal glucose here.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with acute pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU for further management. His vital signs include a fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and an increased INR. Imaging studies reveal evidence of pancreatitis and possible atelectasis. The patient's abdomen is distended, and he has been aggressively hydrated. He has been on narcotic pain medication but is now more alert and cooperative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. This could be due to pancreatitis or pneumonia, especially considering his need for supplemental oxygen and the retrocardiac opacity seen on the chest X-ray.

2. Delirium: The patient initially presented with delirium likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal. Although he has improved significantly, close monitoring is still required.

3. Hypotension: Despite being hypertensive, the patient may experience hypotension due to fluid sequestration from pancreatitis.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's initial blood glucose level was elevated at 211 mg/dL. Although it has returned to normal levels, monitoring for hyperglycemia is essential, especially in the context of acute pancreatitis.

5. Bleeding: The elevated INR indicates impaired blood clotting. This is concerning, especially if the"

   Assessment and Plan

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 32 yo man with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Acute pancreatitis:  Secondary to alcohol abuse.  WBC continues to
   be elevated, still febrile.   Dilated colon.  Overall concerning for
   infection.  Would consider doing CT.
   Meets multiple criteria for sever pancreatitis including [**Last Name (un) **]
   criteria ~5, elevated CRP, pleural effusions.  Discussed with surgery
   yesterday, who recommended CT with contrast for better evaluation of
   any fluid collection, air, necrosis.  However, this could not be obtain
   overnight secondary to agitation.   Currently he is agreeable to
   scan.   Also started irtapenem yesterday given likelihood of
   necrotizing disease, although the surgery team now feels that this is a
   bad idea.
   - continue aggressive fluid rehydration:  IV NS at 250 cc/h, titrate to
   maintain UOP >100 cc/h
   - pain management with IV dilaudid PRN
   - NPO except ice chips and sips
   - replete calcium
   - CT with contrast today
   - stop irtapenem for now pending CT today
   .
   #) Delirium:  Main differential is EtOH withdrawal vs benzodiazepine
   intoxication.   Other contributing factors include acute illness,
   possible underlying psychiatric disorder?   Currently he is calm and
   much more cooperative, completely oriented.
   - d/c 4-point restraints
   - calm reassurance
   - treat EtOH withdrawal as below
   - continue Haldol PRN extreme agitation
   - EKG for QTc given multiple doses of Haldol overnight
   - consider psych consult if unable to control
   .
   #) EtOH abuse:  Last drink 6 days ago; however, prolonged
   benzodiazepines may be lengthening withdrawal interval.  Given vast
   improvement after large doses of Valium, withdrawal (from either benzos
   and/or EtOH) is likely at play, although symptoms complicated by pain
   and anxiety.
   - Valium 10 mg q1h PRN CIWA >10
   .
   #) Fever: Febrile to 102.  Most likely secondary to pancreatitis.  Also
   on the differential would be pneumonia given effusions, but no cough,
   effusions likely secondary to 3rd spacing and capillary leak from
   pancreatitis.  Started irtapenem for empiric treatment of potentially
   necrotizing pancreatitis yesterday, but will stop now pending CT.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  most likely secondary to fluid sequestration
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   .
   #) Hypertension: seems to have been a chronic issue for him although
   never treated as an outpatient, now persistenting despite adequate
   control of pain and EtOH withdrawal.  Started labetalol yesterday.
   - uptitrate to labetalol 20 mg IV q6h; would consider hydralazine if he
   needs better control
   .
   #) Anion gap:  Anion gap on presentation to OSH 17, currently closed.
   Possibly was secondary to ketosis.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs and INR:  AST > ALT elevated, consistent with
   pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying EtOH cirrhosis given US findings at
   OSH and elevated INR.  s/p vit K 5 mg.
   - continue to monitor
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.  FS yesterday all ~100
   - d/c QID FS so has not to irritate patient
   .
   #) GU (difficult foley insertion, hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria):
   Foley out of place per CT at OSH.  s/p replacement  by excellent
   nursing staff overnight.
   <br>
   #) F/E/N:  NPO, IVNS at 250 cc/h

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with acute pancreatitis. The patient has been febrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive. He also shows signs of possible infection and severe pancreatitis with fluid sequestration.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate the possibility of an ongoing infection. This is concerning, especially given the patient's acute pancreatitis and potential necrotizing disease.

2. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and symptoms such as agitation and tachycardia suggest that he may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to complications such as seizures and delirium tremens if not properly managed.

3. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension despite adequate control of pain and alcohol withdrawal indicates uncontrolled high blood pressure. If left untreated, this can lead to organ damage and other cardiovascular complications.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, with dilated colon and elevated CRP levels. Complications of pancreatitis can include necrosis, abscess formation, and systemic inflammation.

5. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and agitation raise concerns for delirium, which can be caused by various factors including alcohol withdrawal, pain, and underlying psychiatric disorders.

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 32 yo man with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Acute pancreatitis:  Secondary to alcohol abuse.  WBC continues to
   be elevated, still febrile.  He also continues to third  space
   significant amount of fluid, as evidenced by his stable Hct despite
   5.4L net in yesterday.  His abdomen is increasingly distended but this
   is more likely from partial ileus related to narcotics.   His pain and
   narcotic requirement is decreasing, and his pancreatic enzymes have
   fallen (although this does not necessarily correlate with improvement
   in pancreatitis.)
   - advance diet
   - change meds to PO
   - f/u repeat KUB read from this morning
   - continue aggressive fluid rehydration
   - consider CT with contrast if he worsens clinically
   - f/u surgery recs
   ..
   #) Hypoxia:  he was hypoxic on admission with O2 Sat 86% on RA.  He has
   been on 4L since, but it is unclear if he actually has such an oxygen
   requirement (nasal cannula half off this morning and O2 Sat 99%).
   Likely secondary to atelectasis
   - wean O2 as tolerated.
   - out of bed
   - incentive spirometry
   .
   #) Hypertension: Not treated as an outpatient, but seems to have had
   chronic HTN, now persisten tdespite initiating labetalol and
   hydralazine yesterday.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV x 1 now
   - change to PO hydralazine and labetalol
   - uptitrate labetalol PRN
   - uptitrate to labetalol 20 mg IV q6h; would consider hydralazine if he
   needs better control
   .
   #) EtOH abuse:  Now requiring much less benzodiazepine.  Last drink 6
   days ago; however, prolonged benzodiazepines likely lengthening
   withdrawal interval.
   - Valium 10 mg q1h PRN CIWA >10
   - continue thiamine and folate
   #) Delirium:  Much improved now. Likely was secondary to EtOH
   withdrawal, ICU stay.  Currently he is calm and much more cooperative,
   completely oriented..
   .
   #) Fever: Ongoing fevers.   Most likely secondary to pancreatitis.
   Also on the differential would be pneumonia given O2 requirement and
   CXR with ? retrocardiac opacity.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - no antibiotics for now
   - d/c Foley
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  most likely secondary to fluid sequestration
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs and INR:  AST > ALT elevated, consistent with
   pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying EtOH cirrhosis given US findings at
   OSH and elevated INR.  s/p vit K 5 mg.
   - continue to monitor
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.  He has had normal glucose here.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with pancreatitis. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypertension: The patient has persistent hypertension despite initiating labetalol and hydralazine. Further management should include uptitration of labetalol and considering additional antihypertensive medication.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. The elevated white blood cell count, fever, and third spacing of fluids indicate ongoing inflammation. The abdominal distention is likely due to a partial ileus related to narcotics. Pain and narcotic requirement are decreasing, but pancreatic enzymes have not necessarily correlated with improvement in pancreatitis.

3. Hypoxia: The patient was initially hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 86% on room air. He has been on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen but may not require it as the oxygen saturation is now 99%. This could be due to atelectasis, and further management should include weaning off oxygen as tolerated, out-of-bed activities, and incentive spirometry.

4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient requires less benzodiazepine, suggesting improvement in alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, prolonged benzodiazepine use may lengthen the withdrawal interval. Thiamine and folate should be continued.

5. Delirium: The patient showed signs of delirium, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal and ICU"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 32 yo man with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Acute pancreatitis:  Secondary to alcohol abuse.  Exam and
   pancreatic enzymes are improving, and fever curve trended down.
   - advance diet
   - stop IV fluids
   - f/u surgery recs
   ..
   #) EtOH abuse:  Now requiring much less benzodiazepine.  Last drink 6
   days ago; however, prolonged benzodiazepines likely lengthening
   withdrawal interval.
   - Valium 10 mg PRN CIWA; ok to change to q4h assessments on the floor
   - continue thiamine and folate
   - psych to evaluate him today
   .
   #) Hypoxia:  He continues to require 2L, an improvement from 4L when he
   came in.  Likely secondary to effusion, atelectasis, and now possible
   component of volume overload.
   - wean O2 as tolerated.
   - out of bed
   - incentive spirometry
   .
   #) Hypertension: Not treated as an outpatient, but seems to have had
   chronic HTN, now persisten tdespite initiating labetalol and
   hydralazine yesterday.
   - continue PO hydralazine and labetalol
   - uptitrate labetalol PRN
   - discuss with outpatient PCP if he/she has preference for particular
   agents
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs and INR:  AST > ALT elevated, consistent with
   pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying EtOH cirrhosis given US findings at
   OSH and elevated INR.  s/p vit K 5 mg.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Delirium:  Much improved now. Likely was secondary to EtOH
   withdrawal, ICU stay.  Currently he is calm and much more cooperative,
   completely oriented..
   .
   #) Fever: Much improved.  No evidence of infection.  Likely was [**3-20**]
   pancreatitis.
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  improved.  Likely component of anxiety.  Pain well
   controlled.
   .
   #) Hyperglycemia:  At OSH he presented with glucose 211.  No history of
   DM.  Likely [**3-20**] pancreatitis.  He has had normal glucose here.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with acute pancreatitis. He has shown improvement in his condition, with decreasing pancreatic enzymes and a downward trend in his fever curve. The patient's alcohol withdrawal symptoms are being managed with benzodiazepines, and he has now required much less medication. His last drink was six days ago, but prolonged use of benzodiazepines may be lengthening his withdrawal interval.

The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen, but the requirement has improved from 4L to 2L. This may be due to effusion, atelectasis, and possible volume overload. He is being encouraged to breathe deeply and cough, and weaning off oxygen is planned.

His blood pressure is elevated and not well-controlled despite initiating labetalol and hydralazine. The current plan is to continue with oral hydralazine and labetalol, uptitrate labetalol as needed, and discuss with the outpatient primary care physician if they have a preference for particular agents.

The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and an increased international normalized ratio (INR), which may be related to underlying alcohol-induced cirrhosis and pancreatitis. Monitoring of LFTs and INR will continue.

Delirium, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal and ICU stay, has significantly improved. The patient is now calm, cooperative, and completely oriented."
