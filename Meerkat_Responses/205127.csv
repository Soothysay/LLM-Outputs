","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including metastatic prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and weakness and had red/dark stools for two to three weeks. The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from the low to mid-30s. Stool guaiac was positive, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. An endoscopy was performed, but no clear source of bleeding was identified. The patient is currently being treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, and his hematocrit levels are being trended.

The patient experienced an episode of shortness of breath and agitation last night, which was concerning for heart failure. He responded well to treatment with intravenous Lasix. The patient's input/output balance shows a positive fluid balance of 2,619 mL, with an output of 966 mL through the urinary catheter.

On physical examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress. His eyes and conjunctiva are pale, and he has diminished distal pulses bilaterally. His respiratory system is clear, with breath sounds present. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. He has trace edema in both lower extremities, and his skin shows stage II ulcers on the right lower leg and sacral area.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL and a hematoc"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including metastatic prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and weakness, along with red/dark stools for the past 2-3 weeks. His hemoglobin level has decreased from the low to mid-30s. A stool guaiac test was positive, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an endoscopy which did not reveal a clear source of bleeding. 

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure, delirium, and coronary artery disease. His medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/37 to 125/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination findings include pale conjunctiva, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and stage II ulcers on the sacral area and right lower leg. Neurologic examination was not assessed. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated blood glucose, and prolonged prothrombin time/international"
