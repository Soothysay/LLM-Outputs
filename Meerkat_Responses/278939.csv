   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia who has been admitted to the ICU for dehydration and a new drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). She has also been diagnosed with recent left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL pna) and treated with antibiotics (ctx), specifically vancomycin (Vanc), which was later stopped due to a negative MRSA swab. The patient has received a total of 7 days of antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, normal blood pressure, and a positive stool guaiac indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. She has an elevated lactate level of 7.4, suggestive of lactic acidosis. The patient has been given 6 liters of normal saline (NS) intravenously.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's laboratory results show abnormalities. Her complete blood count (CBC) demonstrates a drop in all cell lines, which is believed to be a dilutional effect from the large volume of intravenous fluids administered. Her lactate level has decreased to 3.9. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) has increased from 1.5 to 1.7, indicating impaired blood clotting function. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been added to her treatment regimen, including vancomycin and zosyn, due to concerns of Clostridium difficile infection (CDiff).

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia who is admitted to the ICU with dehydration and a new drop in hemoglobin concentration. She has a recent diagnosis of lower left lung pneumonia (LLL PNA) and has been treated with corticosteroids, vancomycin, and then stopped vancomycin when MRSA swab was negative. She received 7 days of antibiotics. The patient is tachycardic, normotensive, and has a lactate level of 7.4. She has received 6 liters of normal saline.

24-hour events include lab abnormalities with a drop in all cell lines due to dilution from large IV fluid volume. Lactate level has decreased to 3.9. INR has increased from 1.5 to 1.7. Antibiotic therapy was broadened from Flagyl to add vancomycin and zosyn due to suspected Clostridium difficile infection.

Medical history indicates no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/51 to 127/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Sepsis: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative MRSA
   screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Also had lactic acidosis
   on admission, now resolved after fluid resuscitation.   Blood pressure
   has remained stable throughout her illness.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.  Now C. Diff negative x2, labs all stable, DIC labs negative.
   Clinically looks well, and is back to baseline per family.
   - No need for broad antibiotic coverage at this point. Will discontinue
   and follow clinically
   - Follow all cultures, no cough so unable to get sputum. All NGTD.
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Follow for 3^rd C. Diff to rule out, continue empiric therapy with IV
   flagyl until rules out
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - IVF prn as low PO
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and abdominal pain while continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia. 

The patient has several medical complications and potential risks. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with hospital-acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. However, due to her known risk factors for multi-drug resistant organisms, broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. There is concern for ongoing infection, so cultures are being followed, and the possibility of C. difficile infection is being ruled out.

2. Dehydration: The patient has been receiving IV fluids as needed and will continue to be monitored for adequate hydration.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has fluctuated over the past few weeks. It is attributed to a decline in her ability to perform self-care, fever, delirium, and underlying pneumonia and dehydration. Frequent reorientation and monitoring will continue.

4. Acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 32 to 26.5 after starting antibiotics and aggressive volume resuscitation. Her baseline hemoglobin level is unclear, but she is stable at 23 now. The guaiac test was initially negative in the ED but positive here, indicating"

   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Lactic acidosis: Main concern for systemic hypoperfusion (shock) or
   regional hypoperfusion (ischemic bowel) as these would be most
   dangerous.  However her sbp was never below 115 and her heart rate has
   gradually decreased from a max of 103 with IVF.  Minimal temperature
   derangement and relatively normal WBC without bandemia on admission.
   Am labs, however, with decrease in all lines on CBC.  Also minimal
   abdominal pain, although difficult to adequately assess her symptoms
   given her underlying dementia.   Likely multifactorial with combination
   of dehydration and metformin induced as well as concern for sepsis
   given decreased WBC and platelets.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Blood, urine, stool (including c diff x3), sputum cultures if
   possible.  All blood cultures and urine culture were negative at
   outside facility.
   - No peritoneal signs
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Empiric c dif therapy for now with IV flagyl.  If patient tests
   positive, will likely change to PO Vanco based on ICU stay, age and
   comorbidities.
   # Septic shock: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative
   MRSA screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.
   - Continue to cover broadly with Vanc/Zosyn
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Low threshold to cover atypicals if patient decompensates
   - DIC labs negative
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has
   had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard to ability
   to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium during her initial
   admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement after treatment for
   underlying pna and dehydration.
   - Continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and abdominal pain while on a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures and urine culture were negative at the outside facility. She has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia and has been treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin/zoledronic acid. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is hemodynamically stable. However, she has a low platelet count and a decreased white blood cell count. Imaging shows a left lower lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis, consolidation, or a combination of both, along with a small left pleural effusion. Laboratory results indicate dehydration and potential sepsis. The patient's blood lactate levels are decreasing. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's decreased WBC count, fever, and altered mental status suggest possible sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential sources of infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and pressure ulcers.
2. Diabetes-related complications: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, which increases her risk for diabetic complications such as lactic acidosis, especially in the setting of poor oral intake and diarrhea.

   patient was started on abx for her pneumonia, she developed decreasing
   Hct, from 32->26.5. Also in the setting of agressive volume
   resuscitation.  On admission was 31, now stable at 23 after significant
   volume resuscitation (she rec'd 6 L NS in the ED).  Guaiac negative in
   the ED, positive here. Unclear what her baseline hct is.
   - Continue to trend
   - Guaiac all stools, heme positive loose stool though patient has large
   hemorrhoids
   - IVF for volume prn
   - Consider GI consult if patient develops significant bleed
   - Maintain 2 large bore IVs
   # Diabetes mellitus type 2: By report, has been poorly controlled.
   Patient was on metformin prior, now has a lactic acidosis, likely in
   the setting of continuing metformin with poor PO and diarrhea.  Also on
   lisinopril at home, low dose (? for renal protection vs. hypertension)
   - Hold oral agents metformin and glipizide
   - D/c metformin indefinitely
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   - Hold lisinopril pending improvement in blood pressures and treatment
   of infection

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She presents with altered mental status, lactic acidosis, abdominal pain, dehydration, and significant diarrhea. The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia, for which she received 7 days of ceftriaxone treatment. She was then started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam due to known risk factors for multi-drug resistant organisms. She also has stage II decubitus ulcers on her heel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and diarrhea, suggest the possibility of sepsis. Blood, urine, and stool cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This could be due to dehydration or medication-induced nephrotoxicity.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 may contribute to her current metabolic derangement, including lactic acidosis and elevated blood glucose levels.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and significant diarrhea raise concerns for C. difficile infection. Treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin may be"
