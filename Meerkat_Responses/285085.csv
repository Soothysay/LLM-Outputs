","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with aggressive blood product resuscitation, unclear OSH resuscitation, and approximately 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfused. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure which was aborted due to the patient's anatomy. An IR suggested a CT liver in 24 hours after contrast washout to further determine vasculature. The patient received 5 units of pRBCs, 2 units of PLT, and 4 units of FFP. Hct post 8U pRBC was given at 30, and Hct was 35. The patient also had a fever of 101.3 degrees Celsius and pancultured. 

The patient is currently on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), octreotide, and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies include ceftriaxone given at 08:00 PM on 10/13/2159. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was admitted to the ICU for aggressive blood product resuscitation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent an unsuccessful attempt at transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, and a contrast washout was performed for further evaluation of the patient's vasculature.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was admitted to the ICU for aggressive blood product resuscitation due to ongoing bleeding. The patient underwent endoscopic gastric variceal banding, which likely caused the UGIB. He is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance and respiratory support are being closely monitored. The plan includes maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, hematocrit (Hct) above 30, urine output (UO) above 30 cc/hr, platelet count above 70,000/mm3, and fibrinogen level above 100 mg/dL. The patient is also receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor, ceftriaxone, and octreotide infusions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal and gastric varices. He underwent an unsuccessful attempt at transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have stabilized, and there is no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding. He is maintained on a variety of medications including proton pump inhibitor (PPI), ceftriaxone, and octreotide infusion. The plan is to perform a repeat 3-phase CT scan tonight with interventional radiology (IR) to consider repeating TIPS in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of HepC cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to the liver's inability to detoxify toxins such as ammonia.
2. Hepatic hydrothorax: This refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can occur in patients with cirrhosis.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): SBP is a bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome: This is a form of acute kidney injury seen in patients with advanced liver disease.
5. Esophage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent unsuccessful attempts at transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and gastric variceal banding. He received 5 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. His blood pressure is maintained above 65 mmHg, hematocrit (Hct) above 30, and urine output above 30 cc/hr. The patient is also on an infusion of octreotide and pantoprazole. The trauma line in the right internal jugular vein will be replaced with a central line today. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for possible coagulopathy. The plan includes maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP), Hct, platelet count, fibrinogen level, and monitoring for any signs of rebleeding. Imaging studies such as a CT abdomen/pelvis may be performed to evaluate the vasculature. Blood bank wants to administer Rhogam for Rh-positive platelets in a possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient presented to the emergency department with UGIB likely due to gastric variceal banding. He was intubated for airway protection and started on invasive ventilation. The patient is currently sedated on propofol and receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and octreotide. He is being aggressively resuscitated with blood products to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, hematocrit (Hct) above 30, urine output (UO) above 30 cc/hr, platelet count above 50,000, and fibrinogen level above 100 mg/dL. The patient has undergone several procedures including gastric variceal banding, placement of a cordis/introducer, trauma line, and arterial line. His current vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 127/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests and coagulation profile. The patient is awaiting transfer to interventional radiology for either transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or gastric"

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

During his stay in the ICU, the patient developed a fever and positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. This suggests a possible bloodstream infection, and the patient has been started on intravenous vancomycin for treatment. Surveillance cultures will be followed, and cultures from the lines will be drawn to determine if any of them are infected. The lines will also be resited.

The patient's UGIB is likely due to gastric variceal banding, as seen on an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on the day of admission. Aggressive resuscitation with blood products will be maintained to ensure a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65, hematocrit (Hct) greater than 30, urine output (UO) greater than 30 cc/hr, platelet count (Plt) greater than 70, and fibrinogen level greater than 100.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been intubated for airway protection. The patient's blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. He was started on IV Vancomycin as his lines are likely the source of the infection. The patient has undergone several procedures, including ultrasound, CTA abdomen, and attempted transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) without success. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 130/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormal liver function tests, including elevated ALT and AST levels, as well as low albumin levels. The patient is receiving aggressive resuscitation with blood products to maintain adequate hemodynamic parameters and is being closely monitored for any signs of infection or bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci, indicating a bacterial infection. With the presence of multiple lines and tubes, there is a risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-related thrombosis.
2. Bleeding: The patient presented with upper"

The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications such as respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates respiratory failure. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's respiratory status closely.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of HepC cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring the patient's mental status and neurologic function is crucial.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, especially considering the patient's cirrhosis and potential complications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management of bleeding risk is essential.

5. Line Infection: The positive blood cultures suggest a line infection. It is important to promptly address this infection and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires airway protection, leading to intubation. The patient's blood cultures were positive, indicating a potential infection in the intravenous lines. He has been started on intravenous vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in the blood cultures. The patient underwent an unsuccessful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure yesterday and will have another attempt today. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 134/80 to 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg, with fluid intake and output balanced. His laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as low platelet count and albumin levels. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The positive blood cultures suggest a potential bloodstream infection. The patient is already receiving treatment with vancomycin for gram-positive cocci. It is crucial to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen if necessary.
2. Bleeding:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis who presented to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal and gastric varices. The patient underwent an unsuccessful attempt at transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement and has an [**Last Name (un) 466**] tube in place. The patient is currently sedated and intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure. The patient is receiving various medications including ceftriaxone, octreotide, and pantoprazole, and is being closely monitored for bleeding, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's history of gastric variceal bleeding and unsuccessful TIPS attempt puts him at risk for re-bleeding. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and prompt intervention if signs of re-bleeding occur is crucial.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's HepC cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status and neurologic function is important.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone) and has a central venous catheter in place, which increases the risk of infection. Regular assessment of vital signs and close monitoring of laboratory parameters, especially white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal and gastric varices. He underwent an unsuccessful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and is currently at risk for rebleeding. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and management for his critical condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient is at significant risk for rebleeding from the gastric varices. Close monitoring of Hct levels and prompt intervention if necessary will be important to prevent further bleeding.
2. TIPS Procedure Complications: The patient underwent an unsuccessful TIPS procedure. If a repeat attempt is made, there is a risk of complications such as hepatic vein thrombosis, hematoma formation, infection, or worsening hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci and has been started on intravenous vancomycin. Ongoing surveillance cultures will be necessary to monitor for any changes in bacterial growth.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and will continue to be intubated pending the repeat TIPS procedure. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP will be done as permitted.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has deranged liver function tests with elevated liver enzymes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted to the ICU for various complications related to his condition. The note mentions several interventions and assessments carried out during his stay.

The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, which was successful. He also had gastric varices embolized, and his arterial line was stopped. The patient's trauma line was replaced by interventional radiology (IR), and he had a left brachial arterial line pulled. He was started on maintenance normal saline (NS) and discontinued from vancomycin due to the growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in the line culture.

The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) and octreotide infusions. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned complications. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/76 mmHg to 153/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Other lab values such as platelet count, creatinine, total bilir"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement on POD1 and has been in the ICU since admission. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 37.7°C
- Heart rate (HR): 88 bpm
- Blood pressure (BP): 138/76 mmHg
- Respiratory rate (RR): 12 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 99%
- Sinus rhythm (SR)

The patient's lab results show stable hemoglobin levels, leukocyte count, and platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are also within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, hematocrit (Hct) above 30, urine output (UO) above 30 cc/hr, platelet count above 70,000/mm3, and fibrinogen level above 100 mg/dL. The patient is currently on IV pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, and octreotide, which will be stopped on [**2159-10-18**].

The patient is also being monitored for respiratory failure, with plans to wean sedation and attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) this morning. The goal is to extubate the patient today. The patient's transaminitis is improving, although total bilirubin is slightly up from yesterday.

Nutrition assessment will be done after extubation, as the patient may need a speech and swallow consult. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic antibiotics for VAP and stress ulcers. A US will be done in one week and then every three months to evaluate the TIPS placement.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with no immediate complications reported."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He underwent gastric variceal banding and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement on POD2. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and not requiring any blood products since October 14th. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/69 mmHg to 129/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's respiratory support consists of a face tent with a ventilator mode set to standby, with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 27.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, and electrolytes. However, there is an elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L, and slightly decreased levels of albumin at 2.1 g/dL and calcium at 7"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HepC cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The UGIB is likely due to gastric variceal banding, as seen on OSH EGD on the day of admission. The patient underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) on POD2. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with no products since October 14th. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and he is extubated without event. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient is being treated with IV pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, and octreotide. The plan is to stop ceftriaxone on October 20th, and the patient will have an ultrasound (US) in one week and then every three months to evaluate TIPS. The patient is also being closely monitored for respiratory failure, transaminitis, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB, which can potentially reoccur, especially if the underlying cause is not fully addressed.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone), which indicates a concern for infection. This could be due to the recent procedure (TIPS) or an underlying infection.
