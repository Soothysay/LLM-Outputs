   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 yo male with recent head trauma s/p MVA who
   presents with seizures and question of Benadryl/TCA ingestion, now
   intubated for airway protection.
   # Seizure: Differential includes toxic-metabolic versus traumatic. LP
   underwhelming for infectious process and antimicrobials and antiviral
   held for now.  CTH negative of acute intracranial process, although
   patient this morning had ?irregular papillary response and so was sent
   for repeat CTH.  No other source of infection identified thus far,
   although patient does have HD line in place.  Also question of TCA
   overdose, although unclear if patient was taking TCAs and tox screen
   negative for TCAs. Patient evaluated by toxicology and recommended
   bicarb gtt with serial monitoring of intervals.
   - Hold on antimicrobials for now.
   - Repeat ECG this AM for QRS interval monitoring.
   - EEG today
   - Follow-up CTH  results
   - Seizure precauations
   - If seizes again, load with dilantin
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Follow-up neuo and toxicology recs
   - Obtain OSH/pharmacy info to see if pt was on TCA.
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient intubated at OSH for airway protection
   given recurrent seizures.  Currently on propafol sedation.
   - Wean sedation, RSBI and SBT today if appropriate.
   - If SBT successful, consider extubation.
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Patient febrile to 102 with leukocytosis and left
   shift concerning for infectious process. Lactate not normalized.  As
   above, LP negative with no other source identified. Vanco, CNS dose
   ceftriaxone, acyclovir all held.
   - Hold antimicrobials pending culture data.
   - Blood cultures through HD line.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Likely a combination of relative uremia and
   lactic acidosis. Notably, blood sugar was also elevated, but ketones
   were negative in the UA.  AG now narrowed at 12 with normal albumin
   with lactate normalized.
   - Trend chemistries/AG
   - IVF
   - Treat ESRD as below
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Unclear of renal baseline and patient has not been on HD
   in over a year. Currently, without volume overload or electrolyte
   abnormalities.  Patient with good UOP.
   - Trend chemistries, creatinine, and UOP.
   - Consult renal
   # Hepatitis C: Unclear status of liver disease.  Transaminases normal
   with preserved synthetic function.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Elevated Troponin: EKG with non-specific changes and troponin
   elevated in the setting of renal failure.
   - Rule out ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG
   - Monitor on telemetry
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary. IVF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with recent head trauma who presented with seizures and a possible overdose of Benadryl or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). He is intubated for airway protection. The patient has irregular pupils, bloody secretions when coughing, and clonus in both extremities. His vital signs include a fever of 102.6°F (39.2°C), blood pressure of 138/93 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. He also has metabolic acidosis and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizures. If he seizes again, loading with dilantin may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and recurrent seizures. Weaning sedation, performing a respiratory system assessment with a respiratory system assessment/breathing effort score (RSBI), and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be considered if appropriate. If the SBT is successful, extubation may be considered.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and left shift, which are concerning for an infectious process"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with recent head trauma and suspected ingestion of Benadryl/TCA. He presents with seizures and is intubated for airway protection. The patient's current condition includes fever, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, elevated troponin levels, and elevated liver enzymes. He also has hepatitis C, uncertain renal baseline, and possible TCA overdose. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including sedation, antibiotics, antivirals, and cardiac monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicate a potential infection. The possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be considered due to the patient's prolonged intubation.

2. Seizure: The patient's recurrent seizures pose a risk for further neurological complications, such as status epilepticus or brain injury. Proper seizure management and prophylaxis are essential.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction. AKI can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload, increasing the risk of further complications.

4. Cardiac Complications: The elevated troponin levels may indicate myocardial injury, potentially related to the patient's suspected TCA overdose or underlying coronary artery disease. Continuous cardiac monitoring and further evaluation for acute coronary syndrome"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with recent head trauma, seizures, and possible Benadryl/TCA ingestion. He is intubated for airway protection. The patient has a fever and leukocytosis with a left shift, but these have improved. His AG and lactate levels were initially elevated but have normalized. The patient may have relative uremia and lactic acidosis. His renal function is unclear, and he has not been on dialysis in over a year. He is awaiting outpatient records. The patient also has hepatitis C with normal transaminase levels. His troponin levels are elevated, and he has non-specific changes on EKG. He is being monitored on telemetry to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient is receiving IV fluids, prophylactic heparin, and bowel regimen. He has multiple IV lines and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient presented with seizures, which could be due to head trauma or toxic-metabolic causes. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antiepileptic drug management are crucial to prevent further seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, possibly secondary to airway protection during seizures. Weaning sedation, assessing respiratory support, and considering extubation based on the patient's progress are essential.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of seizure and a history of chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is sedated and intubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are some concerning findings. The patient has a fever, elevated blood pressure, and abnormal laboratory results including elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin levels. The patient's neurological examination shows clonus bilaterally and equivocal Babinski sign. The patient is not following commands. Imaging studies show no acute changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient's respiratory status appears stable, the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an infection, which can lead to ARDS.
2. Cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction: Elevated troponin levels indicate potential cardiac damage, which may be due to ischemia or a recent myocardial infarction.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizure and the presence of clonus bilaterally raise concerns for recurrent seizure activity.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which needs to be further investigated and treated.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's history of chronic renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction, which may require adjustment of medications and close monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 yo male with recent head trauma s/p MVA who
   presents with seizures and question of Benadryl/TCA ingestion, now
   intubated for airway protection.
   # Seizure: Exact cause unclear. Differential includes toxic-metabolic
   or trauma p MVA. LP underwhelming for infectious process Head MRI
   preliminarily without structural abdnormalities. Prelim EEG without
   specific pattern.
   - empiric vanc/CTZ
   - Final MRI/EEG read pnd
   - loaded with dilantin, f/u levels.
   - f/u Neuro and NSurg
   # C2 fluid collection on MRI: concerning for abscess, although
   neurosurg suggested this may be hematoma.
   - monitor neuro exam q2 hrs
   - C spine collar
   - NSurg rec re repeat MRI +/- contrast
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient intubated at OSH for airway protection
   given recurrent seizures.  Currently on propafol sedation.
   - Wean sedation, midaz bolus for agitation, RSBI and SBT today,
   consider extubation.
   # Leukocytosis/fever: presented with fever to 102 and leukocytosis
   which initially improved but  overnight spiked to 101 and was
   pancultured. LP negative, Cx NGTD. C2 fluid collection concerning for
   abscess.
   - ABX as above; if continues to spike or if develops new leukocytosis
   or if positive cx would broaden spectrum
   - f/u cx, cdiff
   - if bacteremic would ECHO for endocarditis
   - Trend fever curve, WBC.
   # AGMA: Likely a combination of relative uremia and lactic acidosis.
   Notably, blood sugar was also elevated, but ketones were negative in
   the UA.  AG now narrowed at 12 with normal albumin with lactate
   normalized.
   # ESRD on HD: Unclear of renal baseline and patient has not been on HD
   in over a year. Currently, without volume overload or electrolyte
   abnormalities.  Patient with good UOP. Ample uop.
   - Trend chemistries, creatinine, and UOP.
   # Hepatitis C: Unclear status of liver disease.  Transaminases normal
   with preserved synthetic function.
   - Continue to trend LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with recent head trauma following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). He presents with seizures and there is a question of Benadryl/TCA ingestion. The patient is intubated for airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The exact cause of the seizure is unclear. Possible causes include toxic-metabolic or trauma-related due to the MVA. A lumbar puncture was performed, but it did not reveal an infectious process. A head MRI showed no structural abnormalities, and the preliminary EEG did not show any specific pattern. The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin and ceftazidime.

2. C2 fluid collection on MRI: This is concerning for an abscess, although neurosurgery suggests it may be a hematoma. Monitoring of the neuro exam every two hours is recommended, along with the use of a cervical spine collar. A repeat MRI with or without contrast is also advised.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated at the emergency room for airway protection due to recurrent seizures. He is currently sedated with propofol. The plan is to wean sedation, perform a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, and consider extubation if appropriate.

4. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient initially presented with fever and leukocyt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, respiratory failure, renal failure, and seizure activity. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of chronic renal failure and is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, and sedatives. The patient's temperature is elevated at 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate is 68 beats per minute, blood pressure is 95/62 mmHg, respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His neurological examination is limited due to sedation but shows signs of clonus and an equivocal Babinski reflex. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a positive fluid balance over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive fluid balance suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to chronic renal failure and recent seizure activity.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with recent head trauma following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). He presents with seizures and there is a question of Benadryl/TCA ingestion, for which he is now intubated for airway protection. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 95/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. He is sedated and intubated.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is sedated, intubated, and has normal cardiovascular examination. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding noted. The extremities are warm, well perfused, and have 2+ pulses. No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema is present. Neurological examination is limited due to sedation, but notable for clonus bilaterally and equivocal Babinski sign. The patient does not follow commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated platelet count. Creatinine levels are within normal range. Troponin T is negative. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include seizure management, C2 fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male patient who has recently experienced head trauma following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). He presents with seizures and there is a question of Benadryl/TCA ingestion. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/82 mmHg to 183/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 418 mL and a total output of 2,270 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,852 mL. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 517 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with white blood cell (WBC) counts ranging from 13.4 to 13.7 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) levels ranging from 30.4% to 34.7%, platelet (Plt) counts ranging from 118 to 148 thousand/mm3, blood glucose levels ranging from 105 to 141 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels within normal range.

The assessment and plan for the patient include several concerns. Firstly, there is a C2 epidural fluid collection seen on MRI, which neurosurgery believes is likely a hematoma. The patient is experiencing pain secondary to the mass effect. Secondly, there is a seizure with an unclear cause, possibly due to toxic-metabolic factors or trauma from the MVA. Lastly, there is leukocytosis and fever, initially improving but continuing to spike, which raises concern for an epidural abscess.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Development of an epidural abscess due to the presence of fever and leukocytosis.
2. Seizure recurrence or progression.
3. Complications related to the C2 epidural fluid collection, which could potentially lead to further neurological deficits or compression.
4. Potential deterioration of the patient's respiratory status due to ongoing inflammation or infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's neurological status, respiratory function, and laboratory parameters to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."
