   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments throughout the day. These include the placement of a right internal jugular (IJ) line, administration of D10 (dextrose 10% in water) drip requiring D50 (dextrose 50%) boluses, decrease in D10 drip to 50/hr, restart of sedation due to discomfort, postponement of femoral bypass surgery, and initiation of multi-lumen lines.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure ranging from 118/23-161/54 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm with sinus tachycardia, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,256 mL with 705 mL given through the PO (not specified), 1,944 mL given through IVF (intravenous fluids), and 113-171 mL given through NG (nasogastric) tube. Total output includes 1,745 mL of urine and 970 mL of blood products. The fluid balance is positive at 511 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 17.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 22.4%, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 427 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.4 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose at 134 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status (not delirium), gangrene, hypoglycemia, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU with various interventions for glycemic control, nutrition, line placements, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, further deterioration of mental status, progression of gangrene, and potential bleeding due to low platelet count and prolonged PTT."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o M with PMHx of PVD, dry gangrene, colonic mass, DM and ARF
   thought due to AIN who was transferred to the ICU for acute mental
   status changes and hypoglycemia.
   .
   # Mental Status changes: Pt with acute change in MS in setting of
   persistent hypoglycemia that did not improve with correction of BS or
   administration of Narcan.  Differential includes toxic metabolic
   insults including hypoglycemia, uremia, large CVA, narcosis, meningitis
   or encephalitis, status epilepticus, ICH not seen on head CT.  ABG did
   not reveal any acute hypercarbia or acidosis, Addisons disease much
   less likely given that pt received  Pt is now intubated for airway
   protection and has had return of some spontaneous lower extremity
   movements.  Given normal head CT and return of spontaneous lower
   extremity movements, suspect that hypoglycemic insult is most likely
   source of MS changes
   - f/u final head CT
   - apprec neuro consult
   - increase D10W to 100cc/hr
   - q1hr BS checks, 1 amp of dextrose prn BS<100
   - f/u urine/serum tox, blood Cx, Urine Cx, Fungal Cx
   - consider EEG if MS status fails to improve
   - serial neuro exams
   .
   # Resp failure/airway protection: Pt was intubated for airway
   protection given GCS score of 3.  Post intubation CXR revealed lower
   lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration.  Clinically, pt was sating
   well on AC with ABG of 7.46/33/126 and was transitioned to PS of [**6-3**].
   Will remain intubated for now given MS changes and neuro compromise.
   - monitor clinically, CIS
   - start linezolid/zosyn if worsening infiltrates, fever or increasing
   vent requirements
   -  hold propofol and monitor neuro status
   -
   # Dry Gangrene: Pt was initially transferred for severe PVD and dry
   gangrene, initially managed by Vascular and transferred to medicine on
   [**2-14**]. Given the open wounds, hypoglycemia and spike in WBCs, will
   repeat Blood/Fungal Cx today.  Pt has been afebrile off antibiotics
   with persistently elevated WBC cts, plan for vascular intervention
   later this week per notes.
   - apprec Vasc surgery recs
   - no Abx for now
   - blood Cx/fungal Cx
   - wound care consult
   .
   # ARF: per renal consult, most likely AIN secondary to Vanc and
   currently resolving with creatinine of 1.7.  However, hypoglycemia most
   likely due to decreased clearance of glyburide.
   - monitor creatinine daily, gentle IVF
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # DM: Holding all oral hypoglycemics, and insulin products for now
   - monitor BS checks q1hr and continue D10W at 50cc/hr
   - dextrose amps prn BS<100
   - restart insulin SS when BS persistently >200
   .
   # HTN: Pt was being treated with metoprolol prior to MS changes
   - will hold anti-hypertensives peri-intubation, monitor BPs and add
   back prn
   .
   # Colonic Mass: first  seen on sigmoidoscopy from [**2-22**].  GI notes refer
   to colonoscopy this week.
   - monitor hct daily
   - f/u GI recs, will likely need colonoscopy in future
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, will place OG today & Nutrition consult for TFs
   - replete electrolytes prn
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin 5000u sc TID

   # Mental Status changes: Pt with acute change in MS in setting of
   persistent hypoglycemia that did not improve with correction of BS or
   administration of Narcan.  Differential includes toxic metabolic
   insults including hypoglycemia, uremia, large CVA, narcosis, meningitis
   or encephalitis, status epilepticus, ICH not seen on head CT.  ABG did
   not reveal any acute hypercarbia or acidosis, Addisons disease much
   less likely given that pt received  Pt is now intubated for airway
   protection and has had return of some spontaneous lower extremity
   movements.  Given normal head CT and return of spontaneous lower
   extremity movements, suspect that hypoglycemic insult is most likely

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, dry gangrene, colon mass, diabetes mellitus, and acute renal failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute mental status changes and hypoglycemia. He is currently intubated for airway protection and has shown some improvement with spontaneous lower extremity movements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Mental Status Changes: The patient has experienced acute mental status changes, which may be due to hypoglycemia, uremia, large cerebrovascular accident (CVA), narcosis, meningitis, encephalitis, or status epilepticus. Further evaluation and management are required, including neuro consult, serial neuro exams, and EEG results.

2. Respiratory Failure/Airway Protection: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. A chest X-ray revealed lower lobe infiltrates, suggesting aspiration. The patient will remain intubated until mental status improves and neuro compromise resolves. Monitoring and linezolid/zosyn therapy are recommended.

3. Dry Gangrene: The patient has dry gangrene and open wounds, leading to elevated white blood cell counts. Blood and fungal cultures should be repeated, and vascular intervention is planned later this week. Wound care consult and appreciation of vascular surgery recommendations are needed.

4. Acute Renal Failure (AIN): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), dry gangrene, colonic mass, diabetes mellitus (DM), and acute renal failure (ARF). He was admitted to the ICU for acute mental status changes and hypoglycemia. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to a low Glasgow Coma Scale score. Post-intubation chest X-ray revealed lower lobe infiltrates, indicating possible aspiration. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and he has shown improvement with the administration of dextrose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonia, which is indicated by the presence of lower lobe infiltrates on the chest X-ray. This could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential sepsis.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's repeated episodes of hypoglycemia require close monitoring and prompt treatment. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to severe brain damage or even death.
3. Gangrene: The patient's dry gangrene needs proper management to prevent further tissue necrosis and potential infection. Inadequate treatment may result in the spread of gangrene and systemic infection.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AIN): The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury, likely secondary to vancomycin and currently resolving. It is essential to monitor the"

   73 y/o M with PMHx of PVD, dry gangrene, colonic mass, DM and ARF
   thought due to AIN who was transferred to the ICU for acute mental
   status changes and hypoglycemia.
   # Mental Status changes: Pt with acute change in MS in setting of
   persistent hypoglycemia that did not improve with correction of BS or
   administration of Narcan.  Pt is now intubated for airway protection
   and has had return of some spontaneous lower extremity movements.
   Given normal head CT and return of spontaneous lower extremity
   movements, suspect that hypoglycemic insult is most likely source of MS
   changes
   - Neuro consult
   - Decrease D10W to 25cc/hr, continue to wean
   - q1hr BS checks, 1 amp of dextrose prn BS<100
   - f/u on blood Cx, Urine Cx-UA evidence of UTI, Fungal Cx
   - f/u on EEG results

   - Hold TF, attempt to extubate this afternoon after MRI
   # Resp failure/airway protection: Pt was intubated for airway
   protection given GCS score of 3.  Post intubation CXR revealed lower
   lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration.  Clinically, pt was sating
   well on AC with ABG of 7.46/33/126 and was transitioned to PS of [**6-3**].
   Will remain intubated for now given MS changes and neuro compromise.
   - monitor clinically, CIS
   - start linezolid/zosyn with GPC in sputum and low grade fever curve
   -  hold propofol and monitor neuro status
   - attempt to extubate this afternoon
   # Dry Gangrene: Pt was initially transferred for severe PVD and dry
   gangrene, initially managed by Vascular and transferred to medicine on
   [**2-14**]. Given the open wounds, hypoglycemia and spike in WBCs, will
   repeat Blood/Fungal Cx today.  Pt has been afebrile off antibiotics
   with persistently elevated WBC cts, plan for vascular intervention
   later this week per notes.
   - apprec Vasc surgery recs
   - no Abx for now for wound specifically, but started on Linezolid and
   Zosyn for GPC on sputum
   - blood Cx/fungal Cx
   - wound care consult
   # ARF: per renal consult, most likely AIN secondary to Vanc and
   currently resolving with creatinine of 1.7.  However, hypoglycemia most
   likely due to decreased clearance of glyburide.
   - monitor creatinine daily, gentle IVF
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal rec

   status changes and hypoglycemia.
   # Mental Status changes: Pt with acute change in MS in setting of
   persistent hypoglycemia that did not improve with correction of BS or
   administration of Narcan.  Pt is now intubated for airway protection
   and has had return of some spontaneous lower extremity movements.
   Given normal head CT and return of spontaneous lower extremity
   movements, suspect that hypoglycemic insult is most likely source of MS
   changes
   - Neuro consult
   - Continue D10W to 25cc/hr
   - q1hr BS checks, 1 amp of dextrose prn BS<100
   - serial neuro exams
   - Hold TF, attempt to extubate this afternoon
   - F/U MRI
   # Resp failure/airway protection: Pt was intubated for airway
   protection given GCS score of 3.  Post intubation CXR revealed lower
   lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration.  Clinically, pt was sating
   well on AC with ABG of 7.46/33/126 and was transitioned to PS of [**6-3**].
   Will remain intubated for now given MS changes and neuro compromise.
   - monitor clinically, CIS
   - start linezolid/zosyn with GPC in sputum and low grade fever curve 7
   day course ending [**2132-3-5**]
   -  hold propofol and monitor neuro status
   - attempt to extubate this afternoon
   # Dry Gangrene: Pt was initially transferred for severe PVD and dry
   gangrene, initially managed by Vascular and transferred to medicine on
   [**2-14**]. Given the open wounds, hypoglycemia and spike in WBCs, will
   repeat Blood/Fungal Cx today.  Pt has been afebrile off antibiotics
   with persistently elevated WBC cts, plan for vascular intervention
   later this week per notes.
   - apprec Vasc surgery recs
   - no Abx for now for wound specifically
   - blood Cx/fungal Cx
   - wound care consult
   # ARF: per renal consult, most likely AIN secondary to Vanc and
   currently resolving with creatinine of 1.7.  However, hypoglycemia most
   likely due to decreased clearance of glyburide.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory Failure/Airway Protection: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to acute mental status changes and a GCS score of 3. Post intubation CXR revealed lower lobe infiltrates, which is concerning for aspiration. The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes and neuro compromise.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has persistent hypoglycemia, which did not improve with correction of blood sugar levels or administration of Narcan. This could be related to decreased clearance of glyburide, a medication for diabetes management. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels is necessary.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) most likely secondary to AIN (acute interstitial nephritis) caused by Vancomycin. The creatinine level is improving, but close monitoring and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 9.6 g/dL. Considering the ongoing blood loss and the need for surgery, it is important to address this issue. A blood transfusion may be necessary.

5. Colonic Mass: The patient has a colonic mass that requires further evaluation. A colonoscopy is planned to assess the extent of the mass. Given the size of the rectal mass, colectomy may"

   73 y/o M with PMHx of PVD, dry gangrene, colonic mass, DM and ARF
   thought due to AIN who was transferred to the ICU for acute mental
   status changes and hypoglycemia.
   # Mental Status changes: Pt with acute change in MS in setting of
   persistent hypoglycemia that did not improve with correction of BS or
   administration of Narcan.  Pt is now intubated for airway protection
   and has had return of some spontaneous lower extremity movements.
   Given normal head CT and return of spontaneous lower extremity
   movements, suspect that hypoglycemic insult is most likely source of MS
   changes
   - Neuro consult
   - Continue D10W to 25cc/hr
   - q1hr BS checks, 1 amp of dextrose prn BS<100
   - serial neuro exams
   - Hold TF, attempt to extubate this afternoon
   - F/U MRI
   # Resp failure/airway protection: Pt was intubated for airway
   protection given GCS score of 3.  Post intubation CXR revealed lower
   lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration.  Clinically, pt was sating
   well on AC with ABG of 7.46/33/126 and was transitioned to PS of [**6-3**].
   Will remain intubated for now given MS changes and neuro compromise.
   - monitor clinically, CIS
   - start linezolid/zosyn with GPC in sputum and low grade fever curve 7
   day course ending [**2132-3-5**]
   -  hold propofol and monitor neuro status
   - attempt to extubate this afternoon
   # Dry Gangrene: Pt was initially transferred for severe PVD and dry
   gangrene, initially managed by Vascular and transferred to medicine on
   [**2-14**]. Given the open wounds, hypoglycemia and spike in WBCs, will
   repeat Blood/Fungal Cx today.  Pt has been afebrile off antibiotics
   with persistently elevated WBC cts, plan for vascular intervention
   later this week per notes.
   - apprec Vasc surgery recs
   - no Abx for now for wound specifically
   - blood Cx/fungal Cx
   - wound care consult
   # ARF: per renal consult, most likely AIN secondary to Vanc and
   currently resolving with creatinine of 1.7.  However, hypoglycemia most
   likely due to decreased clearance of glyburide.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), dry gangrene, colon mass, diabetes mellitus (DM), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute mental status changes and hypoglycemia. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, gangrene, hypoglycemia, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and ABG values is necessary. The patient may require prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation until the respiratory status improves.
2. Gangrene: The patient has dry gangrene, which can lead to tissue necrosis and potential systemic infection. Regular wound care, blood and fungal cultures, and vascular consultation are required to prevent further complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia needs close monitoring with frequent blood sugar checks. Administration of dextrose infusion and careful management of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications are essential to maintain stable blood glucose levels.
4. Acute Renal Failure (AIN): The patient has ARF likely secondary to vancomycin and is currently resolving. Monitoring of creatinine levels and avoidance of nephrotoxins are crucial to prevent further renal damage."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease, dry gangrene, colonic mass, diabetes mellitus, and acute renal failure thought to be due to atrial natriuretic peptide. He was admitted to the ICU for acute mental status changes and hypoglycemia. The patient was intubated for airway protection and extubated without difficulty. He is now able to follow commands and is alert. The patient's mental status changes improved with correction of blood sugar levels. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, gangrene, hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure. He also has a colonic mass that is confirmed to be an adenoma. 

Plan:
- Monitor neurologic status closely with serial neuro exams.
- Continue tube feeds and restart insulin subcutaneous drip if blood glucose levels persistently remain above 200.
- Follow up with final read of MRI.
- Continue antibiotics for suspected osteomyelitis.
- Monitor creatinine daily and avoid nephrotoxins.
- Hold all oral hypoglycemics and insulin products for now.
- Restart insulin subcutaneous drip when blood glucose levels persistently exceed 200.
- Continue tube feeds.
- Add back anti-hypertensives as needed.
- Schedule colectomy following resolution of vascular issues.
- Maintain full code status.

   status changes and hypoglycemia.
   # Mental Status changes: Pt with acute change in MS in setting of
   persistent hypoglycemia that did improve slowly with correction of BS.
   The patient was extubated without difficulty.  Improved, able to follow
   commands
   - Neuro on board, serial neuro exams
   - Discontinued D10 drip, started Tube feeds, at goal
   - F/U final read of MRI
   # Resp failure/airway protection: Pt was intubated for airway
   protection given GCS score of 3.  Extubated without difficulty
   - monitor clinically, CIS
   - started linezolid/zosyn with GPC in sputum and low grade fever curve
   7 day course ending [**2132-3-5**], given vanc allergy
   # Dry Gangrene: Pt was initially transferred for severe PVD and dry
   gangrene, initially managed by Vascular and transferred to medicine on
   [**2-14**]. Given the open wounds, hypoglycemia and spike in WBCs, repeated
   Blood/Fungal Cx.  Pt has been afebrile, elevated low grade temp
   - Vascular [**Doctor First Name **] and wound care on board

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with severe peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus type II, admitted for severe hypoglycemia, confusion, and intubation. He has also been found to have a rectal mass biopsy with adenoma. The patient is currently extubated and stable, with his glucose levels stable off D10. He is being covered for potential aspiration with linezolid and zosyn. The patient has a lower extremity ulcer and chronic osteomyelitis with high white blood cell count, for which he is also on linezolid and zosyn. He has anemia due to blood loss from the adenoma and chronic disease. The colonic mass is suspected to be cancerous, and resection will be needed. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition repletion, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and he is scheduled for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is currently stable and extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure, especially if he aspirates or develops pneumonia.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of severe hypoglycemia puts him"
