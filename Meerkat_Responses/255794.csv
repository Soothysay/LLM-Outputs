   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. She presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). She has been started on heparin therapy and is receiving supplemental oxygen with a goal SpO2 >94%. Telemetry monitoring has also been continued. An echocardiogram has been ordered to assess the prognosis, particularly for heart failure and to reassess code status.

The patient's lung cancer is described as stage IV NSCLC, for which she has received brain irradiation with plans for cyberknife treatment. She completed a 15-day course of Navelbine treatment on [**2126-10-8**]. The patient is advised to have a regular diet, and RISS has been given due to hyperglycemia likely related to decadron. Electrolyte repletion scales are also being followed.

The patient has two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines in place. She has been prescribed heparin IV and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as part of her treatment. Her code status is set to ""FULL,"" and she is to be disposed in the ICU. The patient's son, [**Name (NI)**], and [**Name (NI)**], have been contacted for communication purposes."

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases presenting with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. The patient was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA), along with some findings consistent with right ventricular strain on electrocardiogram (EKG) and physical examination.

The patient has been started on intravenous (IV) heparin without a bolus, discussed with oncology regarding brain metastases and the risks of anticoagulation. Telemetry has been obtained to monitor the heart rhythm, and an echocardiogram is planned to evaluate for significant right ventricular strain or potential pulmonary embolism-related clots in the right atrium or right ventricle. A lower extremity ultrasound will also be performed to evaluate for high clot burden.

The patient's bandemia, which refers to the presence of bands on the peripheral blood smear, is likely due to decadron treatment for brain metastases. No fevers are present, and a repeat complete blood count (CBC) with differential is planned in the morning.

The patient has received vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime in the emergency room due to lack of infection, but further antibiotics will be withheld unless signs of infection or positive culture data emerge. Urinalysis (u/a) is negative, and blood cultures and urine cultures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of hypertension and non-small cell lung cancer with brain and spine metastasis. She presented with altered mental status and persistent tachycardia. The patient was initially at Hospital3 and then transferred to Hospital1 for further care. At Hospital1, she was identified with a significant pulmonary embolism and started on heparin for anticoagulation after discussion with the oncology team.

24-hour events include the patient having persistent tachycardia, bandemia improving, a CT angiogram revealing a saddle embolus with extension to the right and left main pulmonary arteries, and the initiation of heparin treatment.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 mmHg to 84/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an input of 367 mL and an output of 190 mL through total infusions, with urine output being 90 mL. The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin and has a goal PTT of 60-80. The plan includes following up on coagulation studies, weaning oxygen as possible, pursuing the LENI study if anticoagulation remains difficult to maintain, evaluating right ventricular function and volume status using an echocardiogram, and discussing treatment timing implications with the oncology team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a large central thrombus with extension to the right and left main pulmonary arteries, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxia, right ventricular strain, and potential hemodynamic instability.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia can lead to complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and increased oxygen demand.
3. Lung cancer with brain and spine metastasis: The underlying malignancy poses a risk for additional thromboembolic events and can cause neurological complications due to metastatic lesions in the brain and spine.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hypoxia, sepsis, or other underlying causes and requires close monitoring for changes in consciousness or cognitive function.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical due to the presence of a significant pulmonary embolism, persistent tachycardia, and underlying malignancy. Close monitoring and management of coagulation status, oxygenation, hemodynamics, and neurological status are crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases. She presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's oxygen requirements have been stable, and her blood pressure has improved with fluid boluses. She is not a candidate for surgery or tissue plasminogen activator due to metastatic disease and high risk of bleeding. The patient's son is in agreement with her code status being full code, although the patient still wants to be a full code. The patient's urine output is low at 25 cc/hr. An echocardiogram shows right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and pulmonary artery hypertension, which is consistent with a pulmonary embolism. The patient is on heparin drip and is awaiting lovenox when she is stable. There are no plans to restart chemotherapy. The patient received an additional 500 cc at 9:30 pm for low urine output, and her JVP is not markedly elevated with crackles at the left base.

Potential Medical Complications:

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2126-10-22**] 10:34 AM
   Discussion yesterday with oncology, came to conclusion that risk of PE
   untreated was higher than risk of intracranial bleed, so started on
   heparin drip
   - o2 requirements stable [**10-22**], BP 90=> 80s
   Blood pressure much improved yesterday now in 130s systolic with fluid
   boluses.
   - didn't start antibiotics b/c could explain bands and shift with PE
   - chest x-ray unchanged
   - not candidate for surgery or tpa due to metastatic disease and likely
   at high risk to bleed
   - son is apparently reasonable about code status, however patient still
   wanting to be full code, will need to continue to readdress
   - urine output currently putting out 25 cc/hr

   - lovenox when she is stable per onc (lovenox shot then 4-6 hours later
   can d/c heparin - NOT YET)
   - onc - no plans to restart chemo right now, or maybe not at all in the
   future

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer and brain metastases. She presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's blood pressure has improved with fluid boluses, and she is currently on a heparin drip. Oxygenation goals are to maintain saturation above 90%, and the patient is currently saturating at 88-92% and tachypneic. An echocardiogram from October 22nd showed right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and pulmonary artery hypertension, which is likely due to the main pulmonary artery thrombus consistent with PE. Intravenous fluids appear to be helpful in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The patient's lung cancer is stage IV and has received brain irradiation with plans for cyber knife treatment. Oncology has no plans for chemotherapy at this time. The patient is also recommended to receive lovenox for the treatment of PE once medically stable. Her code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer and brain metastases. She presented with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient appears more comfortable breathing compared to the previous day, and her blood pressure has improved with fluid boluses. She is currently on a heparin drip, and it is planned to transition to lovenox when she is medically stable. Oxygenation goals are set at >90%, and she is currently saturating at 88-92% and tachypneic. Telemetry monitoring will be continued, along with close attention to IV fluid administration due to the compromised right ventricle. Nebulizers will be started to address wheezing on examination. Oncology consultation is recommended for further evaluation and management of her lung cancer, as she has progressive stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer and received a 15-day course of Navelbine treatment. There are no plans for chemotherapy at this time. The patient's code status is full code, and her dispositions are regular diet and repletion of electrolyte scales. She has two peripheral IV lines in place, and her son has been informed about her condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases. She presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and is found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure in the 130s systolic, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She appears more comfortable breathing compared to yesterday morning. The patient has been started on a heparin drip and will be bridged with lovenox once stable. She is currently hemodynamically stable with adequate oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a confirmed saddle PE, which can lead to further complications such as right ventricular strain, hypotension, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 130s systolic, indicating that she may be at risk for low blood pressure, especially considering the right ventricular strain from the PE.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient has crackles at the left base and wheezing on examination, indicating possible respiratory distress or worsening lung function.
4. Metastatic Lung Cancer: The patient has stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastases. The cancer may continue to progress and cause further complications.

   68yo woman with a h/o HTN and NSCCA-Lung with brain/spine mets who
   presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle PE. Started
   on heparin IV and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for monitoring / management .
   1)Pulmonary Embolism: Remains hemodynamically stable although
   persistently tachycardic. Oxygenation adequate on minimal
   supplementation. Likely safe to transition to Lovenox from Heparin gtt
   given her cardiopulmonary stability over the past 48 hours.
   2) Blood pressure: She has been aggressively volume resuscitated with
   stable SBPs. HR remains elevated. Will encourage PO intake and reserve
   IVF boluses for hypotension, should it occur.
   3) Onc: No plans for further chemo at this time, per Oncology.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet, encouraged increased PO.
   5) Pulmonary: Wheezing on exam today, continue standing nebs and
   monitor serial lung exams and x-ray. Suspect moderate obstructive
   disease, although pulmonary edema (in setting of aggressive volume
   resuscitation) may be playing a role. Inhaled beta-agonists may assist
   with this.
   6) Proph: SCDs, IV heparin. PPI. Colace, senna.
   7) Code: Remains full, confirmed yesterday.
   8) Dispo: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for now, if she remains hemodynamically stable then
   consider transfer to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and non-small cell lung cancer that has metastasized to the brain and spine. She presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently being treated with heparin IV and admitted to the ICU for monitoring and management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with persistent tachycardia. Oxygenation is adequate on minimal supplementation. The plan is to transition from heparin gtt to Lovenox.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient remains hemodynamically stable, but persistent tachycardia and low oxygen saturation may indicate ongoing pulmonary embolism. Monitoring for signs of deterioration and ensuring proper anticoagulation therapy is essential.
2. Hypotension: Aggressive volume resuscitation has stabilized blood pressures, but there is a risk of hypotension if fluid balance is not maintained. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary.
3. Oncological Complications: The patient's lung cancer may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or respiratory distress. Regular chest x-rays and respiratory support may be required.
4. Obstructive Disease: The presence of wheezing on examination suggests moderate obstructive disease. Inhaled beta-agonists may assist in managing this condition.
5. Pulmonary Edema: Aggressive volume resuscitation may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a chief complaint of saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). She has received approximately 2.5 liters of intravenous fluids over the past 24 hours, maintaining stable oxygenation and systolic blood pressure but persistently tachycardic in the 120s. The patient has started on a diet but is still taking in low oral intake. Family meetings have been held with the son, patient, and oncologist, and she remains full code.

Recent findings from the transthoracic echo show right ventricular cavity enlargement, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and free wall hypokinesis. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and has received antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone, in the past. She is currently on multiple medications, including heparin sodium, protonix, dexamethasone, colace, provigil, celexa, and atrovent nebs q6h with albuterol nebs PRN.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the 120s (sinus tachycardia), blood pressure ranging from 104/50 to 133/86 mmHg, respiratory rate in the 22s (18-36 inspirations per minute), and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula"

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo woman with a h/o HTN and NSCCA-Lung with brain/spine mets who
   presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle PE. Started
   on heparin IV and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for monitoring / management .
   1)Pulmonary Embolism: Remains hemodynamically stable although
   persistently tachycardic. Oxygenation adequate on minimal
   supplementation. Likely safe to transition to Lovenox from Heparin gtt
   given her cardiopulmonary stability over the past 48 hours.
   2) Blood pressure: She has been aggressively volume resuscitated with
   stable SBPs. HR remains elevated. Will encourage PO intake and reserve
   IVF boluses for hypotension, should it occur.
   3) Onc: No plans for further chemo at this time, per Oncology.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet, encouraged increased PO.
   5) Pulmonary: Wheezing on exam today, continue standing nebs and
   monitor serial lung exams and x-ray. Suspect moderate obstructive
   disease, although pulmonary edema (in setting of aggressive volume
   resuscitation) may be playing a role. Inhaled beta-agonists may assist
   with this.
   6) Proph: SCDs, IV heparin. PPI. Colace, senna.
   7) Code: Remains full, confirmed yesterday.
   8) Dispo: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for now, if she remains hemodynamically stable then
   consider transfer to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and non-small cell lung cancer with brain and spine metastasis. She presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently being monitored in the ICU for her condition.

24-hour events:
- The patient received approximately 2.5 liters of intravenous fluids over the past 24 hours.
- Her oxygenation and systolic blood pressure remained stable, but she continued to be tachycardic in the 120s.
- She started on a regular diet, but her oral intake remains low.
- Family meetings were held with the patient, son, and oncologist, and it was decided to keep her full code.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient remains hemodynamically stable, although persistently tachycardic. Her oxygenation is adequate on minimal supplementation. It is likely safe to transition her from heparin to low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) given her cardiopulmonary stability over the past 48 hours.
2. Blood pressure: The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated with stable systolic blood pressures. Her heart rate remains elevated. It is encouraged for her to increase oral intake and reserve intravenous fluid boluses for hypotension, if it occurs.
3. Oncology: No plans for further chemotherapy at this time, according to the oncology"

   68 yoF w/ a h/o Metastatic NSCLC with brain mets presents with
   palpitations and feeling unwell x 2 days and found to have a saddle PE.
   .
   # Pulmonary Embolism: Patient with known PE on CTA with tachycardia,
   right ventricular cavity hypokinesis on echo and pulm HTN. On lovenox,
   supplemental O2 and nebulizers. Seems improved from admission. Likely
   PEs will begin to resolve to some extent and allowing for better
   perfusion, respiration. She would benefit from working with physical
   therapy today. Although she is fluid positive, would not be too
   aggressive to diurese given her low BPs and unremarkable CXR.
   -          Continue lovenox
   -          Supplemental O2 with goal O2 sat >90%
   -          PT/OT today
   -          PRN nebs
   -          For tachycardia, consider d/c provigil if not necessary for
   primary CNS process (unclear why she is on this). It may help bring her
   HR down.
   .
   # Lung Cancer: Oncology following, appreciate recommendations. Per
   primary oncologist she will likely be ready for the oncology service
   today, tomorrow for further management.
   -f/u any new recommendations
   -continue lovenox
   -no chemotherapy at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. She presented with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's current condition includes right ventricular cavity hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has already been diagnosed with a PE, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, right ventricular strain or failure, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis, it is important to monitor for signs of DVT development or progression.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and caution must be exercised to avoid hypotension, especially during IV fluid administration.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++), should be closely monitored and managed to prevent any imbalances that could affect cardiac function or other vital organ systems.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated on some occasions, indicating the need for glycemic control to prevent complications associated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who presented with symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism and persistent tachycardia. The patient's respiratory distress from the previous day responded well to nebulizer treatment. Her blood pressure has stabilized after an IV fluid bolus, but her tachycardia remains unchanged. The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with Lovenox and will require long-term anticoagulation. Other findings include a left peri-hilar infiltrate on chest X-ray and normal lab results except for elevated troponin-T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is currently experiencing a PE, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, and potentially shock if not properly managed.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may indicate underlying cardiac issues or be a response to the PE. It is essential to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and consider further evaluation or intervention if necessary.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could suggest an infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued assessment of lab results are necessary to detect any signs of infection.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake of fluids but also a substantial output, indicating potential fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances. Regular monitoring of fluid status and"
