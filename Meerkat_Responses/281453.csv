   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Epigastric discomfort: Unlikely angina, given lack of worsening with
   exertion, lack of associated symptoms, such as chest pressure. Mild
   troponin elevation likely red [**Doctor Last Name 7040**] in setting of acute renal
   failure. In addition, recent coronary angiography did not demonstrate
   any significant coronary artery disease. Discomfort perhaps secondary
   to GERD, given associated increase in belching and bile taste in mouth.
   LFTs are w/i normal limits. In any case, it has resolved.
   - Monitor symptoms
   # Acute renal failure: Likely combination of two recent contrast
   studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
   medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing
   to increased Cr. She does report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO
   intake could also be partially to blame.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   - transfuse as below
   # Anemia: Not bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme
   chronically
   - Will transfuse today
   - Monitor for CHF symptoms today
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold furosemide, metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   # Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: No evidence of volume
   overload on exam, although does appear to ahve small bilateral pleural
   effusions on CXR.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
   # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week. Will touch base with CT surgery
   today to find out date of surgery.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-18**] ARF.
   - monitor
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues.
   # Chronic anemia: stable
   - continue iron supplementation

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS), systolic and diastolic dysfunction presenting with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, and anemia. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to her unstable medical condition. 

Key Findings:
1. The patient's Hct dropped from 29 to 25.1, likely due to dilutional effects.
2. Blood pressures have been consistently low, ranging from 80/50 to 97/54 mmHg. Bolus infusions of 250cc IV fluids have been administered to improve blood pressure.
3. The patient experienced nausea in the PM, which improved with zofran.
4. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her respiratory rate is within normal limits.
5. Her oxygen saturation is 91% on nasal cannula.
6. Laboratory results indicate acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels.
7. Troponin levels are mildly elevated, but significant coronary artery disease was not found during coronary angiography.
8. Liver function tests are within normal limits.
9. The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.
10. The patient's anemia is chronic and stable, but she requires transfusion.
11. The patient has hyperkalemia, likely secondary to acute renal failure.
12. The patient is planned for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) this week"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS), systolic and diastolic dysfunction, presenting with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, anemia, hypotension, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, hyperkalemia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and possibly TMP-SMX contributing to increased creatinine levels. It is important to monitor her renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly.

2. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which is not bleeding from the GI tract. It is planned to transfuse her today, and she should be monitored for congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms.

3. Hypotension: The patient's mild hypotension has resolved. However, it is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressure and administering IV fluids as needed.

4. Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: Although there is no evidence of volume overload on examination, the patient appears to have small bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray. It is crucial to manage her heart failure symptoms and optimize her cardiac function.

5. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Epigastric discomfort: Unlikely angina, given lack of worsening with
   exertion, lack of associated symptoms, such as chest pressure. Mild
   troponin elevation likely red [**Doctor Last Name 7040**] in setting of acute renal
   failure. In addition, recent coronary angiography did not demonstrate
   any significant coronary artery disease. Discomfort perhaps secondary
   to GERD, given associated increase in belching and bile taste in mouth.
   LFTs are w/i normal limits. In any case, it has resolved.
   - Monitor symptoms
   # Acute renal failure: Likely combination of two recent contrast
   studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
   medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing
   to increased Cr. She does report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO
   intake could also be partially to blame.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   - transfuse as below
   # Anemia: Not bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme
   chronically
   - Will transfuse today
   - Monitor for CHF symptoms today
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold furosemide, metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   # Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: No evidence of volume
   overload on exam, although does appear to ahve small bilateral pleural
   effusions on CXR.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
   # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week. Will touch base with CT surgery
   today to find out date of surgery.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-18**] ARF.
   - monitor
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
- She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, anemia, hypotension, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, and hyperkalemia.
- The patient had undergone coronary angiography and contrast CT study recently.
- Her symptoms have been managed with appropriate interventions such as IV fluids, medication adjustments, and transfusion.
- The patient is planned for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) this week.
- There is a mention of a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which TMP-SMX has been continued at once-daily dosing due to acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's chronic anemia has been stable and managed with iron supplementation.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored, particularly for hyperkalemia.
- The patient is on a low-salt diet and is receiving repletion of electrolytes as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's acute renal failure may be attributed to the recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), adherence to certain medications, and possibly TMP-SMX contributing to increased creatinine levels. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
2. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia, which is"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure: Likely combination of two recent contrast
   studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
   medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing
   to increased Cr. She does report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO
   intake could also be partially to blame.
   - hold valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   - transfuse as below
   # Dyspnea and Increasing O2 requirement:   Likely secondary to critical
   aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous will get
   LENIs to rule out DVT.  Concern for volume overload because have been
   holding lasix in setting of renal failure.
   - CXR this AM
   - Lasix IV 40mg today as developing CHF symptoms
   - Nebs PRN
   - Consider restarting metoprolol for tachycardia later today
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused yesterday, Hct increased appropriately
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week. Will touch base with CT surgery
   today to find out date of surgery, will likely not take in the setting
   of ARF.
    # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-18**] ARF.  Mild peaked T waves
   - Kayexalate given yesterday, made the patient nauseated
   - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues.
   - Change to ampicillin today.
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea:  Concern for bowel ischemia with
   critical AS, resolved.  Lactate wnl.  LFTs are w/i normal limits.  Most
   likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms
   - Ativan PRN for nausea

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction presenting with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, dyspnea, and increased oxygen requirement. She has a history of chronic heart failure, anemia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and bowel ischemia. The patient has undergone coronary angiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA). She is currently on several medications, including valsartan, lasix, metoprolol, TMP-SMX, iron supplementation, and ativan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which could be due to recent contrast studies, medication adherence, TMP-SMX use, or decreased oral intake.
2. Critical aortic stenosis and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirement may be secondary to her critical AS and chronic CHF. There is concern for volume overload due to the holding of lasix in the setting of renal failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's right lower extremity (RLE) edema is more pronounced than the left, which raises concern for DVT. Further evaluation with lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENIs) is planned.
4. Hypotension: The patient had"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Epigastric discomfort: Unlikely angina, given lack of worsening with
   exertion, lack of associated symptoms, such as chest pressure. Mild
   troponin elevation likely red [**Doctor Last Name 7040**] in setting of acute renal
   failure. In addition, recent coronary angiography did not demonstrate
   any significant coronary artery disease. Discomfort perhaps secondary
   to GERD, given associated increase in belching and bile taste in mouth.
   LFTs are w/i normal limits. In any case, it has resolved.
   - Monitor symptoms
   # Acute renal failure: Likely combination of two recent contrast
   studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
   medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing
   to increased Cr. She does report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO
   intake could also be partially to blame.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   - transfuse as below
   # Anemia: Not bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme
   chronically
   - Will transfuse today
   - Monitor for CHF symptoms today
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold furosemide, metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   # Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: No evidence of volume
   overload on exam, although does appear to ahve small bilateral pleural
   effusions on CXR.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week. Will touch base with CT surgery
   today to find out date of surgery.
    # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-18**] ARF.
   - monitor
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presented with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, anemia, hypotension, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient likely experienced acute renal failure due to a combination of recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and possibly TMP-SMX contributing to increased creatinine levels. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
2. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which is not bleeding from the GI tract. Transfusion plans have been made to address this condition. Monitoring for CHF symptoms is important, as the patient may develop congestive heart failure due to severe aortic stenosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient had mild hypotension, which has resolved. Holding certain medications and administering IV fluids as needed will help maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient has evidence of chronic systolic and diastolic dysfunction leading to heart failure. Close monitoring for any signs of volume overload is necessary, especially considering the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions on CXR.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, likely secondary to acute renal failure. Monitoring potassium levels and managing accordingly is crucial to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, presenting with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, anemia, hypotension, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic anemia, and hypernatremia. She has been admitted to the ICU and various interventions have been made to address her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could potentially worsen if the underlying causes are not properly managed. These causes include contrast studies, medication adherence, and TMP-SMX use.
2. Hypotension: The patient's mild hypotension may recur if fluid balance is not maintained adequately. Holding certain medications like furosemide, metoprolol, and valsartan can help in managing hypotension.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia needs close monitoring as it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications if not managed properly. Kayexalate has already been administered to address this issue.
4. UTI: The UTI should be treated promptly to prevent the spread of infection or complications such as sepsis.
5. Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure symptoms may worsen if her severe aortic stenosis is not managed appropriately,"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Epigastric discomfort: Unlikely angina, given lack of worsening with
   exertion, lack of associated symptoms, such as chest pressure. Mild
   troponin elevation likely red [**Doctor Last Name 7040**] in setting of acute renal
   failure. In addition, recent coronary angiography did not demonstrate
   any significant coronary artery disease. Discomfort perhaps secondary
   to GERD, given associated increase in belching and bile taste in mouth.
   LFTs are w/i normal limits. In any case, it has resolved.
   - Monitor symptoms
   # Acute renal failure: Likely combination of two recent contrast
   studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
   medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing
   to increased Cr. She does report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO
   intake could also be partially to blame.
   - hold furosemide, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   - transfuse as below
   # Anemia: Not bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme
   chronically
   - Will transfuse today
   - Monitor for CHF symptoms today
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold furosemide, metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   # Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure:  Now with crackles and
   slightly lower O2 sats. Concern for volume overload because have been
   holding lasix in setting of renal failure. Would favor continuing to
   hold lasix until has symptoms of CHFgiven ARF.
   - Continue to hold valsartan
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week. Will touch base with CT surgery
   today to find out date of surgery.
    # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-18**] ARF.
   - monitor
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues. Change to ampicillin.
   # Chronic anemia: stable
   - continue iron supplementation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, anemia, hypotension, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, and hyperkalemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and possibly TMP-SMX contributing to increased creatinine levels. It is important to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

2. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia not caused by bleeding from the GI tract. She will be transfused today, and it is crucial to monitor for congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced mild hypotension, which has resolved. Holding diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers may be necessary. Administering intravenous fluids as needed is also important.

4. Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient's heart failure has worsened, indicated by the presence of crackles and slightly lower oxygen saturation levels. It is necessary to continue holding diuretics until symptoms of CHF appear.

5. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient"

   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving, cause was likely combination of two
   recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with
   continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX. She
   did report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO intake could also have
   been partially to blame.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN (however patient has not required fluid in
   the past two days)
   - transfuse as below
   - Improved with some diuresis yesterday
   # Dyspnea:   Improved with diuresis yesterday.  Likely secondary to
   critical aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous
   will get LENIs to rule out DVT.  Concern for volume overload because
   have been holding lasix in setting of renal failure.
   - Lasix IV 40mg yesterday as was developing CHF symptoms
   - Nebs PRN
   - Will use lasix prn for SOB but will hold on daily dosing given
   preload dependence with AS
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct increased appropriately
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - consider small dose metoprolol as above and continue to hold
   valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
 Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider adding small dose beta blocker on her if bps can
   tolerate today
    # Hyperkalemia:  Likely [**2-18**] ARF.  Mild peaked T waves on EKG yesterday
   - Kayexalate and lasix yesterday improved.
   - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   # UTI:
   - Continue ampicillin until surgery
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea:  Concern for bowel ischemia with
   critical AS, resolved.  Lactate wnl.  LFTs are w/i normal limits.  Most
   likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms
   - Ativan PRN for nausea
   # FEN: Low-salt diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV
   # PPx: Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, and dyspnea. The acute renal failure is improving, likely due to the combination of recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and decreased oral intake. The patient's dyspnea has also improved with diuretics. She has a history of chronic anemia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition is being managed with various medications, including lasix for fluid balance and ampicillin for UTI prophylaxis. The plan is to hold valsartan, continue diuretics as needed, and plan for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) once renal function improves.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has experienced acute renal failure, which is likely due to the combination of recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and decreased oral intake. It is important to monitor her renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly.

2. Hypotension: The patient has mild hypotension, which has resolved. This could be due to her severe AS and chronic CHF. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary, and further interventions may be required if hypotension recurs.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving, cause was likely combination of two
   recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with
   continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX. She
   did report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO intake could also have
   been partially to blame.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN (however patient has not required fluid in
   the past two days)
   - transfuse as below
   - Improved with some diuresis yesterday
   # Dyspnea:   Improved with diuresis yesterday.  Likely secondary to
   critical aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous
   will get LENIs to rule out DVT.  Concern for volume overload because
   have been holding lasix in setting of renal failure.
   - Lasix IV 40mg yesterday as was developing CHF symptoms
   - Nebs PRN
   - Will use lasix prn for SOB but will hold on daily dosing given
   preload dependence with AS
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct increased appropriately
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - consider small dose metoprolol as above and continue to hold
   valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
 Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider adding small dose beta blocker on her if bps can
   tolerate today
    # Hyperkalemia:  Likely [**2-18**] ARF.  Mild peaked T waves on EKG yesterday
   - Kayexalate and lasix yesterday improved.
   - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   # UTI:
   - Continue ampicillin until surgery
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea:  Concern for bowel ischemia with

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, dyspnea, anemia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's renal function has improved, allowing for potential surgery. She is currently on various medications and treatments, including diuretics, transfusions, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's condition is being monitored closely, with plans for possible transfer to the coronary care unit (CCU) or floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and decreased oral intake may have contributed to acute renal failure. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely secondary to critical AS and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Close monitoring of fluid balance and administration of diuretics are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which requires ongoing iron supplementation. Transfusions have been given to improve her hematocrit levels appropriately.
4. Hypotension: Mild hypotension has resolved, but careful monitoring is still required. Small doses of beta blockers may be considered if tolerated.
5. Hyperkalemia:"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving, cause was likely combination of two
   recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with
   continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX. She
   did report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO intake could also have
   been partially to blame.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN (however patient has not required fluid in
   the past two days)
   - transfuse as below
   - Improved with some diuresis yesterday
   # Dyspnea and Increasing O2 requirement:   Improved with diuresis
   yesterday.  Likely secondary to critical aortic stenosis and chronic
   CHF, however as RLE more edematous will get LENIs to rule out DVT.
   Concern for volume overload because have been holding lasix in setting
   of renal failure.
   - Lasix IV 40mg yesterday as was developing CHF symptoms
   - Nebs PRN
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct increased appropriately
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
 Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
    # Hyperkalemia:  Improved, Likely [**2-18**] ARF.  Mild peaked T waves on EKG
   yesterday
   - Kayexalate given yesterday, made the patient nauseated
   - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues.
   - Continue ampicillin
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea:  Concern for bowel ischemia with
   critical AS, resolved.  Lactate wnl.  LFTs are w/i normal limits.  Most
   likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms
   - Ativan PRN for nausea

","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, presenting with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including acute renal failure, dyspnea, anemia, hypotension, aortic stenosis, hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and epigastric discomfort/nausea. 

The patient's recent history includes two contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), which may have contributed to her acute renal failure. Additionally, she has been taking medications including valsartan, lasix, TMP-SMX, ampicillin, and Ativan.

The patient's vital signs show mild hypotension, with a blood pressure of 92/49 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and she has an oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles and wheezes in her chest, indicative of respiratory distress. She also has a late-peaking III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, along with loss of S2. 

Her laboratory results indicate acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. She also has hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit are within"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, dyspnea, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient also has chronic anemia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her recent medical history includes syncope and plans for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, which may be postponed due to acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and decreased oral intake. ARF can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
2. Severe Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient's severe AS can progress to heart failure and may cause symptoms like syncope and dyspnea. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which requires iron supplementation. If left untreated, it can result in fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical intervention to prevent cardiac arr"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure: Likely combination of two recent contrast
   studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
   medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing
   to increased Cr. She does report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO
   intake could also be partially to blame.
   - hold valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
   - transfuse as below
   # Dyspnea and Increasing O2 requirement:   Likely secondary to critical
   aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous will get
   LENIs to rule out DVT.  Concern for volume overload because have been
   holding lasix in setting of renal failure.
   - CXR this AM
   - Lasix IV 40mg today as developing CHF symptoms
   - Nebs PRN
   - Consider restarting metoprolol for tachycardia later today
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused yesterday, Hct increased appropriately
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - hold metoprolol, valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week. Will touch base with CT surgery
   today to find out date of surgery, will likely not take in the setting
   of ARF.
    # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-18**] ARF.  Mild peaked T waves
   - Kayexalate given yesterday, made the patient nauseated
   - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   # UTI: continue TMP/SMX at once-daily dosing given ARF. Call micro labs
   for sensitivities so may be able to change antibiotics for less renal
   dosing issues.
   - Change to ampicillin today.
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea:  Concern for bowel ischemia with
   critical AS, resolved.  Lactate wnl.  LFTs are w/i normal limits.  Most
   likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms
   - Ativan PRN for nausea
   # FEN: Low-salt diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV
   # PPx: Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, dyspnea, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has a history of chronic CHF, anemia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and UTI. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's recent contrast studies and medication adherence may have contributed to her acute renal failure. It is important to monitor her renal function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
2. Dyspnea and Increasing O2 Requirement: The patient's dyspnea and increased oxygen requirement could be secondary to her critical AS and chronic CHF. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and ongoing management of her CHF symptoms are essential.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's edematous condition raises concerns about volume overload, especially with the recent holding of Lasix due to renal failure. Monitoring her fluid balance and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed will be crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient's mild hypotension has resolved, but it is important to remain vigilant for any signs of recurrent hypotension and promptly address it with appropriate interventions.
5. Anemia: The patient has a chronic issue of anemia, which is being managed with iron supplementation. Monitoring her hemoglobin levels and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. Vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with oxygen saturation at 99%. There are bilateral crackles and wheezes in the chest. On examination, there is a late-peaking systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, along with loss of S2. The extremities are cool and clammy, with absent pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and decreased hemoglobin. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, renal failure, nausea/vomiting, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving various medications, including furosemide and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the aortic valve, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac arrest.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Acute renal failure can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, infection, or medication toxicity. Complications may include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin appears warm and without"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  [**2-18**] recent contrast studies (coronary
   angiography and CTA) . Cre improved to 1.3 today.
   - Steadily improving despite diuretic therapy over last few days.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   # Dyspnea:   Improved with diuresis yesterday.  Likely secondary to
   critical aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous
   will get LENIs to rule out DVT.
   - Lasix IV 40mg PRN for SOB but will exert caution given preload
   dependence and AS
   - Nebs PRN
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct stable
   # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
   - Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
   - metoprolol to maximize diastolic filling time (as BPs allow)
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely [**2-18**] ARF and improving with creatinine
   improvement
   - Kayexalate PRN, low potassium diet
   # UTI:
   - Continue ampicillin until surgery
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea: Most likely secondary to renal failure

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS), systolic and diastolic dysfunction, presenting with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 to 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is currently receiving various medications including metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium. Her laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as anemia. The patient's renal function is improving, with a decrease in creatinine from 2.8 to 1.6 mg/dL. She is also being managed for dyspnea, anemia, AS, hyperkalemia, UTI, epigastric discomfort/nausea, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance. The patient's code status is full, and she is currently in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent contrast studies and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Continued monitoring of renal function and adjustment of diuretic therapy may be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Severe a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure. The acute renal failure is improving, likely due to a combination of recent contrast studies, medication adherence, and possibly TMP-SMX. The patient's dyspnea has improved with diuretic therapy, but there is concern for volume overload. Anemia is a chronic issue, and the patient is on iron supplementation. Severe AS is leading to heart failure, and the patient is planned for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) this week. Hyperkalemia is likely related to acute renal failure, and the patient has mild peaked T waves on EKG. A urinary tract infection is being treated with ampicillin until surgery. The patient also experiences epigastric discomfort and nausea, which are likely secondary to renal failure. The patient is responding well to Asian PRN for nausea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is improving, but there is a risk of further deterioration or incomplete recovery.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has concerns for volume overload due to diuretic therapy and severe AS.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may worsen without appropriate management.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving, cause was likely combination of two
   recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with
   continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX. She
   did report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO intake could also have
   been partially to blame.
   - Steadily improving despite diuretic therapy over last few days.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   # Dyspnea:   Improved with diuresis yesterday.  Likely secondary to
   critical aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous
   will get LENIs to rule out DVT.  Concern for volume overload because
   have been holding lasix in setting of renal failure.
   - Lasix IV 40mg PRN for SOB but will hold on daily dosing given preload
   dependence with AS
   - Nebs PRN
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct stable X several days
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
 Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
   - metoprolol to maximize diastolic filling time (as BPs allow)
    # Hyperkalemia:  Likely [**2-18**] ARF and improving with creatinine
   improvement
   - Kayexalate PRN, low potassium diet
   # UTI:
   - Continue ampicillin until surgery
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea: Most likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms
   - Patient has responded well to ativan PRN for nausea

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunction who presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure. The patient's conditions include acute renal failure, dyspnea, anemia, aortic stenosis, hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), epigastric discomfort/nausea, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening renal failure: The patient has already experienced acute renal failure, which can lead to further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, and it may drop further due to diuretic therapy or other factors.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyperkalemia, but there is a risk of developing other electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia or hyponatremia.
4. Infection: Although the patient is on antibiotics for the UTI, there is still a risk of developing other infections, especially in the ICU setting.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure, likely secondary to recent contrast studies. Her creatinine level has improved to 1.6, and she is showing signs of improvement with diuretic therapy. The patient's dyspnea has also improved with diuretics, but caution should be exercised due to preload dependence and aortic stenosis. Anemia is a chronic issue for the patient, and she is being treated with iron supplementation. Severe aortic stenosis has led to heart failure and a recent admission for syncope. The patient is planned for aortic valve replacement this week, and metoprolol is being used to maximize diastolic filling time. Hyperkalemia is likely due to acute renal failure and is improving with creatinine improvement. The patient is being monitored for UTI, epigastric discomfort/nausea (likely secondary to renal failure), and is on a low-salt diet. She has a 20-gauge PIV line and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is to CCU.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving, cause was likely combination of two
   recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with
   continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX. She
   did report mild nausea as well, so decreased PO intake could also have
   been partially to blame.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN (however patient has not required fluid in
   the past two days)
   - transfuse as below
   - Improved with some diuresis yesterday
   # Dyspnea:   Improved with diuresis yesterday.  Likely secondary to
   critical aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous
   will get LENIs to rule out DVT.  Concern for volume overload because
   have been holding lasix in setting of renal failure.
   - Lasix IV 40mg yesterday as was developing CHF symptoms
   - Nebs PRN
   - Will use lasix prn for SOB but will hold on daily dosing given
   preload dependence with AS
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct increased appropriately
   # Hypotension: Mild, resolved
   - consider small dose metoprolol as above and continue to hold
   valsartan
   - administer 250 cc IVF PRN
    # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
 Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider adding small dose beta blocker on her if bps can
   tolerate today
    # Hyperkalemia:  Likely [**2-18**] ARF.  Mild peaked T waves on EKG yesterday
   - Kayexalate and lasix yesterday improved.
   - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   # UTI:
   - Continue ampicillin until surgery
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea:  Concern for bowel ischemia with
   critical AS, resolved.  Lactate wnl.  LFTs are w/i normal limits.  Most
   likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms
   - Ativan PRN for nausea
   # FEN: Low-salt diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV
   # PPx: Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, dyspnea, anemia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and a urinary tract infection. The patient has undergone coronary angiography and a contrast-enhanced CT scan recently, which may have contributed to the acute renal failure. She is currently in the ICU for management of her critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed appropriately. This could lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic valve is severely narrowed, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This can cause symptoms such as chest pain, syncope, and heart failure.
3. Chronic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which may be exacerbated by the severe aortic stenosis and other comorbidities. This can result in fluid retention, pulmonary congestion, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has an elevated potassium level, which can be dangerous and may require urgent treatment to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which needs to be addressed to prevent complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction who presents with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure. Her creatinine level has improved to 1.1 today. The patient's dyspnea is likely secondary to critical AS and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). She is stable with no lasix required, but will be used cautiously due to preload dependence and AS. Nebulizers are used as needed for shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has chronic anemia, for which she receives iron supplementation. Her hematocrit (HCT) remains stable after a transfusion on [**2104-5-4**]. The patient's severe AS has led to heart failure, and she is planned for aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Monday. She is on metoprolol to maximize diastolic filling time (as BPs allow). The patient is also being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with ampicillin until surgery, and her elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is being investigated. She is on a low-salt diet and receives electrolyte replenishment as needed. The patient has a peripheral intravenous (PIV) line and is on bowel regimen and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   89 yo woman with severe AS, systolic and diastolic dysfunction presents
   with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure.
   # Acute renal failure:  [**2-18**] recent contrast studies (coronary
   angiography and CTA) . Cre improved to 1.3 today.
   - Steadily improving despite diuretic therapy over last few days.
   - continue to hold valsartan
   # Dyspnea:   Improved with diuresis yesterday.  Likely secondary to
   critical aortic stenosis and chronic CHF, however as RLE more edematous
   will get LENIs to rule out DVT.
   - Lasix IV 40mg PRN for SOB but will exert caution given preload
   dependence and AS
   - Nebs PRN
   # Anemia: Chronic issue, on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Not
   bleeding from GI tract (guaiac neg) and followed by heme chronically
   - Transfused [**2104-5-4**], Hct stable
   # AS: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for
   syncope. Planned to have AVR this week.
   - Will contact CT surgery again today as renal failure improving.
   - metoprolol to maximize diastolic filling time (as BPs allow)
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely [**2-18**] ARF and improving with creatinine
   improvement
   - Kayexalate PRN, low potassium diet
   # UTI:
   - Continue ampicillin until surgery
   # Epigastric discomfort/Nausea: Most likely secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor symptoms

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presented with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure, which improved with conservative management. The patient's dyspnea is likely secondary to critical AS and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). She is currently stable and receiving nebulizer treatments as needed. The patient has chronic anemia and is on iron supplementation. Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) remains stable after a recent blood transfusion. Severe AS has led to heart failure and a recent admission for syncope. The patient is planned for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Monday. She is being managed with metoprolol to maximize diastolic filling time. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is receiving ampicillin until surgery. Her fluid balance shows a negative balance of 710 mL in the past 24 hours. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/43 to 95/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, and PaO2 of 104 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals a late-peaking III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border and loss of S2. Decreased breath sounds bilaterally with scattered crackles are also noted. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, but they have improved to 1.1 today. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, sodium, potassium, and glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's plan includes continuing to hold valsartan, providing lasix IV as needed for shortness of breath while exercising caution due to preload dependence and AS, using nebs PRN, and planning for AVR on Monday. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction who presented with epigastric discomfort and acute renal failure. She also has chronic anemia, dyspnea likely secondary to critical AS and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of syncope. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 95/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals a late-peaking III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border with loss of S2, decreased breath sounds bilaterally with scattered crackles, and no wheezing. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other medications. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab values, including glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes holding valsartan due to acute renal failure, using lasix IV for dyspnea but with caution due to preload dependence and AS,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She presents with epigastric discomfort, acute renal failure, and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are some fluctuations in blood pressure. Her respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and her oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury with improving creatinine levels, anemia, hyperkalemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent contrast studies may have contributed to the development of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of treatment accordingly is crucial.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely secondary to critical aortic stenosis and chronic congestive heart failure. Preload dependence and aortic stenosis need to be considered while managing her symptoms with diuretics.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and iron supplementation is ongoing. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is important.
4. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient's severe AS is leading to heart failure and syncope. Aortic valve replacement is planned, but careful consideration should be given due to the patient's improving renal function.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is"
