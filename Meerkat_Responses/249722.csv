","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU for detoxification due to EtOH withdrawal. He presented with symptoms such as tachycardia, agitation, tremors, and wheezing, for which he was given solumedrol and benzodiazepines. The patient remains anxious and wants to return to the detox center. His allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are noted. His medical history includes EtOH abuse, alcohol hepatitis, and COPD. The review of systems shows dyspnea and emesis. The patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, are within normal limits, with a slightly elevated SpO2 level. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has clear breath sounds. Physical examination findings include a thin appearance, normal conjunctiva, normocephalic head, clear chest sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, absent peripheral pulses, and no jaundice. Neurologic examination reveals the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to time, place, and person. Lab results show elevated ALT and AST levels, negative fluid analysis for toxins, pending TSH, and unremarkable ECG. The patient's condition is being managed with valium CIWA for acute EtOH withdrawal, gentle IV fluids, thiamine, and eventual transfer back to detox. COPD management includes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD and alcohol dependence. She presented with delirium tremens, likely due to alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/113 to 102/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is not showing any signs of acute respiratory distress. Her labs show slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal with Valium and IV fluids. Her COPD is mild and currently asymptomatic. There are concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to esophageal varices, given her alcohol abuse and liver disease. Liver function tests are abnormal, with an ALT higher than AST, which is atypical for alcohol-related liver disease. The patient's history also includes hypothyroidism. She is being monitored for improvement as alcohol withdrawal is treated. The patient's nutritional needs are being met, and her blood sugar is well controlled. The patient is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. Her code status is full code, and she is planned for transfer to the floor once stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD and EtOH dependence.
- She presented with delirium tremens, likely due to alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient is currently at the peak of withdrawal and does not have any evidence of alternate causes for her tremor and confusion.
- She does not require valium at this time.
- A social worker consultation has been requested, and the consideration of psychiatric involvement may be necessary.
- The patient has a history of high levels of free T4 and undetectable TSH, indicating possible thyroid dysfunction.
- An endocrinologist should be called to further evaluate this condition.
- The patient's heart rate is gradually coming down, so beta-blockers may not be needed at this time.
- Her liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, which are atypical for alcohol-related liver disease.
- It is unclear whether the liver abnormalities are acute or chronic, especially given the patient's prior medical history.
- The patient also has low platelet counts, suggesting a chronic process.
- Hepatitis serologies are negative, and the INR is within normal range.
- The patient's COPD is mild, as she is not on any medications, and her admission bicarbonate level was normal.
- Ipratroprium can be used as needed, but further systemic steroids should be avoided.
- The patient has experienced no episodes of emesis, and her guiac test is negative"
