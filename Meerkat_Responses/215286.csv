   24 Hour Events:
   Patient with transfer to medical floor--now returning with evolving
   sepsis.
   During medical floor admission--patient had ongoing evalation for
   possible sources of adenopathy.
   Today--patient has evolved significant-->
   Worsening lactic acidosis with anion gap elevated at 20
   He has evolved significant decrease in blood pressure to SBP=104
   and in the setting of hyponatremia and worsening renal function is
   admitted to ICU for further care

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male who is s/p renal transplant and initially presenting with
   feve of unknown origin.  He has possible diagnosis of PTLD raised given
   adenopathy and markedly elevated LDH in the setting of relative
   stability in terms of blood pressure, heart rate at initial ICU stay.
   Now, on the medical floor patient has evolved significant acidosis and
   worsening blood pressure in the setting of significant tachypnea.  This
   is all consistent with evolving sepsis.  The possible sources are
   extensive and do include bacterial sources as antibiotics had been
   discontinued for a time during admission.  Fungal sepsis is possible in
   the setting of chronic immunosupression.  In addition disseminated TB
   must be considered.  Despite this differential no cultures have
   returned positive to date.  Certainly malignancy--either PTLD or
   possibly related to thickened GB is also possible.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Continue broad spectrum ABX
   Add Fluconazole now
   CVL to be placed to allow rapid volume support
   -Will have to follow up on final CT read but no focal source of
   infection identified
   -Will need LN biopsy for aid in diagnosis
   2)Acidosis-
   -This is significant and clearly lactic acidosis related
   -Support for Sepsis as above
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Is likely a component of pre-renal failure but with elevated urine Na
   certainly intrinsic renal dysfunction is likely
   -Send U/A for casts
   -Support volume
   -No further dye loads
   4)Hyponatremia-
   Will replace volume
   WIll use 3% Saline for decrease in Na given elevated urine OSMS
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant presenting with sepsis, hyponatremia, and worsening renal function. The patient's condition has been evolving over time, with significant worsening lactic acidosis, elevated anion gap, decreased blood pressure, and tachypnea. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to an infection. The patient's fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension are indicative of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection remains unidentified, making it crucial to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and further investigations to identify the causative agent.

2. Acidosis: The patient is experiencing lactic acidosis, which is a type of metabolic acidosis caused by the buildup of lactic acid in the body. This condition requires immediate attention and management, including supportive care for sepsis as mentioned earlier.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to pre-renal failure exacerbated by sepsis. Intrinsic renal dysfunction is also possible, as indicated by elevated urine sodium levels. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate supportive measures are necessary.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has"

   24 Hour Events:
   Transfer note:
   62M with PMH of kidney transplant3 years ago for IgA nephropathy on
   chronic prednisone, cellcept and cyclosporin who was intially admitted
   to the ICU for fever and lactate>7.  With volume resuscitation, his
   lactate trended down and he was transferred to the floor on [**4-14**].  CT
   scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed mesenteric and retroperitoneal
   lymphadenopathy measuring up to 2cm, concerning for PTLD v lymphoma.
   Heme-onc was consulted and recommened excisional lymph node biopsy for
   diagnosis.  The patient is being followed by renal and ID as well.
   This morning the patient's lactate began to rise with a worsening
   acidosis.  He was persistently febrile.  Cefepime was restarted but his
   white count and lactate continued to trend up.  The patient was
   transferred back to the ICU for evolving sepsis.

   Changes to medical and family history:
   History of Present Illness: This is a 62 yo M with pmh of kidney
   transplant in [**Country 297**] 3 years ago who has been in the US for the last 4
   months and is experiencing intermittent fevers to 102 without source
   for the last week. He was at [**Hospital1 1200**] for these fevers for the last 3
   days without a diagnosis and has continued to experience fevers at
   home. There he was given Zosyn without improvement. He therefore
   presented to the ED for further evaluation.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS were 99.2 101 18 136/83 97% on RA. His blood work
   revealed a lactate of 7.5, an LDH of 2635 and an AG acidosis. He also
   had a leukocytosis with left shift. He spiked a fever to 102.6 and was
   given tylenol 1 gm, vanc/cefepime given concern for fever in the
   setting of immunocomprise. He rec'd a total of 4L of NS. His lactate
   came down to 5.4. He was HD throughout his ED stay, but given his
   elevated lactate, he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
   .
   On the floor, the patient has no complaints other than fatigue. He is
   accompanied by his son who is translating. He is quite concerned about
   the function of his transplanted kidney. He does report increased
   frequency of urination with decrease volume of urine for the last 4
   days. No burning with urination. No tenderness over his transplant
   site. He notes drinking fluid regularly but endorses some decreased PO
   over the last week due to disintrest. No other complaints.

   This is a 62 yo M with history of renal transplant and hypertension who
   is presented with one week of high fevers and lactate >7. The patient
   now returns to the ICU with evolving sepsis.  CT abd/pel showed marked
   lymphadenopathy concerning for PTLD versus lymphoma.  The source of the
   patient's elevated lactate is still unclear, differential includes
   tumor lysis v ischemia.  Infectious source could include bacteria in
   the absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use,
   disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given radiographic
   evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.

   # Fever/Leukocytosis/Sepsis:  Etiologies could include bacteria in the
   absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use,
   disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given radiographic
   evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.  Lactate could also be due to
   tumor lysis. Uric acid and potassium are elevated supporting tumor
   lysis
   - Follow up blood, urine cultures
   - CIS
   - Consider LP for further FUO work up
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] cefepime, add vanc and fluconazole
   - f/u final read CT
   - general surgery for excisional lymph node biopsy
   - CVL for rapid volume repletion
   - f/u EBV PCR
   - f/u CMV and HVC viral load
   - aggressive fluids
   .
   # Acidosis - Likely due to sepsis as above but could also be due to
   tumor lysis if this is, in fact, a lymphoma.  CK low so muscle not
   likley source of lactate.
   - continue fluids and support for sepsis as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   #  Hyponatremia - Pt given large volume of free D5W today.  Urine osms
   and Na high.  Will challenge with normal saline.
   - continue NS resuscitation if Na responds to bolus, switch to 3%
   saline if Na down
   .
   # Elevated LDH: Differential includes hemolysis, malignancy such as
   lymphoma, PTLD, PCP/histoplasmosis or other fungal infections. No
   history of malignancy, though he would be at risk for PCP in given
   immunosuppression.
   - appreciate heme-onc consult

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 62-year-old male with a history of kidney transplant presents with a week of intermittent fevers.
- Initially admitted to the ICU for fever and elevated lactate levels.
- CT scan revealed mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, concerning for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or lymphoma.
- Patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin but continued to have rising lactate levels and persistent fever.
- Transferred back to the ICU for evolving sepsis.
- The patient has a history of renal failure and hypertension.
- Other lab findings include elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal blood glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including fever and elevated lactate levels, suggest a systemic infection leading to sepsis.
2. PTLD or Lymphoma: The presence of lymphadenopathy on the CT scan raises concerns for PTLD or lymphoma, which can be associated with immunosuppression in transplant patients.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and potassium levels may indicate tumor lysis syndrome, especially if the patient has a malignancy such as lymphoma.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's history of renal transplant and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and hypertension. He presents with one week of high fevers and elevated lactate levels. The patient returns to the ICU with evolving sepsis. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed marked lymphadenopathy concerning for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) versus lymphoma. The source of the patient's elevated lactate is still unclear, with a differential including tumor lysis versus ischemia. Infectious sources could include bacteria in the absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use, disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given radiographic evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of evolving sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's elevated lactate levels and uric acid, along with the presence of lymphadenopathy on imaging, raise suspicion for tumor lysis syndrome. This condition can lead to metabolic abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently experiencing kidney dysfunction. It is important to monitor renal function closely and manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances appropriately.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient is experiencing hypoglycemia, which may be due to tumor burden or hepatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of appropriate glucose supplementation will be necessary.

5. Hematemesis: The patient has a history of coffee grounds hematemesis and a positive guaiac test. This suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be due to an ulcer or another underlying cause. Continued monitoring and evaluation for further bleeding episodes are important.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation will be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has multiple electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. These imbalances can lead to various complications if not corrected promptly.

8. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to immunosuppression from medications and his renal transplant status. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are crucial.

9. PTLD/Lymphoma: The patient's lymphadenopathy raises concern for PTLD or lymphoma. Further evaluation, such as biopsy, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

10. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's hypoglycemia may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which can have various causes including tumor burden or drug-induced liver injury. Monitoring liver function"

   62M with history of renal transplant; admitted in setting of fevers and
   lactic acidosis who has evolved over the course of the last several
   days with persistent fevers, hypoglycemia, relative hypotension.
   Suspect possible PTLD or lymphoma with tumor lysis sydrome given
   markedly elevated LDH, uric acid, lymphadenopathy.  Plans to go to OR
   today for biopsy.   Following biopsy, will likely start steroids for
   lymphoma.
   - To OR this afternoon for biopsy; likely ex-lap given abdominal LAD.
   - Heme-onc following; possible treatment with steroids following
   biopsy; path will be reviewed intraoperatively.
   - Continue antibiotics given concern for possible infectious etiology.
   2. Hypoglycemia:
    - given persistent hypoglycemia, possibly related to tumor lysis or
   infectious process. Will start D50 drip.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant. He was admitted with fevers and lactic acidosis and has since developed persistent fevers, hypoglycemia, and relative hypotension. The patient is suspected to have PTLD or lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome, as indicated by the markedly elevated LDH and uric acid levels. He is scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy and biopsy today, after which he may receive steroids for lymphoma treatment. The patient also has hypoglycemia, which may be related to tumor lysis or an infectious process. He has a history of renal transplant in [Country 297] three years ago and is currently on immunosuppression medication. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/66 mmHg to 102/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm. Physical examination findings include poor dentition, distended abdomen, and anxious appearance. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated lactate, and decreased potassium levels. The patient's blood cultures were collected on [2141-4-14] at 01:52 AM and repeated on [2141-4-15] at 05:17 PM, 09:12 PM, and 12:20 AM, with no significant growth observed. His urine output has been variable. The patient's condition requires aggressive hydration due to possible tumor lysis and the need for fluid boluses. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension could indicate a possible infectious etiology, leading to sepsis.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low glucose levels require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
3. Renal failure: Given the patient's history of renal transplant and the potential for tumor lysis syndrome, there is a risk of renal dysfunction or failure.
4. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's elevated LDH, uric acid, and lymphadenopathy suggest the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to metabolic imbalances and renal dysfunction.
5. Lymphoma/PTLD progression: If the patient is diagnosed with lymphoma or PTLD, there is a risk of disease progression and associated complications.
6. Surgical risks: The patient is scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy and biopsy, which carries its own risks, such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical progress to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant, admitted to the ICU due to fevers and lactic acidosis. He has been experiencing persistent fevers, hypoglycemia, and relative hypotension. There is suspicion of possible PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder) or lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome, given the elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and uric acid levels, as well as lymphadenopathy. The patient will undergo an exploratory laparotomy for biopsy today, and it is likely that steroids will be started for lymphoma treatment post-biopsy. The patient also requires continuous antibiotic therapy due to the concern for an infectious etiology. Other issues include hypoglycemia, which may be related to tumor lysis or an infectious process, and the need for aggressive hydration. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is currently in the 70-80 range, and close monitoring of UOP (urine output), BP (blood pressure), and CVP (central venous pressure) will be done to determine fluid boluses. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and relative hypotension suggest a possible infectious process, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low glucose levels indicate hypogly"

   This is a 62 yo M with history of renal transplant and hypertension who
   is presented with one week of high fevers and lactate >7. The patient
   now returns to the ICU with possible evolving sepsis.  CT abd/pel
   showed marked lymphadenopathy concerning for PTLD versus lymphoma.  The
   source of the patient's elevated lactate is still unclear, differential
   includes tumor lysis v ischemia.  Infectious source could include
   bacteria in the absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid
   use, disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given
   radiographic evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis/Sepsis:  Etiologies could include bacteria in the
   absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use,
   disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given radiographic
   evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.  Lactate could also be due to
   tumor lysis. Uric acid and potassium are elevated supporting tumor
   lysis
   - Follow up blood, urine cultures
   - CIS
   - Consider LP for further FUO work up
   - continue cefepime, add vanc and fluconazole
   - general surgery for excisional lymph node biopsy
   - CVL
   - f/u EBV PCR
   - f/u CMV and HVC viral load
   - aggressive fluid, with monitoring BP / CVP
   - Heme recs
   - ID recs: switch to [**Last Name (un) **] from cefipime
   - Renal transplant recs: stop immunosuppression EXCEPT for steroids
   - General surgery recs
   # Acidosis - Likely due to sepsis as above but could also be due to
   tumor lysis if this is, in fact, a lymphoma.  CK low so muscle not
   likley source of lactate.
   - continue fluids and support for sepsis as above
   - trend lactate
   - bicarb gtt, CVVH
   - Ventilator set at 28 rate to blow down pCO2, monitor for auto-PEEP
   #  Hyponatremia - Pt given large volume of free D5W today.  Urine osms
   and Na high.  Will challenge with normal saline.
   - continue NS resuscitation if Na responds to bolus, switch to 3%
   saline if Na down
   .
   # Hypoglycemia - possibly due to tumor burden v hepatic dysfunction.
   - glucose gtt, D5W but consider D10
   .
   # Elevated LDH: Differential includes hemolysis, malignancy such as
   lymphoma, PTLD, PCP/histoplasmosis or other fungal infections. No
   history of malignancy, though he would be at risk for PCP in given
   immunosuppression.
   - appreciate heme-onc consult
   - uric acid and K elevated, c/w tumor lysis but phos low
   - continue fluconazole
   # Kidney disease s/p transplant: Has history of renal transplant in
   [**Country 297**] 3 years ago. [**Month (only) 51**] be prerenal in the setting of
   hypovolemia/infection, though may be baseline. Stable over the last few
   days at [**Hospital1 **] (was up to 1.6 there, now back down to 1.3). Patient
   did bring in records of his creatinine over time in [**Country 297**], units in
   umol/dL.  Elevated urine Na may also suggest a component of intinisic
   renal dysfunction.  If this is tumor lysis, concern for urate
   nephropathy.
   - urine lytes. FeNa
   - Continue IVF resuscitation as above
   - Follow UOP  very closely
   - Continue prednisone, cyclosporin and cellcept
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - no further contrast dye if possible
   #  Hematemesis - coffee grounds an some bright red blood 3/21, guaiac
   positive.  Per chart, has prior history of ulcer.  NGT to suction
   without evidence of further bleeding.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor HCT
   - consider GI consult
   # HTN: Patient currently hypotensive on pressors (Neo & vasopressin).
   - Given patient's unclear picture and current HD stability, will hold
   nifedipine CR for now. Can restart if becomes hypertensive
   .
   # FEN:  aggressive IVFs, electrolytes prn,  NPO for surgery
   # Prophylaxis: [**Name (NI) 6433**], PPI, Pt's neice reports a ""reaction"" to
   heparin in the past, bleeding somewhere but not HIT.  Has active T&S

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and hypertension. He presents with one week of high fevers and elevated lactate levels. The patient is now in the ICU with possible evolving sepsis. CT abdomen/pelvis showed marked lymphadenopathy concerning for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) versus lymphoma. The source of the patient's elevated lactate is still unclear, with differential diagnoses including tumor lysis syndrome, ischemia, or an infectious source such as bacteria, fungemia, disseminated tuberculosis, strongyloidiasis, or cholecystitis.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including shock, acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, fever of unknown origin, chronic renal failure, and hypertension.

The assessment and plan include:
- Follow-up blood, urine cultures
- Consideration for excisional lymph node biopsy
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation with monitoring of blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP)
- Trending lactate levels
- Bicarbonate infusion and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)
- Ventilator settings adjustment to blow down carbon dioxide (CO2) and monitor for auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP)
- Challenge with normal saline for hyponatremia
- Glucose infusion and consideration of dextrose 10% (D10) for"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown origin. The patient has undergone multiple interventions and procedures, including invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, dialysis catheter placement, and central venous pressure monitoring. 

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic renal failure, lymphadenopathy, anemia, coagulopathy, and recent surgery. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, shock, acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and fever of unknown origin. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 77/51 mmHg), tachycardia (HR: 80 bpm), tachypnea (RR: 28 breaths/min), and hypothermia (Tcurrent: 35.8°C). The patient is unresponsive and sedated, with diminished radial pulses but present digital pulses. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis (WBC: 29.9 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (Plt: 88 K/uL), elevated creatinine (Cr: 1.8 mg/dL), hyponatremia (Na+: 9 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 5.1 mEq/L), hypoglycemia (Glucose: 34 mg/dL), and elevated lactate levels (Lactic Acid: 20.2 mmol/L). 

Radiology images reveal multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes, with the most likely possibilities being lymphoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Additionally, there is marked gallbladder wall edema likely related to third spacing. 

The patient's treatment plan includes ongoing support with vasopressin, phenylephrine, and CRRT. Antibiotics have been initiated, and further cultures and biopsies are pending. The patient's family has provided consent for an open lymph node biopsy, and an abdominal exploration was performed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and respiratory distress syndrome. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to treatment in order to manage these complications effectively."

   - Final CT A/P W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2141-4-13**] 11:19 PM
   1. Multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes. The most
   likely possibilities are lymphoma and post-transplant
   lymphoproliferative disorder. Several nodes are accessible for
   percutaneous sampling by CT guidance.
   2. Marked gallbladder wall edema likely relates to third spacing.
   - Renal Transplant recs: cyclosporine 50mg po Q12 while on Fluconazole,
   continue IVF, check haptoglobin level, check AM cyclosporine level
   - ID recs: Continue current antibiotics, send lymphnode for bacterial
   culture, fungal culture and AFB testing; unlikely that extrapulmonary
   TB would present with such decompensation, starting treatment overnight
   would not change course so rec await further data
   - Heme-onc recs: to open lymphnode biopsy, await results; could
   consider steroids empirically if clinically worsens, though this is not
   ideal given concern for infectious etiology
   - Bone marrow biopsy performed at bedside by Heme-Onc: preliminary
   without clonality
   - Surgery recs: patient consented, active T&C; post-op consider Echo
   for hemodynamic analysis, check bladder pressure to r/o abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Hypoglycemic: ?sepsis vs tumor burden, started on D10 gtt then
   transitioned to [**1-27**] pushes PRN to minimize IVF
   - Laproscopic evaluation: revealed free fluid that appeared was
   heterogeneous, studded liver; obtained bx of lymphnodes, liver and sent
   fluid for studies
   - Preliminary path: No evidence of clonality on flow, touch prep
   without monocellular component, cannot clearly rule-out lymphoma but no
   informatin to direct therapy at this point

   This is a 62 yo M with history of renal transplant and hypertension who
   is presented with one week of high fevers and lactate >7. The patient
   now returns to the ICU with evolving sepsis.  CT abd/pel showed marked
   lymphadenopathy concerning for PTLD versus lymphoma.  The source of the
   patient's elevated lactate is still unclear, differential includes
   tumor lysis v ischemia.  Infectious source could include bacteria in
   the absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use,
   disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given radiographic
   evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis/Sepsis:  Etiologies could include bacteria in the
   absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use,
   disseminated TB, strongyloides, and cholecystitis given radiographic
   evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.  Lactate could also be due to
   tumor lysis. Uric acid and potassium are elevated supporting tumor
   lysis
   - Follow up blood, urine cultures
   - CIS
   - Consider LP for further FUO work up
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] cefepime, add vanc and fluconazole
   - general surgery for excisional lymph node biopsy
   - CVL for rapid volume repletion
   - f/u EBV PCR
   - f/u CMV and HVC viral load
   - aggressive fluid, with monitoring BP / CVP
   - Heme recs
   - ID recs
   - Renal transplant recs
   - General surgery recs
   # Acidosis - Likely due to sepsis as above but could also be due to
   tumor lysis if this is, in fact, a lymphoma.  CK low so muscle not
   likley source of lactate.
   - continue fluids and support for sepsis as above
   - trend lactate
   #  Hyponatremia - Pt given large volume of free D5W today.  Urine osms
   and Na high.  Will challenge with normal saline.
   - continue NS resuscitation if Na responds to bolus, switch to 3%
   saline if Na down
   .
   # Hypoglycemia - possibley due to tumor burden v hepatic dysfunction.
   Continuing while
   - glucose gtt, D5W but consider D10
   .
   # Elevated LDH: Differential includes hemolysis, malignancy such as
   lymphoma, PTLD, PCP/histoplasmosis or other fungal infections. No
   history of malignancy, though he would be at risk for PCP in given
   immunosuppression.
   - appreciate heme-onc consult
   - will need excisional biopsy
   - uric acid and K elevated, c/w tumor lysis but phos low
   - continue fluconazole.
   # Kidney disease s/p transplant: Has history of renal transplant in
   [**Country 297**] 3 years ago. [**Month (only) 51**] be prerenal in the setting of
   hypovolemia/infection, though may be baseline. Stable over the last few
   days at [**Hospital1 **] (was up to 1.6 there, now back down to 1.3). Patient
   did bring in records of his creatinine over time in [**Country 297**], units in
   umol/dL.  Elevated urine Na may also suggest a component of intinisic
   renal dysfunction.  If this is tumor lysis, concern for urate
   nephropathy.
   - urine lytes. FeNa
   - Continue IVF resuscitation as above
   - Follow UOP  very closely
   - Continue prednisone, cyclosporin and cellcept
   - appreciate transplant nephrology rec's
   - no further dye if possible
   #  Hematemesis - coffee grounds an some bright red blood 3/21, guaiac
   positive.  Per chart, has prior history of ulcer.  NGT to suction
   without evidence of further bleeding.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor HCT
   - consider GI consult
   # HTN: Patient currently normotensive to hypotensive.
   - Given patient's unclear picture and current HD stability, will hold
   nifedipine CR for now. Can restart if becomes hypertensive

Infectious sources could include bacteria in the absence of antibiotics, fungemia given chronic steroid use, disseminated tuberculosis (TB), strongyloidiasis, and cholecystitis given radiographic evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.

The patient has multiple complications including shock, mixed acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, fever of unknown origin, chronic renal failure, and hypertension. His vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate, elevated uric acid, elevated potassium, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal therapy, and further diagnostic workup including blood, urine cultures, and excisional lymph node biopsy. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and coordination of care involving multiple specialists including infectious disease, hematology/oncology, general surgery, and renal transplant medicine."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant for IgA nephropathy. He presented with fevers for two weeks post-transplant and was initially treated with cefepime. The patient was admitted to the medical ward but developed a fever again and was subsequently admitted to the medical ICU (MICU) due to his critical condition.

Upon admission to the MICU, the patient had an elevated lactate level of 7.5, indicating possible septic shock. A CT torso showed possible mesenteric adenitis, which raised suspicion for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The patient was given intravenous fluids (IVF), and tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were ordered.

The patient's condition worsened, and he experienced upper back pain and shortness of breath. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing multiple semisolid masses on the liver. Biopsies were taken, and the patient was started on neomycin.

The patient's vital signs were unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. He required invasive ventilation and arterial lines for continuous monitoring. Additionally, a dialysis catheter was placed due to the patient's acute kidney injury.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant for IgA nephropathy, presenting with fevers and lymphadenopathy. He has been admitted multiple times with persistent fever, lactate levels indicating sepsis, and possible mesenteric adenitis on CT scan. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and liver biopsy due to worsening symptoms. He remains critically ill with severe acidosis, lactic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypoglycemia. The patient's condition is complicated by a cracked HD line, acute blood loss anemia, and negative flow cytometry results for monocellular process. Liver and lymph node biopsies are pending. The patient's underlying medical history and lymphadenopathy raise concerns for aggressive lymphoma or tumor lysis syndrome. He has been started on allopurinol and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic/lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are significantly elevated, indicating a severe metabolic acidosis. This condition can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with high levels of MV (mechanical ventilation) required. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
3. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition suggests ongoing sepsis. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed"

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   62 y/o m Mandarin speaking s/p renal tx for IgA nephropathy, fevers for
   2 weeks PTA, taken a cephalosporin as o/p for a week, admitted to MWH
   from [**Date range (1) 6453**], sent home, p/w fever here on [**4-13**], lactate 7.5,
   admitted to MICU organge. CT torso showed possible mesenteric adenitis.
   Briefly in MICU for 1 day, given IVF, sent EBV, CMV, felt may be PTLD.
   Transferred to floor on [**4-14**]. CT abd with contrast on Sat which showed
   mesenteric and RP LAD, suspicious for PTLD. Heme Onc consulted. Started
   on cefepime/vanco, fluconazole added. Over weekend began having upper
   back pain and SOB. Went to OR Sunday for ex lap, which showed studding
   of liver with semisolid masses, biopsies done. Came back with
   6.91/59/151 on 1.0. Lactate 10.3 up to 20 overnight. On neo from OR. CV
   sat 94%. Started on vasopressin, added decadron and flagyl. Started
   CVVH at 3am this am.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant for IgA nephropathy, presenting with fevers and lymphadenopathy. He underwent exploratory laparotomy and liver biopsy yesterday and has been experiencing hypotension and severe acidosis with worsening lactic acidosis. The flow cytometry results are negative for monoclonal process, and the liver and bone marrow biopsies are pending. The patient also has a cracked HD line/acute blood loss anemia, which has been replaced.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Metabolic/lactic acidosis: The patient is severely acidotic with worsening lactic acidosis, indicating a metabolic disturbance that needs to be addressed urgently.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have high MV due to acidosis and now seems to have pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support are necessary.
3. Sepsis: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition suggests ongoing sepsis. Cultures should be followed, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered based on the results.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Measures should be taken to support renal function, such as holding CSA and MMF, continuing steroids, and providing CVVH.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is experiencing hyp"

   a late PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease).  This
   disorder is CD10- and thus not a Burkitt's lymphoma however it appears
   very aggressive in nature.  The MIB fraction is pending.
   - We would recommend steroids at a dose of >1mg/kg prednisone (or
   equivilant) to treat his newly diagnosed lymphoma.
   - Stop his immunosuppression as you have done.
   - While he is on the steroids please monitor closely for tumor
   lysis with q6h K, Ph, Ca, LDH, UA, and creatinine
   - Continue to follow up final pathology on his biopsies including
   EBV.
   - At this time he is too unstable to consider chemotherapy as he is
   intubated, on pressors, on CVVH.  In addition he is CD20- so Rituxan is
   not an option.  If he improves in terms of his overall condition we
   would consider chemotherapy in the future.
   - If he has no improvement by the end of the week we would recommend
   readdressing goals of care.

   normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. No
   evidence of endocarditis (cannot be excluded). Left ventricular
   function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. The right ventricle appears mildly dilated. No
   pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with high fevers and lactate levels above 7. He has been diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma, possibly post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The patient's overall condition is unstable, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). He also has hypoglycemia, kidney disease, hematemesis, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high fevers and elevated lactate levels indicate a possible infection. Given his immunocompromised state due to renal transplant and chronic steroid use, he is at an increased risk for sepsis.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's aggressive lymphoma and elevated uric acid and potassium levels suggest the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome. This condition can lead to acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's history of chronic renal failure and current kidney dysfunction may worsen during his ICU stay, especially if he develops acute kidney injury due to sepsis or tumor lysis syndrome.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors indicate hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and cardiac function is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion.

   - Changed to [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanc/Flagyl/Fluc
   - Stopped immunosuppression (except steroids)
   - CVVH
   - HD line cracked, replaced over wire
   - transfused 2 u pRBCs
   - HemeOnc: Biopsy has shown this to be a lymphoma most
   consistent with a late PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative
   disease).  This disorder is CD10- and thus not
   a Burkitt's lymphoma however it appears very aggressive in
   nature.  The MIB fraction is pending.
   - We would recommend steroids at a dose of >1mg/kg prednisone (or
   equivilant) to treat his newly diagnosed lymphoma.
   - Stop his immunosuppression as you have done.
   - While he is on the steroids please monitor closely for tumor
   lysis with q6h K, Ph, Ca, LDH, UA, and creat.
   - Continue to follow up final pathology on his biopsies including
   EBV.
   - At this time he is too unstable to consider chemotherapy as he
   is intubated, on pressors, on CVVH.  In addition he is CD20- so
   Rituxan is not an option.  If he improves in terms of his overall
   condition we would consider chemotherapy in the future.
   - If he has no improvement by the end of the week we would
   recommend readdressing goals of care.
   - Started Ganciclovir per ID recs
   - 7.20/26/114/11, lactate 28 at 10 PM

   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. No
   evidence of endocarditis (cannot be excluded). Left ventricular
   function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and hypertension. He presented with high fevers and lactate levels greater than 7, suggesting possible evolving sepsis. CT abdomen/pelvis showed marked lymphadenopathy, which is concerning for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) versus lymphoma. The source of the elevated lactate is still unclear, with possibilities including tumor lysis, ischemia, or an infectious source. The patient has been diagnosed with lymphoma and has been started on steroids. The patient's condition remains unstable, making chemotherapy an option for the future. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), a form of renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection could be bacterial, fungal, or related to a disseminated infection such as tuberculosis or strongyloidiasis.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome: With the diagnosis of lymphoma, there is a risk of tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's history of renal transplant and current use of CVVH suggest an underlying kidney dysfunction. This could be exacerbated by tumor lysis syndrome or sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient is currently on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating potential hypotension.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low glucose levels may indicate hypoglycemia, which can be related to tumor burden or hepatic dysfunction.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyponatremia and hypokalemia, which require careful management.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of hematemesis and a positive guaiac test, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly related to an ulcer.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunctions and requires close monitoring and management of potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been diagnosed with high-grade lymphoma and are currently not a candidate for chemotherapy due to instability. The patient is being treated with ganciclovir, neo, vaso for blood pressure management, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (heart rate of 114 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure ranging from 100/66 to 135/81 mmHg). They are also experiencing respiratory distress with crackles and wheezes in their chest, and their oxygen saturation is at 95%.

Laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose level is significantly elevated.

The patient's condition is complicated by several issues including hypovolemia, septic shock, mixed acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypocalcemia, hypothermia, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Plan of Care:
1. Lactic acidosis: Continue CVVH, consult renal about not running positive if possible, continue steroids.
2. ID: Stop vancomycin, Flagyl, fluconazole, continue meropenem, ganciclovir for possible EBV, follow up O+P.
3. Respiratory: Titrate down FiO2 for goal PaO2 >60, currently acidosis is limiting, meet criteria for ARDS.
4. Hyperglycemia: On insulin gtt, continue FS q1h.
5. Coagulopathy: Hct > 25, plt >10, give plt and FFP if bleeding.
6. ARF: CVVH, off immunosuppressives except steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory distress and the need to meet criteria for ARDS suggest a potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure and the ongoing CVVH indicate a possible worsening of renal function.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The abnormal electrolyte levels, such as hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia, need to be closely monitored and managed.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to lymphoma and ongoing treatment increases the risk of infections.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation abnormalities pose a risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature needs to be addressed promptly.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels require careful monitoring and management."

   outlined above, and would add: 62 yo male s/p renal transplant for IgA
   nephropathy, visiting his son from [**Name (NI) 297**], admitted with several wks of
   fevers and abdominal LAD with rapid clinical deterioration: acute
   respiratory failure, shock, rising lactic acidosis. By BMBx and LN Bx
   has an aggressive lymphoma, CD20 negative, but too ill for systemic
   chemotherapy. Course has remained tenuous overnight with continued
   shock requiring 3 pressors to maintain MAP, acute respiratory failure
   requiring high FiO2 for acceptable oxygentation. Acid-base status
   improved from yesterday, though mostly this is reflective of more
   aggressive dialysis infusion as lactate remains high (17-22).
   Problem [**Name (NI) **]
   1. Lymphoma- too ill for systemic chemo, but have increased steroids
   and remains on allopurinol for tumor lysis, ganciclovir for ?EBV. Off
   other immunosuprressants. Rest of biopsy results still pending to
   further characterize his lymphoma
   2. Sepsis: possible that his course reflects the severity and
   aggressiveness of his lymphoma rather than a superimposed infecitous
   process, but remains on broad spectrum antibiotics pending return of
   culture results. On merepenem, vanco /flagyl dc
d. ID consult team
   following.
   3. Lactic acidosis- on CVVH and intermittently bicarb infusion.
   4. Acute respiratory failure: Reasonable oxygenation and ventilation on
   AC ventilation, but high FiO2 requirement. Can try increasing PEEP if
   improved oxygenation needed, though this may drop his blood pressure.
   5. Shock: on 3 pressors and ongoing fluid resuscitation. Starting
   vigileo to help guide management.
   6. LFT abnormalities: likely reflects shock liver but will check RUQ

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent renal transplant for IgA nephropathy. He was admitted with fevers and abdominal pain, and his condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to acute respiratory failure, shock, and rising lactic acidosis. A biopsy revealed high-grade lymphoma, but due to his instability, he is not a candidate for chemotherapy. The patient is currently on ganciclovir, neo, and vaso for blood pressure management. He is also on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and has a spike in temperature while on CVVH. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lymphoma: The patient has an aggressive lymphoma, but due to his critical condition, systemic chemotherapy is not an option. He is receiving increased steroids and ganciclovir for possible EBV infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's clinical deterioration may be due to sepsis, and he is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has high lactate levels despite ongoing CVVH and intermittent bicarbonate infusion.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient requires high FiO2 for acceptable oxygenation, indicating severe respiratory distress.
5. Shock: The patient is experiencing vasodilatory shock requiring multiple pressors for blood pressure management.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, which"
