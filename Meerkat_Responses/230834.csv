","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 23-year-old female with type 1 diabetes who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient experienced back pain overnight, which resolved with toradol. She also had nausea, vomiting, increased respiratory requirements, and throat pain that has worsened since admission.

On examination, the patient has a fever, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on 4 liters of oxygen. Physical examination reveals an erythematous and edematous oropharynx without exudates, tenderness over the larynx, clear lungs, and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, high anion gap, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and her hematocrit and platelet count are within normal range. Blood cultures and urine culture are pending. A chest X-ray shows a right middle lobe infiltrate, suggesting possible community-acquired pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain control for acute and chronic pain.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.
3. DKA: Insulin infusion is being administered to lower blood sugar levels and close the anion gap. Once the sugar levels and anion gap normalize, the patient will be switched to long-acting insulin (Lantus).
4. Pharyngitis: Strep throat swab has been sent, and an ENT consultation has been requested.
5. Right middle lobe infiltrate: Levofloxacin has been started for community-acquired pneumonia.
6. Other ongoing treatments include IV fluids, potassium supplementation, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA can lead to complications such as cerebral edema, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia.
2. Pneumonia can progress to sepsis and respiratory failure.
3. The patient's throat pain and worsening pharyngitis may indicate a possible bacterial infection, which could lead to complications if not properly treated.
4. Electrolyte imbalances due to insulin treatment and fluid resuscitation may require careful monitoring and management.
5. The patient's underlying type 1 diabetes needs to be managed long-term to prevent further episodes of DKA and complications associated with diabetes."

She has been experiencing back pain, nausea, vomiting, increased respiratory requirements, and a fever. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia and hypotension. She is receiving insulin, IV fluids, and antibiotics for suspected upper respiratory infection. The patient's labs indicate high blood glucose levels, elevated anion gap, and electrolyte imbalances. She also has low thyroid hormone levels and is being treated with Synthroid. Additionally, she is taking Abilify for depression. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple IV lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is slightly below normal, indicating impaired gas exchange and potential tissue hypoxia.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. If not promptly treated, it can lead to severe complications such as cerebral edema, renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a possible infection, which could worsen if not appropriately managed. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill obese female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of feeling like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is unable to speak due to throat pain and has difficulty swallowing. Physical examination reveals tender diffuse cervical adenopathy, swollen uvula, crackles in the right mid lung field, and no rashes. Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, high white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, but she is tachycardic. The patient has been receiving insulin and IV fluids, and her condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high glucose levels and symptoms suggest the possibility of DKA. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, insulin drip, and serial electrolyte monitoring are recommended to manage this condition.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The presence of RML infiltrate on the chest X-ray raises suspicion for pneumonia. Antibiotics such as levofloxacin have been initiated, and further evaluation by an ENT specialist is necessary.
3. Sore Throat and Difficulty Swallowing: The patient's severe throat pain and difficulty swallowing may be due to an upper airway narrowing or infection. Supplemental oxygen and an ENT evaluation are needed to determine the cause and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of feeling like she has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently on an insulin drip, IV fluids, and being monitored for various vital signs and lab parameters. The patient is obese and unable to speak due to throat pain. Her physical examination reveals tender diffuse cervical adenopathy, swollen uvula, crackles in the right mid lung field, and normal neurologic status. Lab results show elevated glucose levels, leukocytosis, slightly low potassium, and normal creatinine levels. The patient's chest X-ray indicates a right middle lobe infiltrate, which may suggest pneumonia. The assessment and plan include aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, insulin drip, serial electrolytes, and repletion as needed. The patient is also being treated for a possible sore throat and potential pneumonia, and her hypothyroidism is being managed with Synthroid. She is on home abilify for psychiatric issues but is not taking it due to throat pain. The patient's disposition is ICU pending gap closure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated glucose levels, leukocytosis, and symptoms suggest DKA. If not properly managed, it can lead to severe complications such as cerebral edema, renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of a right middle lobe infiltrate on the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old with type 1 diabetes who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) likely secondary to pneumonia and laryngitis. The patient has been diagnosed with right middle lobe infiltrate, indicating community-acquired pneumonia, and pharyngitis/laryngitis. The patient was initially treated with insulin subcutaneously but developed an anion gap of 18 overnight, so they were placed back on insulin infusion. The patient's glucose level in the emergency department was 481, and the anion gap was 35. The patient is currently on insulin drip and will have rechecked chemistry now. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed right middle lobe infiltrate, indicating community-acquired pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress, sepsis, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. DKA: The patient presented with DKA, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. If not managed properly, DKA can result in severe complications such as cerebral edema, organ failure, and even death.
3. Laryngitis/Pharyngitis: The patient has laryngitis/pharyngitis, which may cause airway compromise and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This can potentially lead to respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
4. Hypothyroid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but they have fluctuated throughout the stay. The patient has been receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has been weaned off sedation. Physical examination reveals poor peripheral pulses bilaterally. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 is consistently below the normal range, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This can be due to underlying lung pathology or respiratory support issues.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels and the presence of ketones in the blood or urine suggest a possible development of DKA, especially considering the patient's history of diabetes.
3. Acute Pain: The patient is reported to have acute pain, which requires proper pain management to prevent further complications.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient may also have chronic pain associated with underlying medical conditions.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic heparin sodium is being"

","The patient is a 23-year-old female with type 1 diabetes who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She also has a right middle lobe infiltrate, concerning for community-acquired pneumonia, and worsening pharyngitis. The patient's pain is preventing her from taking oral medications. The initial assessment includes acute pain, hypoxemia, and DKA.

The plan includes sending a strep throat swab and consulting ENT for the pharyngitis. The patient's DKA precipitants are likely pneumonia and pharyngitis. Influenza testing was negative. The patient was started on IV D5NS with 20mEq K+ at 500cc/hr until anion gap closes, insulin gtt at 4u/hr until sugars are in the 200-300 range and AG closes. Once the sugar is 200-250 and AG closes, the patient will switch to Lantus 60u with sliding scale insulin. Chem 10 will be done q4 hours, and endocrinology consult was requested.

The patient's other ongoing issues include hypothyroidism, depression, and FEN (likely referring to feeding or nutrition). The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). PPX (prophylactic antibiotics) includes heparin subcutaneously and bowel regimen. The patient has a PIV (peripheral intravenous) line and code status is full code. The patient is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and hypothyroidism who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after experiencing a sore throat and dry cough for several days. The patient's initial gap has closed, and she is being transitioned to insulin. She has laryngitis, which is suspected to be either secondary to a viral illness or pneumonia (PNA), as indicated by a right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient is unable to take oral medications reliably due to her current condition. Other assessments and plans include monitoring glucose levels, following up on strep swab, cultures, urine legionella, providing supplemental oxygen as needed, administering levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), repeating CXR due to the disconnect between the right middle lobe infiltrates and left lower lobe crackles, managing hypothyroidism with Synthroid, and monitoring psychiatric conditions with Abilify. The patient is receiving critical care in the ICU, including nutrition through continuous feeding (CLD) and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. She has multiple lines inserted for various purposes, including prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition may involve a possible callout later if her condition stabilizes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and hypothyroidism. She presented to the ICU in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after experiencing a sore throat and dry cough. The patient has been receiving insulin and is transitioning off the insulin gtt. Her electrolyte levels are replete, but she is unable to take oral medications reliably. She also has laryngitis, for which she is being evaluated for possible bacterial infection and is on levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's thyroid condition is being managed with Synthroid, and she is also on Abilify for psychiatric reasons. In the ICU, she is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), has multiple IV lines, and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. The patient's initial gap of ~40 and subsequent transition to insulin suggest that she may still be at risk for DKA complications, such as cerebral edema, acute kidney injury, and cardiac arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   23 y/o femail with h/o DM type and hypothyroidism who presented in DKA
   after several days of a sore throat and dry cough.  Initial gap ~40,
   now closed and getting transitioned to insulin [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**].
   # DKA:  Secondary to viral illness vs PNA.  Agree with aggressive IVF
   resusitation, insulin drip, serial electrolytes and replete as needed.
   - IVF w/glucose and potassium.  Unable to take POs reliably as below.
   - Replete lytes
   - Follow glucoses now that transitioned off gtt

   # Laryngitis:  Flu swab negative, but has RML infiltrate on CXR after
   getting hydrated.  S/p ENT evaluation - diffuse swelling and erythema,
   no airway compromise.
   - F/U strep swap, cultures, urine legionella
   - Supplemental O2 as needed
   - Levofloxacin for CAP
    # Hypothryoidism:  On Synthroid.

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and hypothyroidism. She presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after experiencing a sore throat and dry cough for several days. The initial gap has closed, and she is being transitioned to insulin. She also has laryngitis, which is being treated with antibiotics due to a negative flu swab and the presence of a right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. She has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently on Synthroid, as well as being on Abilify for psychiatric reasons. In the ICU, she is receiving aggressive intravenous fluids, insulin drip, and serial electrolyte monitoring. She has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge and 22-gauge line inserted on different days. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): With multiple lines in place, there is a risk of developing a CRBSI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): As"
