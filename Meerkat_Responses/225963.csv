   BP responded to fluids. CVP now is still 6. Patient remains volume
   depeleted; would give additional fluid now to get CVP to [**9-16**] given
   that he is due for ERCP and sedation. I think the CT scan represents
   pneumonia, not CHF, given the low CVP and the anterior, upper lobe,
   non-dependent distribution to his infiltrates. Do not think this is a
   bacterial pneumonia. PCP is another consideration; would do a sputum
   induction. If cultures negative at 48 hours, would stop vanco.
   Doubt patient is septic. Initial hypotension probably related to volume
   depletion, perhaps complicated by some GI bleeding. Hct is 29; not at
   threshold for transfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cancer in the pancreas, and pneumonia. The patient presented with hypotension, respiratory distress, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition improved with the administration of fluids, weaning off vasopressors, decreased oxygen requirements, and minimal abdominal discomfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has an increased risk of developing sepsis due to their compromised immune system from cancer and underlying conditions.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest CT findings suggest pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia, which may require insulin therapy for glycemic control.
4. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient's respiratory distress could be a result of an acute exacerbation of COPD, further complicating their respiratory status.
5. GI bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed increases the risk of further bleeding episodes, potentially leading to hypotension and shock.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's pancreatic cancer may progress, leading to worsening overall health and quality of life.
7. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of CABG indicates underlying coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of cardiac events such as myocardial"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic gastric outlet obstruction due to pancreatic cancer. He presented with acute respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with acute exacerbation. He also has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

The patient's symptoms include fatigue, dry mouth, no chest pain or palpitations, occasional crackles throughout the respiratory system, and no rash or jaundice. His vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/54 mmHg to 135/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, and he has received fluid resuscitation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased glucose levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium. The patient's renal function is normal.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Differential diagnosis includes infection (aspiration pneumonia, atypical), inflammatory reaction (potentially secondary to chemotherapy), edema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He also has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and pancreatic cancer. The patient presented with increased oxygen requirement and hypotension, leading to a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress. Ground glass opacities were seen on imaging, and the patient's condition improved with diuresis and nebulization. He is currently tolerating regular diet and has been taken off pressors. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's worsening chest X-ray suggests pulmonary edema, which can be a complication of sepsis or fluid overload. Treatment includes diuretics, nebulization, and titration of oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count indicate possible sepsis. Antibiotics have been started to cover atypical pneumonia and other potential infections.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Regular insulin sliding scale has been initiated to maintain glycemic control.
4. Gastric Outlet Obstruction: Although ERCP did not show any obstruction, the patient's history of chronic gastric outlet obstruction should be monitored, and cyberknife treatment may be considered.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD and recent EKG changes should be monitored closely, especially since his hematocrit (Hct) is below 30. Consideration for repeat EKG with cardiac enzyme testing may be necessary if symptoms or hemodynamic instability occur."

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and anemia. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and cancer of the pancreas. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoxemia, hyperglycemia, and potential congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles scattered bilaterally at the bases, no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction, a well-nourished appearance, and no acute distress. His vital signs are stable except for transient drops in blood pressure during sleep, with a current temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 127 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 173 to 209 mg/dL. Other lab findings include elevated creatinine and lactate levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows diffuse increase in interstitial markings on chest X-ray.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to potential complications such as worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of hypoxemia, progression of sepsis, exacerbation of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic gastric outlet obstruction and pancreatic cancer. He presented with increasing oxygen requirement and hypotension. The patient's ABG showed hypoxemia and hypercapnea, with an A-a gradient >170. Despite this, he was able to ambulate well with supplemental oxygen and maintain sats >88. The patient was started on empirical PCP treatment with Bactrim and prednisone due to suspected PCP pneumonia. However, the Heme/Onc team indicated that this may be due to Gemzar toxicity. The patient was diuresed well with lasix, with BNP decreasing from 6151 on presentation to 3288. The patient experienced acute onset of abdominal pain radiating to the back and left shoulder, sharp and colicky, without ECG changes. He received 2 mg morphine x 3, along with ativan, with minimal relief. The patient became more delirious throughout the night, getting up repeatedly and wanting to leave. He received 6 IV morphine, and ativan made him confused, so Haldol was given. The patient became tachycardic in the low 100s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement and hypoxemia suggest acute respiratory distress. Differential diagnosis includes infection (atypical pneumonia, PCP), inflammatory reaction (potentially secondary to chemotherapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic gastric outlet obstruction and pancreatic cancer. He presented with increasing oxygen requirement and hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress, hypotension, gastric outlet obstruction, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently receiving various treatments and interventions for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to infection (such as atypical pneumonia or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), an inflammatory reaction (potentially secondary to chemotherapy), or fluid accumulation in the lungs. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as titrating oxygen therapy, nebulizers, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to sepsis, inadequate fluid resuscitation, or cardiogenic shock. Intravenous fluid boluses and careful monitoring are required to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. Gastric Outlet Obstruction: Despite the absence of physical obstruction, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible gastric outlet obstruction. Further evaluation with repeat imaging studies and consideration of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or CT abdomen may be warranted to determine the cause and guide management.

4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent EKG changes raise concerns about potential"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic gastric outlet obstruction and pancreatic cancer. He is currently presenting with increased oxygen requirement and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress, which may be caused by infection, inflammatory reaction (possibly secondary to chemotherapy), or edema. The patient's condition has worsened, with new ground glass opacities observed on chest X-ray, indicating pulmonary edema. After receiving 20 IV Lasix, the patient's lungs cleared, and his oxygen saturation improved.

The patient also has hypotension, which has been managed by holding diuretics and monitoring blood pressure closely. Antibiotics have been started to cover atypical pneumonia, and nebs (nebulizers) have been used as needed.

Additionally, the patient has a history of gastric outlet obstruction, but ERCP showed no obstruction. The patient is now tolerating small amounts of regular diet without nausea, and Cyberknife treatment is being considered for Monday.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but EKG changes were not present. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is below 30, and cardiac enzymes (CEs) have been negative twice.

The patient is on metformin for diabetes mellitus (DM) and is being monitored for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He has an acute exacerbation of COPD and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient is currently in the ICU with the following conditions: hypoxemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the pancreas.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's underlying COPD and acute exacerbation put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection. This increases the risk of developing other infections in the ICU, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CABG suggests a predisposition to cardiovascular issues. In the ICU setting, there is an increased risk of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and heart failure.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's consistently elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia. Poor glycemic control in the ICU can increase the risk of infections, delayed wound healing"

 CT chest reveals diffuse GG opacities, with

   empirically given the CT findings. Induced PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   Acute/Chronic abdominal pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), pancreatic cancer, and gastric outlet obstruction. He presented with increasing oxygen requirements, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and cancer. The patient is on a dilaudid drip for pain control and ativan for symptom control. Family is present in the unit. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening respiratory status indicates a potential for further respiratory compromise. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: Despite the absence of organ dysfunction, the patient's presentation suggests sepsis due to the presence of infection risk factors. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any progression of sepsis and initiate timely interventions.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of insulin may be required to maintain glycemic control.
4. Cancer: The patient's underlying pancreatic cancer may continue to progress, leading to complications such as tumor-related pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, or metastasis. Palliative care measures"
