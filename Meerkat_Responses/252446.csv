","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%). She presents with lightheadedness, hematocrit (HCT) drop, and melena. The patient has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination reveals mild distress, cooperation, alertness, and no oropharyngeal lesions/exudates. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated lactate levels, and slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's feeling of dizziness and previous orthostatic hypotension suggest ongoing hypotension. Further fluid resuscitation may be required.
2. Anemia: The patient has received 4 units of pRBCs and is still experiencing melena, indicating ongoing blood loss and ongoing anemia management is needed.
3. Hyperlactatemia: The elevated lactate levels could be due to hypoperfusion or mesenteric ischemia. Close monitoring and trend analysis of lactate levels is essential.
4. ESRD: The patient is on dialysis three times a week and will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She presents with leukopenia (low white blood cell count), hemoglobin drop, and melena (black, tarry stools), indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, revealing diverticulosis with old blood in the colon but no source identified for the current bleeding. Her hematocrit (HCT) level has dropped from 26 to 19.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's HCT drop and recurrent melena suggest ongoing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. Further investigations such as a bleeding scan or repeat endoscopy may be necessary to identify the source of bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Infection: Elevated lactate levels may indicate possible infection, which could be secondary to bleeding or relative hypoperfusion. An infectious workup is recommended to rule out any underlying infection.
3. ESRD management: The patient's ESRD requires careful monitoring and management. Since she did not complete her scheduled dialysis session due to low hemoglobin, it is important to notify the renal team and plan for future sessions accordingly.
4. Chronic systolic heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of stable CHF with an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She presented with lightheadedness, a drop in hematocrit (HCT), and melena. The patient underwent an endoscopy which did not reveal the source of bleeding. She received 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable with no bloody stools, but ongoing melena. A tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan has been ordered, and there is consideration for capsule endoscopy as an inpatient or outpatient procedure. The patient's blood pressure has improved, but she still requires close monitoring for hypotension and potential need for fluid bolus or transfusion. Her lactate levels are trending down and she is being closely monitored for hyperlactatemia, with consideration for an infectious workup if symptoms suggest sepsis. The patient has ESRD and received HD on Saturday, with ongoing renal follow-up. She also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, which is currently stable. The patient's diabetes management is being continued with half doses of insulin while NPO, and she will be started on a diabetic diet once no longer NPO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and hypertension. She presented with lightheadedness, a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT), and melena. The patient has been receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfusions and is currently on dialysis. Her lactate levels are elevated, and she has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient is also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) and is being managed with insulin and diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of lower GIB and is currently experiencing melena, indicating ongoing bleeding. This could lead to further drops in HCT and hypotension.
2. Hypotension: The patient's feeling of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension on admission suggest possible hypotension. This could be due to blood loss from the gastrointestinal bleeding or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Hyperlactatemia: The patient's elevated lactate levels may be caused by tissue hypoperfusion or mesenteric ischemia. Close monitoring and trend analysis of lactate levels are essential.
4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment, which should be continued"

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given prior hct drops and melena recently.
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She presents with lightheadedness, a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and melena. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 143/58 mmHg and heart rate of 88 beats per minute. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. Firstly, there is a concern for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the Hct drop and melena. The etiology of the bleed is uncertain, with possibilities including small bowel bleeding or right-sided diverticulosis. 

Secondly, the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis. Her renal function should be closely monitored, and she is scheduled for hemodialysis today. 

Thirdly, the patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. Her cardiac status appears stable, but her medications need to be managed accordingly.

Lastly, the patient has diabetes mellitus, which requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels. While NPO (nothing by mouth), she will receive half the dose of her regular insulin regimen. Once she is no longer NPO, she will be placed on a diabetic diet and her oral hypoglycemic medication will be adjusted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening gastrointestinal bleeding, acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hypertension. Vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure and normal heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving pantoprazole, an infusion, and other medications. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 73 mL since 12 AM. The patient is not receiving respiratory support. Physical examination findings are not documented. Lab results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as low albumin and calcium levels. WBC count is within normal range, while Hct and Plt levels are decreasing. Other lab results are within normal range or not significantly abnormal. The patient's condition remains unchanged from admission, with a persistent gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleed is a critical concern and may require further interventions such as endoscopy or surgery to control the bleeding.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's current blood pressure is stable, there is a risk of developing hypotension due to ongoing fluid losses and potential sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level indicates possible acute kidney injury, which can occur in the setting of dehydration or sepsis.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's high potassium level requires close monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient presents with lightheadedness, hematocrit (HCT) drop, and melena. She has received 10 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently stable. A tagged red cell scan has been ordered, but the efficacy at this time is uncertain. The patient is also scheduled for capsule endoscopy on Tuesday and bowel prep on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of lower GIB and is currently experiencing melena, which indicates ongoing bleeding. There is a potential for further bleeding, and close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient is no longer feeling orthostatic, indicating possible hypotension. Fluid bolus or transfusing PRN may be considered to maintain hemodynamic stability.
3. Hyperlactatemia: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which could be due to hypoperfusion or mesenteric ischemia. Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and consideration of an infectious workup if indicated are necessary.
4. ESRD: The patient has ESRD and"

","The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being closely monitored. The vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's current temperature is within the normal range.

The lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The white blood cell count has been fluctuating, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory response or infection. The hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia, possibly due to the GI bleed. The platelet count is within normal range. Other lab results, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and glucose levels, are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 327 mL of total fluids, with 70 mL given intravenously. The output includes 400 mL of urine and 300 mL of drainage. The patient's weight has increased from 81.3 kg at admission to 86.9 kg currently.

The patient's respiratory support is not needed, with an oxygen saturation of 100% and no supplemental oxygen being delivered. The physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the GI bleed, further deterioration of renal function, and possible infections due to the fluctuating white blood cell count. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to manage these"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, unclear exact location. The patient has no new complaints and denies any rectal bleeding this morning. The patient is currently in the ICU and is awake, alert, and in no apparent distress. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 175/74 mmHg, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of recurrent lower GI bleed with an unclear source. A capsule study is planned to determine the location of the bleed. The patient's hematocrit levels will be closely monitored.
2. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has a history of ESRD. This condition can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of benign hypertension. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.

Overall, the patient's current condition appears stable, but ongoing monitoring and management of these potential complications are essential for the patient's well-being in the ICU setting."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU and has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, end-stage renal disease, and benign hypertension.
- The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, pantoprazole, and hemodialysis.
- Vital signs show a stable temperature, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure within normal limits.
- The patient's weight is currently 84 kg, with a slight increase from admission weight.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,999 mL and output of 2,300 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 301 mL.
- Respiratory support is not required, with SpO2 at 99%.
- Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, normal cardiovascular function, symmetric chest expansion, and clear breath sounds.
- Extremities show absent peripheral pulses on the right side and decreased pulses on the left side.
- Neurologic assessment is incomplete.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels.
- Assessment and plan include management of gastrointestinal bleeding, end-stage renal disease, and ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed needs to be closely monitored for any signs of re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss. Potential complications include hypotension, shock, and the need for transfusions.
2. End-stage renal disease ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and a known allergy to enalapril. The patient is currently in the ICU due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels have remained stable, and there has been no need for blood transfusion. The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has started a capsule study. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although they show sinus tachycardia. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,000 mL, including 1,950 mL orally and 50 mL intravenously. The patient's output includes 2,300 mL of urine, with a negative fluid balance of 301 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL and an elevated white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. The patient's renal function tests show an increased creatinine level of 4.3 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient's platelet count is slightly low at 133 K/uL. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. The"
