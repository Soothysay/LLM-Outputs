","The patient is a 69-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with three days of dark bloody vomit and melena. The source of bleeding appears to be upper gastrointestinal (GI), and differential diagnoses include bleeding ulcer, variceal bleed, Boerhaave's syndrome, malignancy, and ischemic bowel. Liver function tests, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) are within normal limits, suggesting no underlying liver disease. Kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) imaging showed no evidence of obstruction or free air, while a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed right-sided colitis. Lactate levels are mildly elevated. No bowel movement was noted overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/58 mmHg to 95/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient is receiving pantoprazole intravenously at a rate of 8 mg/hour for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Empiric ciprofloxacin and flagyl are being administered for possible infectious colitis. The patient is also receiving packed red blood cells (prn) for dropping hemoglobin concentration. The patient is nil per os (NPO) pending an esophagogastrodu"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with three days of dark bloody vomit and melena. He has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has received a blood transfusion, IV fluids, and medication for possible infectious colitis. He is currently on a pantoprazole drip, receiving empiric antibiotics, and being closely monitored for his vital signs and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's dark bloody vomit and melena suggest an upper GI source of bleeding. The source could be due to peptic ulcers, malignancy, or other causes. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and ongoing blood loss is crucial.
2. Ischemic colitis: The CT scan revealed right-sided colitis, which could be indicative of ischemic colitis. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent further complications.
3. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB): Although less likely in this case, the presence of melena suggests that there may be bleeding from the lower GI tract as well. This possibility should be considered and ruled out through appropriate diagnostic tests.
4. Infection: Empiric antibiotics have been started due to suspicion of infectious colitis. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
5. Renal failure: The patient has elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating possible acute kidney injury ("

 Evidence for upper source.  Concerns include PUD, gastritis,
   [**Doctor First Name 1862**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. Less likely malignancy or varices (no stigmata of
   liver disease).   Doubt ischemic bowel (in absence of significant abd
   pain).  ABD CT scan demonstrates evidence for colitis (focal), which
   may suggest IBD.  Monitor exam, low threshold for General Surgery
   consultation.  Plan EGD this AM.
   PRESYNCOPE/SYNCOPE -- attributed to hypovolemia or vagal response to
   vomitting.  Doubt primary cardiac event, ECG without acute ischemia and
   cardiac enzymes WNL.  Monitor BP, HR, rhythm.  Check cardiac echo
   (evaluate for wall motion abnormalities, valvular heart disease, clot).
   COLITIS -- suggested by abd CT scan.  Consider ischemic bowel,
   infectious etiology (pseudomembranous) including shigella.  Not likely
   to provide etiology for UGI guiac+ material.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials.  Perhaps secondary or unrelated but concurrent
   process.  [**Month (only) 8**] require colonoscopy.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Plan net resussitation with iv fliuds; blood

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various tests and treatments. 

The patient's Hct level has gradually declined overnight, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address this. 

The patient remains NPO (nothing by mouth) and is being monitored closely. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/59 to 135/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has a history of fatigue, no fever, and no weight loss. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. The patient's eyes, heart, lungs, and peripheral vascular systems are normal. The patient has right and left radial pulses present, as well as right and left dorsal pedal pulses present. 

Abdominal examination shows that the patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no distention or tenderness. 

Extremities examination reveals no edema in either lower extremity, and there is no cyanosis or clubbing. 

Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old individual with no prior medical history who presented with three days of dark bloody vomit and melena. An endoscopy revealed a tear at the GastroEsophageal junction, which is not actively bleeding. The patient has been prescribed proton pump inhibitors, advised to resume their diet, and scheduled for an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies in two weeks. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable, and they have started taking food orally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient initially presented with dark bloody vomit and melena, indicating an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding. Although the tear found during endoscopy is not actively bleeding, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or further complications.
2. Ischemic colitis: The patient has right-sided colitis involving the proximal cecum, which could be related to ischemia. This condition can lead to inflammation and potentially worsen the patient's condition if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis with a neutrophil predominance suggests a possible infection. However, no specific source has been identified yet, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Renal failure: The patient exhibits signs of acute kidney injury, as indicated by elevated BUN levels and a history of obstruction/decreased PO intake. Proper management and hydration are crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with three days of dark bloody vomit and melena. An endoscopy revealed a tear at the gastroesophageal junction, but it was not actively bleeding. The patient was given pantoprazole (Protonix) and resumed a regular diet. He also needs to follow up with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies in two weeks, and his hematocrit (Hct) is stable.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on January 12th. He is currently on pantoprazole infusion and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/57 mmHg to 115/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,757 mL with 298 mL given through total intravenous feeding (IVF), 360 mL given orally (PO), and 2,672 mL given through IV fluids. The output includes 2,760 mL of urine, 410 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage, and -112 mL of drain output. The overall balance is 997 mL.

The patient requires no respiratory support and is not on supplemental oxygen. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided.

The patient's peripheral pulses and skin were not assessed. Neurological examination findings are also not available.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.0 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 23.8%, leukocyte count (WBC) at 17.6 thousand/mm³, platelet count (Plt) at 230 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) at 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose at 122 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) at 3.1 mEq/L. Other lab values are provided in the note.

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses and interventions. The patient has melena/hematemesis likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) source, possibly related to a tear at the gastroesophageal junction. There is also right-sided colitis involving the proximal cecum, which could be due to infection or inflammation. The patient's leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance may be a stress response from bleeding or infectious colitis. A syncopal event occurred, but further evaluation is needed. The patient has acute renal failure (AR"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, pale individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, specifically hematemesis. They underwent an endoscopy which revealed a tear at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The patient has been experiencing small amounts of melena and has been started on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). They have also been taking oral medications and receiving IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly low blood pressure. They are alert, oriented, and responding appropriately to verbal stimuli. Physical examination shows no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal areas. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels and kidney function are within normal range. The plan is to continue PPI therapy, monitor hematocrit levels, repeat EGD as an outpatient, advance diet as tolerated, follow up with an abdominal examination, and initiate age-appropriate cancer screening. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Despite the initial control of the bleeding, there is a risk of rebleeding, especially if the underlying cause is not fully addressed or if the patient develops new risk factors.
2. Stricture or scarring: The tear"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear on
   EGD.  Unclear what precipitated nausea/vomiting, concern for viral
   gastroenteritis vs ischemic colitis as inciting event.  Hct has been
   stable and no evidence of active bleeding on EGD.  Have stopped
   antibiotics at GI
s recommendation.
   - Continue PPI, trend Hct
   - Needs repeat EGD as an outpatient
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - Follow abd exam
   - Appreciated GI input
   - Will need age appropriate cancer screening as an outpatient, primary
   care doctor.

","Summary:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, specifically hematemesis. The patient's history and physical examination revealed a tear at the gastroesophageal junction observed during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient also had ongoing melena and was found to have right lower extremity edema. Vital signs showed stable blood pressure and heart rate, but there were fluctuations in temperature. The patient's respiratory support included supplemental oxygen with a SpO2 of 99%. The physical examination revealed no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurologic systems.

Laboratory results showed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.6 K/uL. Other lab values were within normal limits. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% with no significant valvular disease. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal bleed, specifically a tear at the gastroesophageal junction. The cause of the bleeding is unclear, but there is concern for viral gastroenteritis or ischemic colitis. The patient's hematocrit has been stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding on EGD. Antibiotics were stopped at the recommendation of the GI specialist. The plan includes continuing pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor), trending hematocrit levels, scheduling a repeat EGD"
