","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ankle fracture who is currently experiencing severe agitation and symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/68 mmHg to 158/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient has received a total of 12mg of lorazepam (Ativan) and 20mg of diazepam (Valium) for agitation, along with 5mg of olanzapine (Zyprexa) with some benefit but still experiencing breakthrough agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to severe agitation, confusion, tremors, seizures, and in some cases, delirium tremens.
2. Hypertension, which may require further management with antihypertensive medications such as IV hydralazine.
3. Hypoxia, as indicated by the patient's oxygen saturation levels. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or thromboembolic events.
4. Complications related to the patient's ankle fracture and subsequent surgery, such as infection or non-union of the fracture.
5. Possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and orthopedic surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with severe agitation and confusion. He has a history of an ankle fracture that was surgically repaired on [9-18] after falling while intoxicated. The patient's symptoms are consistent with ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, and he has been receiving treatment with Ativan, Valium, and Zyprexa. Despite medication, the patient continues to experience breakthrough agitation. His vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's laboratory results indicate mild leukocytosis, slightly low hematocrit, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's ECG shows no significant changes from prior, with a ventricular rate of 87 bpm, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block, and no ischemic changes. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and falls, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. He also has a right lateral malleolar fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) on [9-18]. The patient is currently NPO pending mental status assessment. He is prescribed lovenox for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is presumed full code, and he is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued EtOH withdrawal symptoms: The patient is experiencing severe agitation and confusion, which may indicate ongoing withdrawal symptoms."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis. The patient has been receiving diazepam and lorazepam for sedation. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 158/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an ABG pending. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.1 K/uL, anemia with an Hct of 29.2%, thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 202, normal creatinine levels, and slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for VAP and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is still pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, should be done.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious and later diagnosed with a broken ankle. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery but experienced post-operative delirium. The patient was given various doses of lorazepam (Ativan) for agitation and ethanol withdrawal. He was also administered diazepam (Valium) and received treatment for hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106-158/59-99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for withdrawal symptoms. He has already received treatment with lorazepam for this condition.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, which needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, indicating potential sympathetic overactivity.
4. Hypoxemia: Although the patient's current oxygen saturation is within normal limits, there is a possibility of worsening respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of ETOH abuse who was found intoxicated and with a broken ankle. He underwent ORIF surgery on [**9-18**] and is currently in the ICU. The patient is experiencing ETOH withdrawal symptoms and has been given various medications such as ativan, valium, and zydis to manage his condition. His vital signs are stable with a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. He is agitated and has unequal pupils, with the right pupil appearing surgical and the left reactive. The patient has tachycardia and rales at the bases of his lungs. His labs show normal WBC count, Hct, Plt, Cr, glucose levels, but slightly low calcium and magnesium levels. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are within normal range, but there may be an underlying cause for his delirium and agitation that needs to be investigated further.
2. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal or pain.
3. Fracture: The patient has a fractured ankle and should be kept non-weight bearing to prevent further injury.
4. FEN (Feeding): The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), so he needs to be monitored for any signs of failure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was found intoxicated and with a broken ankle on the right side. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery but was hypertensive in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and required blood pressure control with hydralazine. The patient is currently experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, as indicated by his agitation and appearance of pain. He has received a total of 12mg of lorazepam (Ativan) and 20mg of diazepam (Valium) overnight, along with 5mg of zydis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to complications such as seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens if not properly managed.
2. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be due to alcohol withdrawal or post-operative delirium. If not treated appropriately, it could progress to more severe symptoms like combativeness or self-injury.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may be related to alcohol withdrawal or pain. If left untreated, it could lead to end-organ damage or other cardiovascular complications.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 98% on 2L nasal cannula, which indicates mild hypoxemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and prevent potential respiratory complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ankle fracture post-operative repair (ORIF) on [9-18] after a fall while intoxicated. He presented with severe agitation and is suspected to be experiencing alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/66 to 180/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient is currently receiving IV morphine for pain control, lorazepam (Ativan) for agitation and alcohol withdrawal, and haloperidol (Haldol) for sedation. He also has an order for enoxaparin (Lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, with decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. His blood glucose level is within normal range, but his potassium and magnesium levels are low. His liver enzymes and troponin-t levels are normal.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Agitation and confusion: The patient is being re-oriented, receiving zydis 5mg once, and may repeat if needed. EtOH withdrawal is suspected.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: Ativan 2mg IV q1h PRN CIWA > 10. The total amount will be recorded, and the standing dose will be adjusted after the initial day, reducing by 20%/day. Transition to PO valium if the patient becomes more lucid and still requires medication. Close nursing supervision and bed alarm are implemented. Social work referral is made.
3. Hypertension: IV hydralazine can be used to control BP as needed. Hypertension is also used as a marker for withdrawal.
4. Hypoxia: The plan remains unchanged. A repeat chest X-ray will be done when the patient is less agitated. Room air saturation on MICU admission was ~89-90%, unclear reason. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia in the past, and the initial CXR showed no clear infiltrate.
5. Right lateral malleolar fracture post-ORIF on [9-18]: Ortho following, NWB RLE (can be touchdown if unable to do NWB), pain control, and Lovenox ordered for today.
6. Code status: Presumed full code.
7. Other notes: FEN (nothing by mouth) pending mental status, PPX (prophylactic Lovenox), and ICU care plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with severe agitation and confusion, which is believed to be related to ethanol withdrawal. The patient had undergone surgery for an ankle fracture and was found to have a fall while intoxicated. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 122/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Lorazepam (Ativan), Morphine sulfate, and Haloperidol (Haldol). The patient's lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and glucose. However, the patient's INR and PTT are elevated.

The patient's main concerns include agitation and confusion, hypertension, hypoxia, and a lateral malleolar fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's severe agitation and confusion may be indicative of delirium, which is common in elderly patients, especially those with a history of alcohol abuse and recent surgery.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 94"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who underwent surgery for an ankle fracture and is now experiencing severe agitation, which is consistent with ethanol withdrawal. The patient has a history of falls while intoxicated and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxia. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's CXR shows early infiltrate versus atelectasis without pulmonary edema. The patient has been treated with various medications, including IV morphine for pain control, lorazepam and haloperidol for agitation, and enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's physical examination reveals absent peripheral pulses and unassessed skin, neurologic, and respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's ongoing agitation and confusion could potentially progress into delirium, which is a medical emergency and requires prompt management.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's SpO2 level of 94% indicates hypoxia. If left untreated, this can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential organ damage.
3. Infection: The presence of an early infiltrate on the CXR raises the possibility of an impending infection. Timely identification and treatment are crucial to prevent its progression.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious and later determined to be intoxicated with a broken ankle on the right side. He presented with stupor, likely due to ethanol withdrawal and pain. The patient has been treated for ethanol withdrawal with multivitamins, thiamine, and folate. He has been given valium for agitation, and antipsychotics have been used as well. Pain management has been initiated with oxycodone. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low-grade fever, and stable blood pressure. He is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with oxygen saturation at 94%. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Kidney function appears to be normal, and cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. 

Physical examination reveals decreased bases on lung auscultation, a surgical right pupil, and no edema in the extremities. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current issues include ethanol withdrawal, agitation, broken ankle, hypertension, hypoxemia, fracture, and delirium. 

The plan includes continuing antipsychotics for agitation, pain management with oxycodone, holding off on treating hypertension, investigating the etiology of delir"

The patient is now experiencing severe agitation and signs consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 99%. Physical examination reveals somnolence, normal airway, respiratory rate and effort, clear to auscultation bilaterally, soft and non-tender gastrointestinal system, and no edema in the left leg but right lower leg in cast. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio. The patient is receiving valium and oxycodone for agitation and pain, respectively. Multivitamins are being given through tube feeds, along with thiamine 100mg IV x3. Home antihypertensive medications are being held. Ortho follow-up is planned for the right lateral malleolar fracture. The patient is receiving tube feeds and lovenox for prophylaxis. Code status is presumed full. The patient is currently on probalance, a type of nutrition support, and has no lines inserted. Prophylaxis measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP precautions."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after surgery for an ankle fracture. The patient has a history of alcoholism and was found to be severely agitated, which is consistent with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The patient is currently sedated and responding to medication for pain and agitation. There are concerns about potential complications such as aspiration due to tube feeds being held overnight, hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient's agitation and sedation increase the risk of aspiration, especially since tube feeds were held overnight.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be secondary to delirium and agitation. Holding home antihypertensive medications may contribute to this.
3. DVT: Immobility due to a cast on the left leg and the absence of edema in the right leg could increase the risk of developing a DVT.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the provided information. Additional assessments and tests may be necessary to fully evaluate the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for severe agitation and suspected ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. The patient underwent ankle fracture ORIF on [**9-18**] after falling while intoxicated. He is currently experiencing ongoing agitation and confusion, which may be attributed to pain, withdrawal, or medical delirium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/64 to 159/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and responds to voice, with clear lung sounds bilaterally and a soft abdomen. He has a cast on his left leg and no edema in his right leg. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and glucose levels, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. The patient's medications include enoxaparin (Lovenox), morphine sulfate, diazepam (Valium), and other ICU medications. The patient's code status is presumed full code, and he is receiving ICU care with nutrition provided through tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found intoxicated and with a broken ankle on the right side. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle. The patient is currently in the ICU due to ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and complications related to the surgery. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/64 mmHg to 159/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's pain level is reported as minimal at 12-5 and located in the ankle. His review of systems shows agitation, no fever, no signs of abuse, and minimal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, which can include agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and in severe cases, delirium tremens. Close observation and administration of benzodiazepines like diazepam (Valium) are necessary to manage withdrawal symptoms.
2. Infection: The patient's broken ankle and surgery may increase the risk of infection. Signs of infection may include fever, redness, swelling, warmth, and drainage at the surgical site. Monitoring for these symptoms is important, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered if needed.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male who underwent ankle fracture surgery and is now experiencing severe agitation. The patient's symptoms are consistent with ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, given the timing of the symptoms after alcohol intake. The patient's confusion and agitation could be attributed to various factors including pain, withdrawal, or medical delirium.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 184/89 mmHg to 125/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's rhythm is sinus.

The patient has lost IV access and has received a total dose of 210 mg of Valium. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, potassium, and magnesium levels are within normal range. Sodium, chloride, and calcium levels are slightly elevated. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH level of 7.28.

The patient is being treated with Valium and oxycodone for agitation and pain. The patient's alcoholism is being managed with multivitamins in tube feeds and thiamine supplementation. Hypertension is suspected to be secondary to delirium and agitation, and the patient's home ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted with an ankle fracture and underwent ORIF on September 18th. He presented with severe agitation and is suspected to be experiencing alcohol withdrawal, as he has been intoxicated and now shows signs of withdrawal. The patient has been on the CIWA scale for six days and has received significant amounts of Valium. However, the patient no longer exhibits signs of withdrawal, and psychiatry suggests discontinuing Valium and adding Haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure, and he has lost both peripheral IV access overnight. The patient's labs indicate normal WBC, Hct, and Platelet counts, but slightly elevated BUN and Creatinine levels. He has been on tube feeds and is receiving multivitamins, including thiamine. The patient's pain is being managed with oxycodone. An EKG is ordered to check for QTc prolongation, and a head CT is planned to rule out any bleed. Tests for TSH and vitamin B12 are also ordered. The patient has a history of alcoholism and hypertension, and his R lateral malleolar fracture is still being managed by orthopedics."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing surgery for an ankle fracture. He has a history of alcoholism and is currently experiencing severe agitation, which is being evaluated as potential EtOH withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 117/64 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, his creatinine level is elevated at 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments.

1. Delirium: The patient's severe agitation could be due to delirium, which is a common complication in ICU patients. Delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, physical restraints, and prolonged hospital stay.
2. EtOH withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcoholism, there is a possibility of EtOH withdrawal, which can cause severe agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and seizures. Close monitoring and management with benzodiazepines are necessary.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. Proper assessment and appropriate antibiotics should be considered if an infection is suspected.
4. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ankle fracture who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) on [9-18] after falling while intoxicated. The patient is now experiencing severe agitation, which is appropriate for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. The patient has been on the CIWA scale for six days and has received significant amounts of valium. It was decided to discontinue valium and add haldol for agitation, as suggested by psychiatry. The plan is to continue with oxycodone for pain management. The patient's ekg will be checked for QTc prolongation, and vitamin B12 deficiency will be addressed by adding vitamin B12. The patient also has a history of alcoholism, and multivitamins will be included in tube feeds. Thiamine 100mg IV x3 will be administered. The patient's blood pressure is secondary to delirium and agitation, and home antihypertensive medications will be held. The patient has a right lateral malleolar fracture that was surgically repaired on [9-18], and ortho follow-up has been scheduled. The patient will remain non-weight bearing on the right lower extremity (can be touchdown if unable to bear weight), and pain control will be provided. Lovenox has been ordered for today, and the splint will stay in place until further evaluation by orthopedics. Both peripheral IVs were lost overnight,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture on 9/18 after falling while intoxicated. He is currently experiencing severe agitation, which is suspected to be related to alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been on the CIWA scale for six days and has received significant amounts of Valium. However, he is still sedated and did not receive Haldol overnight. Oxycodone will be continued for pain control. The patient is also vitamin B12 deficient and has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus Mirabilis. He has a history of alcoholism and hypertension, and his blood pressure is currently being managed with metoprolol. The patient has a right lateral malleolar fracture that underwent ORIF on 9/18, and he is at risk for complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization. He also has hypoxia with a PO2 of 59 on room air, and further evaluation is needed to rule out atelectasis or pneumonia. The patient's peripheral IV lines were lost overnight, and a PICC line placement is requested. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium and agitation due to alcohol withdrawal
2. Infection from UTI caused by Proteus Mirabilis
3. Complications related to immobilization and right lateral malleolar fracture, such as DVT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ankle fracture who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) on 9-18 after falling while intoxicated. He is now experiencing severe agitation and is suspected to be going through alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been on the CIWA scale for 6 days and has received significant amounts of valium. However, his agitation persists, and psychiatry has suggested discontinuing valium and adding haldol for agitation. The patient will continue with oxycodone for pain management. There are concerns about QTc prolongation on the EKG, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypertension, a right lateral malleolar fracture, and lost peripheral IV access overnight. The patient's code status is presumed full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of severe agitation, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and the current agitation and delirium may contribute to elevated blood pressure levels. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to end-organ damage.
3. Right Lateral Malleolar Fracture: The patient has a right lateral malleolar fracture that was surgically repaired on 9-18. Poor pain control or non-compliance with weight-bearing restrictions can lead to complications like infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ankle fracture who presented with severe agitation and is suspected to be experiencing alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been sedated and on valium, but recently, psychiatry recommended discontinuing valium and adding haldol for agitation. The patient also has a Proteus urinary tract infection, which is being treated with ceftriaxone. Other issues include hypertension, a lateral malleolar fracture with ORIF on 9/18, hypoxia with a PO2 of 59 on room air, and possible atelectasis or pneumonia at the left base. The patient's pain is being managed with oxycodone, and vitamin B12 deficiency is planned to be repleted. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism due to the risk factors of immobilization and fracture. The patient has lost both peripheral IVs overnight, so a PICC line placement is requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of severe agitation, which could progress to more serious complications such as seizures or delirium tremens if not properly managed.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a diagnosed Proteus UTI, and it needs to be treated promptly to prevent the spread of infection or the development of complications like pyelonephritis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia and chest X-ray findings suggest the possibility of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ankle fracture and surgery, presenting with severe agitation and confusion. He has been diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal and is currently being treated with Valium. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, pain control issues, and is suspected to have a Proteus urinary tract infection (UTI). Other medical problems include hypertension, a lateral malleolar fracture, hypoxia, and loss of peripheral IV access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may indicate delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as alcohol withdrawal, infections, or medication side effects. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in mental status and provide appropriate interventions.
2. Infection: The presence of a suspected Proteus UTI and the need for antibiotic treatment suggest a possible infection. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, white blood cell count, and urine output can help assess the progression of the infection. Additionally, ensuring proper hygiene and infection control measures are in place is crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management should be implemented to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation level of 99% on room air is below the normal range, indicating hypoxia. Further evaluation through a chest X-ray and consideration of supplemental oxygen"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 34**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 885**], MD
   on:[**2188-9-27**] 16:02 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found intoxicated and with a broken ankle. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle fracture on [**9-18**]. Postoperatively, he was hypertensive and started on hydralazine to control his blood pressure. The patient was also initiated on the CIWA scale with ativan for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to ethanol withdrawal and delirium, despite receiving a total of 12 mg of ativan and 20 valium, as well as 5 zydis overnight. The delirium persisted even after seven days from the last ethanol intake, leading to the suspicion of postoperative or metabolic causes. Benzodiazepines were stopped two days ago, and now the patient is receiving haloperidol on an as-needed basis. 

The patient's urine culture came back positive for Proteus, which may explain the delirium due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotics (ctx) have been started. 

Other findings from the progress note include:
- EEG done, not read yet
- UCx came back with Proteus, started ctx
- Haldol changed to prn

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tcurrent: 36.5 C (97.7 F)
- HR: 76 bpm (75 - 119 bpm)
- BP: 151/54 mmHg (74/46 - 172/114 mmHg)
- RR: 14 breaths per minute (12 - 29 breaths per minute)
- SpO2: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,001 mL and total output of 1,205 mL, with an overall balance of 2,796 mL. The patient is receiving oxygen through a face tent and has a positive ABG result of ///30/. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and somnolent. His eyes show a surgical pupil with cataract, and his cardiovascular system is normal. He has crackles bibasilar on lung auscultation, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. The patient has swelling in the right lower extremity (RUE) and warm skin without rash. Neurologically, he responds to verbal stimuli, moves purposefully, and has normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 273 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 156 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium level"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a broken ankle and signs of intoxication. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle but developed hypertension and was found to be delirious in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient was started on a benzodiazepine taper and received additional medications such as haloperidol for agitation. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for ethanol withdrawal and continued to show signs of delirium despite treatment. The delirium was initially attributed to post-operative delirium or a metabolic cause. However, further investigations revealed a urinary tract infection (UTI), which was treated with ceftriaxone. The patient's urine culture came back positive for Proteus, and he was started on appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's ABG results show a low PaO2, indicating hypoxemia. This could be due to various factors such as respiratory infection, pneumonia, or atelectasis. It is important to consider the possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE) given the risk factors associated with orthopedic surgery. A CT angiography (CTA) can help rule out a PE, and a right lower extremity ultrasound (RUE U/S) can be performed to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

2. UTI: The patient's urine culture showed the presence of Proteus, confirming the diagnosis of UTI. Since the patient has already received 7 days of ceftriaxone, it is essential to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the sensitivity results.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's immobilized state and decreased mobility increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Frequent turning and appropriate skin care are necessary to prevent further skin breakdown.

4. Pain Control: The patient requires both acute and chronic pain management. Oxycodone has been prescribed, but further evaluation and consultation with the orthopedic team are necessary to optimize pain control.

5. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. The benzodiazepine taper has been completed, and alternative medications such as haloperidol may be used for agitation.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires a multidisciplinary approach to address the various potential complications and provide appropriate care."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented to the ICU with severe agitation and confusion after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for an ankle fracture. The patient's symptoms are consistent with alcohol withdrawal, and he has a history of alcoholism. He has been experiencing ongoing agitation, and it is difficult to determine whether it is due to pain, withdrawal, or medical delirium caused by an infection. The patient's blood culture has grown gram-positive cocci from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. The patient has also been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus and is being treated with ceftriaxone. Additionally, the patient has hypertension, a right lateral malleolar fracture that underwent ORIF, and hypoxia with a PO2 of 59 on room air. There are concerns about possible pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, and a CT angiogram is planned for evaluation. The patient's PICC line needs to be removed due to the presence of gram-positive cocci in the blood culture, and peripheral cultures are being sent. The patient is currently receiving tube feeds and low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). The patient's code status is presumed to be full code."

   82 y/oM a/w ankle fracture s/p ORIF on [**9-18**] after fall while
   intoxicated now with severe agitation and timing that is appropriate
   for EtOH withdrawal. Ongoing agitation.
   #Agitation and Confusion: Pain vs. withdrawal vs. medical delirium. Had
   been on CIWA scale for 6 days and received significant amounts of
   valium. . Contact[**Name (NI) **] psychiatry [**9-24**] for help in management, they
   suggested discontinuing valium, and adding haldol for agitation. Will
   go back to valium if patient exhibits further signs of withdrawal such
   as tremulousness or diaphoresis. Patient still sedated [**9-25**] and did
   not receive haldol overnight. Will continue with oxycodone for pain
   control. Vitamin B12 deficient, will replete. Urine culture from [**9-23**]
   also growing proteus.
   -discontinue standing haldol, continue with haldol prn.
   -continue standing oxycodone at lower dose for pain
   -check ekg for QTc prolongation
   -Vitamin B12 deficient. Will add vitamin B12
   -ceftriaxone for proteus UTI.

   Went for ORIF on [**9-18**].  In PACU was hypertensive, BP controlled with
   hydral and started on CIWA scale with ativan.   Seen by med consult on
   [**9-19**].  received total of 12mg of ativan and 20 valium and 5 zydis
   overnight.    Came to MICU for EtOH withdrawal and was received
   frequent valium but remained delerius even after 7d from last Etoh.  So

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down in a bathroom and brought to the ICU. He underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of his right ankle but experienced hypertension in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and was started on hydralazine and lorazepam. The patient was also initiated on a benzodiazepine tapering schedule for alcohol withdrawal. He was transferred to the MICU for ethanol withdrawal and continued to receive frequent valium but remained delirious even after 7 days from his last ethanol intake. The delirium may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), and he was started on ceftriaxone. An ultrasound showed no clots but could not visualize the basilic vein, and the patient's lopressor was increased. His blood cultures were positive for Proteus, so vancomycin was started. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/55 mmHg to 188/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His general appearance is well-nourished with no acute distress but somnolent. Physical examination reveals a surgical pupil, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of ETOH abuse who was found down in the bathroom, stuporous. He had a broken ankle on the right side and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) on 9/18. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), he was hypertensive and started on hydralazine and the CIWA scale with ativan. He was seen by medical consult on 9/19 and received a total of 12 mg of ativan and 20 valium and 5 zydis overnight. He came to the MICU for ethanol withdrawal and was received frequently with valium but remained delirious even after 7 days from the last ethanol. Therefore, it was felt there may be a contribution from post-op/ICU delirium or metabolic cause. Benzodiazepines were stopped two days ago, and now he is getting PRN Haldol. He still appears agitated but not alert. Today, his urine culture came back positive for Proteus, so delirium may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). He has been started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin. 

24-hour events include an ultrasound showing no clots but an absent basilic vein. His lopressor was increased, and he received B-complex and vancomycin. He has no known drug allergies. The"

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, who was admitted for an ankle fracture after falling while intoxicated. He underwent surgery (ORIF) on 9/18. Currently, the patient is experiencing severe agitation and timing consistent with alcohol withdrawal. He is unresponsive, has coarse bilateral breath sounds, and shows no orientation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 167/75 to 214/94 mmHg, heart rate between 90-119 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has been receiving various medications including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, hydralazine, haloperidol, and morphine sulfate. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal. Imaging shows no significant changes in the chest X-ray, but there is evidence of interstitial markings in the lower lung fields. Microbiology tests are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include repleting low Vitamin B12, discontinuing standing haldol, continuing haldol as needed, checking EKG for QTc prolongation, resending blood and urine cultures, and awaiting EEG results.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of concern for aspiration with secretions resembling tube feeds suctioned, and tube feeds held. The patient continues to be unresponsive, more agitated, and hypertensive/tachycardic. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are documented. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission except for dry mouth. Review of systems is also unchanged.

Flowsheet data as of 9/29/2188 07:41 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (63-119), blood pressure ranging from 167/75 to 97/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (14-26), and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent with ABG results of ///34/. The patient appears diaphoretic and has coarse bilateral crackles in the respiratory/chest examination. Neurologic examination reveals the patient to be unresponsive and not oriented.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 329 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, glucose of 117 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium of 34 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, magnesium of 27 mg/dL, calcium of 141 mEq/L, and phosphorus of 25.8%. Imaging includes a chest X-ray from yesterday showing no significant interval change with continued interstitial markings visualized at the lower lung fields. No new focal consolidations or evidence for interval aspiration pneumonia is seen. Microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is receiving ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and has multiple lines including a PICC line and NGT. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are also noted. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is not mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the concern for aspiration with secretions resembling tube feeds suctioned, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Nosocomial infections: With the presence of multiple lines and tubes, there is an increased risk of nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors may predispose the patient to DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and use of certain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers.
6. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, indicating the need for close monitoring and potential correction.
8. Renal insufficiency: The elevated creatinine level suggests a possibility of renal insufficiency, which may require further evaluation and management.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information or further evaluation may be necessary for a complete assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with severe agitation and confusion after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. The patient's symptoms are likely due to ethanol withdrawal, pain, or medical delirium caused by an infection. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for a Proteus urinary tract infection (UTI) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. He has a history of alcoholism and hypertension, and his vital signs are stable except for hypertension and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's unresponsiveness and agitation increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient's confusion and agitation may be due to delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or withdrawal symptoms.
3. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for a UTI and GPC bacteremia, indicating a risk of infection. Proper management of these infections is crucial.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to hypoventilation caused by sedation or atelectasis. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to improve oxygenation.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility, especially with the use of lovenox prophylaxis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient has undergone various interventions, including the placement of a CVL into the right internal jugular vein and the removal of a PICC line. A culture data indicates the presence of staphylococcus aureus on September 27th. The patient has been started on tramadol for pain management.

The patient has allergies to no known medications. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ceftriaxone on September 28th and vancomycin on September 30th. The patient is currently receiving infusions of haloperidol (Haldol) and other medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: The patient does not have any fever, but there is an old right corneal opacification noted. The cardiovascular examination reveals a systolic murmur. Peripheral pulses on both hands and feet are not assessed. Respiratory examination shows rhonchorous breath sounds. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. Skin examination is not performed. Neurologic examination reveals unresponsiveness, non-purposeful movement, and no withdrawal to pain.

Flowsheet data as of September 30th, 8:10 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other parameters. The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 Fahrenheit), while the current temperature is 37.1 degrees Celsius (98.8 Fahrenheit). The heart rate ranges from 62 to 89 beats per minute, blood pressure varies between 109/41 mmHg and 171/73 mmHg, respiratory rate is within 11-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is consistently at 100%.

The patient's height is 66 inches, with total intake and output measurements recorded. Blood products and urine output are also documented. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 100%. ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings include right corneal opacification, a systolic murmur, and soft and non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination is incomplete.

Lab results show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Blood cultures are pending, while urine culture results from September 27th indicate the presence of staphylococcus aureus. Other lab parameters, including kidney function tests and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include delirium/confusion, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypoxemia, hypertension, alcohol abuse, constipation, fracture, impaired skin integrity, pain control, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient is receiving appropriate treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, medications for delirium, and management of other medical issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who underwent ankle surgery and has been experiencing altered sensorium since the surgery. The patient is suspected to have ethanol withdrawal and is currently in a residual coma. The patient has been on a significant benzodiazepine load.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered sensorium and there is an ongoing assessment with an EEG to confirm the diagnosis. Minimizing medications and treating infectious causes are part of the plan to manage this condition.

2. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, DTS, Seizures): The patient has been benzodiazepine loaded but still remains in a coma. This indicates that the patient may be experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and close monitoring is necessary.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has been found to have bacteremia, which has been speculated to be a contaminant due to a new PICC line. Vancomycin has been discontinued as part of the treatment plan.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection with ceftriaxone since day 5.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient is likely experiencing hypoventilation, which may be contributing to the hypoxemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

6. Hypertension: The patient has benign hypertension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with an ankle fracture and a history of alcohol abuse. He is currently experiencing delirium and has been diagnosed with EtOH withdrawal. The patient has been on a benzodiazepine tapering schedule to manage withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, the patient has been found to have bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, for which he was started on vancomycin but later stopped due to resolution of the infection. He also has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus, which is being treated with ceftriaxone. Other medical conditions include hypoxemia, alcohol abuse, constipation, hypertension, and a previous fracture that required open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right distal fibular fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's persistent coma state is likely due to alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine tapering. It is important to closely monitor his mental status and continue with the benzodiazepine tapering regimen. A neurology consult may be necessary if there is no improvement.

2. Bacteremia: The patient initially had bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Although the infection has resolved, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrent infections.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with an ankle fracture and delirium. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and is currently experiencing EtOH withdrawal with persistent coma state. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 171/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 125-147 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including ALT and AST. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range at 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including alcohol abuse, hypertension, and a right distal fibular fracture. The patient underwent ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of the fracture without evidence of hardware complication.

Microbiology cultures have shown growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus in blood cultures taken on 9/27, which led to the start of vancomycin on 9/28. However, vancomycin was stopped on 9/30 due to resolution of the infection. Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus, for which ceftriaxone was started on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with delirium, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypoxemia, hypertension, alcohol abuse, constipation, and a history of fracture. The patient has been receiving various medications including hydralazine and ceftriaxone. Vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, but the patient has intermittent responses to noxious stimuli and persistent atelectasis. The patient's fluid balance is relatively stable with a net fluid intake of 3,796 mL and output of 2,210 mL. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for slightly low potassium levels. The assessment and plan include continuing to monitor for delirium, stopping vancomycin due to likely contamination, continuing ceftriaxone for UTI, addressing hypoxemia, managing hypertension, and providing supplementation for alcohol abuse. Other concerns include constipation and a previous fracture."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with an ankle fracture and a history of ethanol abuse. He presented with persistent coma and signs of ethanol withdrawal. The patient was given flumazenil, which improved his level of consciousness. He also received lactulose for delirium/confusion/sedation. The patient had several medical issues, including bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, urinary tract infection with Proteus species, and hypoxemia possibly due to atelectasis. The patient's alcohol abuse was noted, and vitamins were continued. Other conditions included hypertension, constipation, and a fracture that required orthopedic follow-up. Metabolic alkalosis was observed, likely due to overdiuresis, and lasix was held. The patient's nutritional status was repleted with fiber, and glycemic control was maintained. Prophylactic measures included subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis and lansoprazole for stress ulcers. The patient's code status remained full code, and his disposition was pending further evaluation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with an ankle fracture, EtOH abuse, and persistent coma state. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/49 to 143/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is sedated and shows minimal response to verbal stimuli. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and mildly elevated creatinine level. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has received antibiotics for suspected bacteremia and urinary tract infection, and his fever curve is being monitored. There are no significant changes in the patient's medical and family history, review of systems, or allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications including lansoprazole, flumazenil, and ceftriaxone. The patient's recent imaging shows no abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium/Confusion/Sedation: The patient responded to flumazenil, suggesting a possible benzodiazepine intoxication. Continuous monitoring for changes in mental status is necessary to prevent or manage delirium"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious and later diagnosed with delirium/confusion likely due to toxic-metabolic causes. He underwent surgery for a broken ankle and subsequently developed withdrawal symptoms treated with high doses of benzodiazepines. The patient's mental status has slowly improved, and he responded positively to a flumazenil challenge. His current condition includes delirium/confusion, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), contraction alkalosis, hypoxemia, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, lactulose, metoprolol, and supplementation for nutritional deficiencies. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's current mental status suggests ongoing delirium/confusion. It is crucial to continue monitoring his condition and adjusting treatments as necessary to ensure proper clearance of benzodiazepines and prevent further complications.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing bacteremia, likely due to MRSE in his blood. It is essential to complete the course of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) as prescribed and closely monitor his response to treatment.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, which should be treated appropriately to prevent any further complications. Continuing the current antibiotic regimen and ensuring adequate hydration may help resolve the infection.
4. Contraction Alkalosis:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious in a bathroom on September 17th. He was intoxicated at the time and had a broken ankle on his right side. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery on September 18th and subsequently experienced withdrawal symptoms treated with high doses of benzodiazepines. His mental status has been slow to clear, but there was improvement on October 1st with a flumazenil challenge.

The patient's current condition includes delirium/confusion likely due to toxic-metabolic causes with slow hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines. Lactulose has been started to enhance clearance, and the patient is being monitored closely, avoiding all psychoactive and opioid medications. Other conditions include bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypoxemia, alcohol abuse, and a fracture with ORIF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's slow hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines may contribute to the continued mental status changes. Monitoring electrolyte imbalances and avoiding psychoactive and opioid medications is important to prevent worsening of delirium/confusion.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has been treated for MRSE (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) in the blood. Continued monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent further complications associated"

   Total time spent:  25 minutes
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse. He was found intoxicated and with a broken ankle on the right side. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle and subsequently experienced withdrawal symptoms, which were treated with high doses of benzodiazepines. The patient's mental status has been slow to clear, but there was improvement with a flumazenil challenge. The assessment indicates delirium/confusion likely due to toxic-metabolic causes, with slow hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines. Lactulose has been started to enhance clearance, and the patient's sodium and other electrolytes will be closely monitored. The patient also has a history of bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), contraction alkalosis, hypoxemia, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He had surgery for a fracture and is currently receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status has been slow to clear, and there is a need to monitor for further complications related to delirium and confusion.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in the blood. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection or sepsis.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UT"

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious in the bathroom on [9-17]. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a broken ankle on [9-18] and subsequently experienced withdrawal treated with high doses of benzodiazepines (last dose on 10/22). His mental status has been slow to clear, but there was improvement with a flumazenil challenge. The patient is currently being treated for delirium/toxic-metabolic in etiology, possibly due to slow hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines. Lactulose is being started to enhance clearance, titrated to seven bowel movements per day. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.44/52, indicating no hypercarbia contributing to the delirium.

The patient is also being monitored closely for electrolyte imbalances, particularly sodium, and is receiving B12 supplementation. He has been diagnosed with bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and contraction alkalosis. Treatment for MRSE in the blood and ceftriaxone for the UTI is ongoing.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with an ankle fracture and a history of EtOH abuse. He presented with persistent coma, delirium, confusion, and sedation. The patient responded to flumazenil, indicating likely benzodiazepine intoxication. Lactulose was started, and the patient gradually showed improvement in his mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient had a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which was initially treated with vancomycin but later stopped. This could indicate a potential infection in the bloodstream.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient was found to have Proteus in the urine and started on ceftriaxone. This suggests a UTI, which needs to be managed appropriately.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient had low oxygen saturation levels, possibly due to atelectasis. Incentive spirometry was recommended to prevent further respiratory complications.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, and it is important to continue monitoring and providing appropriate care for this issue.
5. Constipation: The patient experienced constipation and had a large bowel movement on 10/1. FOS was given to address this issue.
6. Hypertension: The patient had elevated blood pressure readings, and metoprolol was started to control it.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious and intoxicated on September 17th. He sustained a broken ankle on his right side and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery on September 18th. Post-operatively, he experienced withdrawal symptoms treated with high doses of benzodiazepines, with the last dose given on October 22nd. The patient's mental status has been slow to clear, but there has been some improvement since October 1st with the use of flumazenil. He continues to show slow improvement in mental status over the last 48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's slow hepatic clearance may be contributing to his toxic-metabolic delirium, especially considering his improvement with flumazenil, indicating benzodiazepine-induced delirium. Lactulose has been started to enhance clearance and titrate to severe bowel movements per day.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had a MRSE infection in his blood, which was treated with the removal of the PICC line and antibiotics.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is still being treated for a UTI with ceftriaxone, starting on September 26th and continuing through October 6th.
4. Contraction Alkalosis: The patient's contraction alkalosis is being managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse. He was found unconscious in the bathroom and later diagnosed as intoxicated with a broken ankle on the right side. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle on [9-18] and subsequently experienced withdrawal symptoms treated with high doses of benzodiazepines (last dose on 10/22). The patient's mental status has been slow to clear, but there was improvement observed after a flumazenil challenge. The patient continues to show slow improvement in mental status over the last 48 hours. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is likely experiencing toxic-metabolic delirium due to the slow hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines. This is supported by the improvement observed after flumazenil challenge. Lactulose has been started to enhance clearance and improve bowel movements.

2. Bacteremia: The patient had a previous infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) in the blood. Treatment for bacteremia includes the removal of the PICC line and administration of appropriate antibiotics.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a persistent UTI despite ongoing ceftriaxone treatment started on [9-26]. The course of antibiotics needs to be continued until [10-6].

He was found unconscious in a bathroom and later diagnosed with a broken ankle on the right side. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery on September 18th. After the surgery, he experienced withdrawal symptoms, which were treated with high doses of benzodiazepines. The patient showed slow improvement in mental status, particularly after a flumazenil challenge.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is likely experiencing toxic-metabolic delirium due to slow hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines. Lactulose has been started to enhance clearance and monitor bowel movements. The patient should be closely monitored, avoiding all psychoactive and opioid medications. Sodium and other electrolytes should be followed closely, and B12 levels should be replenished.

2. Bacteremia: The patient had a previous infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) in the blood. Treatment involved PICC line removal and appropriate antibiotics.
