   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum and urine cultures pending.
   Patient was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen
   shows distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with
   some mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   overnight requiring bear hugger.
   -monitor WBC and diff
   Respiratory Failure: Patient on AC 500/8/60%.  PCO2 on ventilator is
   33.  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely prerenal in etiology
   secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, presenting from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, EKG changes, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/50 mmHg to 76/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, and compliance of 45.5 cmH2O/mL.

The patient has distended abdomen with distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction, but the patient has not passed gas/stool since admission. This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and less likely an infectious source.

The patient received large volumes of intravenous normal saline (NS) and lactated Ringer's (LR) for hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Blood pressures in the 90s systolic on arrival to the
   intensive care unit.  Patient febrile, tachycardiac with a bandemia and
   a lactic acidosis.  Likely etiology is right sided pneumonia.  Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation to the emergency
   room but CT abdomen preliminarily is negative. She has now received
   over 5 liters normal saline with improvement in her blood pressure.
   She now has a central line in place.
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from emergency room
   - currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   - sputum culture if possible
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate to ensure improvement (now down to 5.1)
   - vasopressors as necessary to maintain blood pressure
   - hematocrit is elevated so no indication for transfusion
   Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation.  PCO2 on ventilator is 40.
   Will wean oxygen as tolerated. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   - continue ventilation at current settins
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - repeat cardiac enzymes in AM
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF as above, monitor electrolytes, NGT in place so will start
   tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. She is currently in the ICU for septic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, EKG changes, hypertension, dementia, and prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia and is on multiple antibiotics. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection due to the prolonged use of antibiotics.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 0.6, and it has increased to 2.0. This indicates a possible acute kidney injury, which may be prerenal in etiology due to volume depletion and septic shock. Monitoring urine output and trending creatinine levels are important to assess kidney function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung injury due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has EKG changes with ST depressions in the setting of sinus tachycardia. This could indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. Rechecking EKG and repeating cardiac enzymes would be necessary to monitor for cardiac complications.
5. Pressure Ulcers: Due to immobility"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient required invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, multi-lumen catheter insertion, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.4°F, and they are receiving continuous infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 77-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/50-76/37 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 6.4 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) between 72-73%. The patient has received a total of 13,550 mL of fluids since admission, with an output of 1,255 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of endotracheal tube ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, plateau pressure of 19 cm"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum and urine cultures pending.
   Patient was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen
   shows distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with
   some mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   overnight requiring bear hugger.
   -monitor WBC and diff
   Respiratory Failure: Patient on AC 500/8/60%.  PCO2 on ventilator is
   33.  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely prerenal in etiology
   secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

   MICU Attending Coverage Addendum
   I have reviewed the pertinent history and labs and have examined the
   patient. I was physically present with the MICU team for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I agree with the note above,
   including the assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the
   following:
   Overnight the patient was resuscitate with fluids for a low CVP and
   with this her BP is better and extremities now warm and Levophed being
   titrated down.  Lactate also trending down and U.O, somewhat better.
   On exam: Tm=101.4, P=71, BP=112/50, CVP=14, Po2=99 on 60% fi02  Sedated

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She was admitted from a rehabilitation center with pneumonia and septic physiology. She presented with a distended abdomen on admission, and a CT scan showed distended bladder, bilateral hydrouterers, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction, but the patient has not passed gas/stool since admission, which is likely due to ileus secondary to acute illness. The patient received large volumes of IV fluids for hypotension and is currently on invasive ventilation with AC 500/8/60%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure of 112/50 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 60% FiO2. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with 28% bands, elevated creatinine from baseline of 0.6, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including septic shock with possible sources from pneumonia, bladder, or abdominal infection, right lower lobe pneumonia, renal insufficiency, EKG changes indicative of demand ischemia, and prior do not resuscitate (DNR) status. The plan includes weaning FiO2 and levophed, following up with sputum and urine cultures"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place with coffee ground emesis

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA (cerebrovascular accident), and hypertension. She presents from rehab with pneumonia and sepsis caused by gram-negative rods in the non-speciated [**Year (4 digits) **] cultured - At [**2192-8-18**] 09:46 AM.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic physiology indicates a severe infection that has led to hypotension. She required large volumes of IV NS (normal saline) and LR (lactated Ringer's) for hypotension. Due to rising potassium levels, she was switched to D5 1/2NS with bicarbonate.

2. Respiratory Failure: Initially, the patient's respiratory failure was thought to be due to pneumonia. She was placed on CPAP/PSV with a set Vt (tidal volume) of 420 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR (respiratory rate) set at 24, PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 40%. However, she has not passed gas or stool since admission, which is likely due to ileus secondary to acute illness rather than an infectious source.

3. Hematocrit"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+
   oropharyngeal flora and urine cultures pending. Patient was noted to
   have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows distended
   bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some mild bowel
   thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but patient has not
   passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is chronic diarrhea).
   This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and less likely an
   infectious source. For hypotension the patient received large volume of
   IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed as tolerated
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA (cerebrovascular accident), and hypertension. She presents from rehab with pneumonia and sepsis caused by gram-negative rods. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and widespread organ dysfunction caused by an infection. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, urosepsis, and a gastrointestinal source. Cultures have grown gram-negative rods, but the speciation is pending. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and sputum and urine cultures are pending. The patient has a distended abdomen, and a CT scan shows a distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel thickening. This suggests ileus secondary to acute illness rather than an infectious source. The patient has not passed gas or stool since admission.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia. The FiO2 will be weaned as tolerated, and cultures will be followed up, with continued antibiotic therapy.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level from a baseline of 0.6, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely prerenal in etiology due to volume depletion and septic shock"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place with coffee ground emesis

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   blood. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    #) Hematocrit drop
   -          Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool
   studies as patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   -          Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   -          Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She presents from rehab with pneumonia and sepsis caused by gram-negative rods, specifically E. coli. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressors for hypotension.

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Blood cultures growing E. coli.
2. Attempted weaning off pressors unsuccessful due to low blood pressures.
3. Levofloxacin was started on 08/19/19 at 05:00 AM.
4. The patient has been experiencing ileus, with a distended abdomen, no passage of gas or stool since admission, but no indication of obstruction.
5. CT abdomen shows distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel thickening.
6. The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to intubation.
7. The patient has an elevated lactate level, which has improved from 3.4 to 2.6.
8. The patient has a hematocrit drop and guaiac-positive status, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Iron studies are ordered for the next day.
10. The patient's EKG shows ST depressions in the setting of sinus tachycardia, likely due to demand ischemia caused by hypotension. The tachycardia is now under control."

   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed as tolerated
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, pale conjunctiva, rales and crackles in the right lower lung field, and distended abdomen with soft bowel sounds. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 104 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 2.6 mmol/L, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.0 from a baseline of 0.6.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia or urosepsis, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods, but the species has not been specified yet. Cultures for sputum and urine are pending. The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   blood. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop
   -          will check crit this afternoon
   -          guiac stools (if has any), send anemia studies
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- An 82-year-old female patient with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension presents from rehab with pneumonia and sepsis caused by gram-negative rods (likely E. coli) in the blood and urine.
- The patient was initially intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but the mode of ventilation was not specified.
- She has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamicin, and levofloxacin.
- The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring the use of pressors intermittently.
- She has a distended abdomen, and a CT scan shows distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel thickening.
- There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, but the patient has not passed gas or stool since admission.
- The patient's lactate level has improved from 3.4 to 2.6, indicating better tissue perfusion.
- She has anemia with a hematocrit drop from 28.2% to 25.6%.
- The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.0 to 1.7 mg/dL, suggesting improvement in renal function.
- EKG changes show ST depressions in the setting of sinus tachycardia, which could be indicative of demand ischemia.
- The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin Day [**2-11**]
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient may not have gag reflex at baseline
   - ABG now and change vent settings accordingly
   - Suction PRN
   -Reposition patient
   -off sedation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - [**Month (only) 60**] restart lisinopril today
   -Increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since [**Hospital1 **] is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.2.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
    FEN:
   - residuals improve, so if not extubated may re-start feeding
   - will continue IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient received fluid resuscitation and is currently on antibiotics for E. coli in her urine and sputum. She is also hypertensive and requires pressure support for respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Other medical complications include anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), EKG changes, dementia, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially had SIRS and now presents with E. coli in her urine and sputum. The presence of bibasilar consolidations on CXR indicates pneumonia, which, along with the positive cultures, suggests septic physiology. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and response to antibiotics is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires pressure support due to respiratory failure likely caused by pneumonia. ABG analysis and adjustment of vent settings are necessary. Suctioning of secretions and repositioning should be done as needed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, especially in the setting of agitation. Anti-hypertensive medications may need to be adjusted or restarted when appropriate.
4. Anemia: The hematocrit drop is likely due to chronic disease or infection. Iron profile suggests chronic disease or infection. Further evaluation for GI bleeding is required, but it is"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presents from a rehabilitation center with pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), and other complications. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and ileus. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and supportive care measures. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to pneumonia. She is still on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern about extubation due to her mental status.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level on admission, indicating possible ARF. This could be due to volume depletion and septic shock, possibly leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a positive guaiac test, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding, and coffee ground emesis from the nasogastric tube. This could lead to anemia and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has ST depressions on the EKG and sinus tachycardia, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin Day [**2-11**]
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient may not have gag reflex at baseline
   - ABG now and change vent settings accordingly
   - Suction PRN
   -Reposition patient
   -off sedation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - [**Month (only) 60**] restart lisinopril today
   -Increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since [**Hospital1 **] is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.2.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
    FEN:
   - residuals improve, so if not extubated may re-start feeding
   - will continue IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension.
- She presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
- Septic shock was initially present, but now the patient's lactate level has trended down.
- She has bibasilar consolidations on chest X-ray and mild enteritis.
- The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics for suspected E. coli infection.
- Her respiratory failure is due to pneumonia, and she requires pressure support on CPAP with 40% O2.
- She has a non-responsive mental status and a dense right-sided paralysis.
- The patient has hypertension, which is currently being managed with medication.
- She also has anemia, renal failure (creatinine 2.0 on admission, improved to 1.2 today), and possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient has EKG changes consistent with demand ischemia, and an echocardiogram has been ordered.
- She has dementia and is currently intubated, making mental status assessment difficult.
- The patient is being fed through a nasogastric tube, and her electrolytes are being monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with admission with pneumonia and sepsis complicated by
   acute respiratory failure.  She now has difficulty with wean of
   ventilator support largely driven by the increase in secretions this
   morning.  In addition the marked changes in hemodynamics at the time of
   decrease in sedation may be related to anxiety/background HTN but more
   likely and more important would be evidence that patient is not ready
   to accept extubation successfully.
   Sepsis
She has multiple organisms identified and it may well be primary
   pulmonary insult with sepsis as result and aspiration pneumonia is
   perhaps most likely.
   -Levo/Vanco/Aztreonam/Gent
   -Aztreonam-For coverage of aspiration related organisms
   -Gent-For expanded gram negative converage
   Acute Respiratory Failure
Hypoxemic respiratory failure.  She has
   improved hemodynamics at this time.  She, however, has continued
   significant secretions and limited mental status to allow safe attempt
   at extubation
   -Continue with pneumonia Rx
   -PSV at 15/5
   -Will continue with PEEP increase if hypoxemia continuting.
   Hypertension-
   -Hydralazine and will up titrate B-blocker as stability of hemodynamics
   around extubation is essential.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are sepsis and acute respiratory failure. The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and sepsis, now experiencing difficulty with weaning off ventilator support due to increased pulmonary secretions. 

The patient has multiple organisms identified, and it is likely that the primary pulmonary insult led to sepsis. Aspiration pneumonia is a possible cause. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, including Levo, Vanco, Aztreonam, and Gentamicin, for coverage of aspiration-related organisms and expanded gram-negative coverage.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her hemodynamics have improved, but she continues to have significant secretions and limited mental status, which makes it unsafe to attempt extubation at this time.

Other medical conditions mentioned in the note include hypertension, for which she is being treated with hydralazine and will be up-titrated with a beta-blocker as her hemodynamics stabilize around extubation. She also has dementia, which is near baseline status per her family.

Regarding ICU care, nutrition will resume with tube feeds, glycemic control will be maintained with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP prevention will continue.

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU, and her code status is full code. It is noted that goals of care need"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in blood and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, nothing speciated out yet
   - currently on  aztreonam, gentamycin Day [**2-11**], yesterday vanco and levo
   were d/c
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation and now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - would like to add back gram + coverage as was d/c yesterday given
   flora findings above
   - + gag reflex
   - increased secretions, likely not candidate for extubation today
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - consider restarting lisinopril once acute renal failure improves
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 [**Hospital1 **]), as per notes was suppose to be
   done yesterday but was not, decreased holding parameters to HR < 60 and
   SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and septicemia due to E. coli infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving aztreonam and gentamicin as antibiotics. Her vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Blood cultures have grown E. coli, and sputum culture has shown gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing need for pressure support. Other issues include anemia, acute renal failure, EKG changes indicating demand ischemia, and mild focal LV systolic dysfunction on echo. The patient's mental status is non-responsive, and she has a DNR code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Continued support with mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk of septic shock due to ongoing infection with E. coli. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Monitoring of renal parameters and fluid management are important.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's EKG changes suggest myocardial ischemia, and the echo"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with hypoxemic respiratory failure and now with imroved
   oxygenation and ventilation but with continued barriers to extubation
   primarily driven by persistent secretions and low grade fever.  This,
   it must be noted, is in the setting of rising WBC count.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient with Rx ongoing for probable pulmonary infection.
   -She has had return of gag reflex
   -Her sputum volume had decreased to suctioning every 4 hours by nursing
   with perhaps some additional by respiratory
   -She has maintained reasonable support with PSV at 8/5 with Ve
   requirement of 10 lpm
   -Given fever and WBC increased to 17 will maintain Vanco/Gent
   -Goal is to D/C sedation and trial extubation today
   2)Sepsis-
   -E.Coli seen in urine and blood
   -Sputum not revealing
   -Hemodynamics improved
   -Low grade fevers and rising WBC count are of concern and will maintain
   broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Vanco/Gent to continue
   3)Dementia-
   -Patient described as verbal with one word answers at baseline
   -Will hope to see further improvement with discontinuation of sedating
   medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci. There is some mild
   enteritis as wel as CTl. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended
   down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 8/5 with 40% O2; with thick secretions. O2
   sats in monitor are ok. + Gag reflex. Mental status is non-responsive.
   Patient without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - start vanco back up
   - will decrease pressure support to [**4-9**] and wean sedation, consider
   trial of extubation today
   - + gag reflex, still with thick yellow secretions
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.
   Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - vanc day 2, gentamicin day [**3-13**].
   - Suction PRN
   - will hold on extubation this morning despite excellent vent settings
   secondary to copious secretions
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, re-start tube feedings in the setting of holding
   off on extubation today
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presents from rehab with likely pneumonia and urinary tract infection leading to sepsis. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, respiratory failure, hypertension, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), EKG changes, dementia, and potential complications related to feeding and prophylaxis measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock due to an infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure thought to be due to pneumonia. Continued presence of thick secretions and copious production may indicate ongoing respiratory distress and the need for close monitoring and suctioning.
3. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite medication. Agitation and potential myocardial ischemia are contributing factors that need to be addressed.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit drop suggests anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or infection. Further evaluation is needed, including iron profile and stool studies to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient initially had a creatinine level of 2.0 on admission, indicating ARF. However, the creatinine level has improved to 1.0, suggesting a possible prerenal et"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary
   secretions.  Mental status has been impaired but it is likely near her
   baseline function.  There were extensive discussions with the patient's
   sister and daughter to clarify current clinical course.  They would
   endorse full code status and re-intubation if patient were to fail
   trial of extubation.
   With that clarified patient has had good tolerance of PSV and retains
   altered mental status and pulmonary secretions as the primary barriers
   to extubation.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Has good tolerance of PSV wean but persistent and
   signficiant secreations remain at issue.  She has had improved
   responsiveness.  With suctioning there are fairly high volume of
   secreations noted and suctioning has been every 1-2 hours.  This in
   combination with impaired gag reflex does raise concerns for successful
   extubation.
   -Continue with PSV today
   -Continue with Vanco/Gent
   -Will wake up and re-trial SBT in am
   2)Sepsis-
   -Check C. Diff
   -Check differential
   -Reculture if fever seen
   -This leukocytsis will have to be explained but does not appear to be
   recurrence of sepsis at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with respiratory failure and impaired mental status. She has been in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, blood pressure ranging from 165/67 to 142/57 mmHg, heart rate between 67 and 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is wandering atrial pacemaker, and her weight has increased from 64.8 kg to 77 kg since admission. Her central venous pressure is within normal range, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,615 mL and output of 2,018 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, hydralazine, and heparin for prophylaxis.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, and diminished breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen. Extremities show trace edema in both lower limbs. Skin examination is not performed. Neurologic examination shows the patient responding to verbal stimuli and following commands.

   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - attempt extubation this morning as almost no pressure support
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, will titrate up today to 5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - tube feedings overnight, hold this AM for extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient has experienced several medical complications. These include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to pneumonia. She was placed on pressure support with 40% O2 and had thick secretions. A gag reflex was present, but there were concerns about her ability to clear secretions. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is now almost off pressure support.
2. Sepsis: The patient presented with septic physiology and was found to have E. coli in both her blood and urine. She was started on gentamicin, vancomycin, and cefepime to cover for urosepsis and possible healthcare-associated pneumonia.
3. Hypertension: The patient initially had low blood pressure requiring pressors. However, she is now hypertensive and off all pressors. Her antihypertensive medications were held initially due to hypotension, but she is now being titrated up on lisinopril and metoprolol.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.
   Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - vanc day 2, gentamicin day [**3-13**].
   - Suction PRN
   - will hold on extubation this morning despite excellent vent settings
   secondary to copious secretions
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, re-start tube feedings in the setting of holding
   off on extubation today
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presented from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. The patient has been intubated and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to pneumonia. She is on pressure support with 40% O2 and has thick secretions. There is a concern about extubation due to copious secretions.
2. Hypertension: The patient initially had hypotension but is now hypertensive. Anti-hypertensives are being held, and the patient is being monitored. Lisinopril will be restarted once acute renal failure resolves.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped, and there is a suspicion of chronic disease or infection. A guaiac stool test is pending, and further evaluation is needed.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level was 2.0 on admission but has improved to 1.0 today. It is likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock. The patient's eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula), and an ACE inhibitor may be restarted.
5. EKG Changes: The patient has ST depressions in the setting of sinus tachycardia. This may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (cva), and hypertension. She presented from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) with sepsis physiology. She was intubated and currently on invasive ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 143/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, and her fluid balance is negative 1677 mL since 12 AM. She has received various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, analgesics, and nutritional support. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.0 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.8%, and elevated potassium level (K+) of 5.3 mEq/L. She also has an elevated blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL. The urine culture shows the presence of Escherichia coli and Providencia stuartii, with sensitivities to different antibiotics.

   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia, given sensitivities above will change
   to amikacin and keep vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions, however looks like working harder to breath with tachypnea.
   + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep suctioning this
   morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - will go up on pressure support today to 10 or 12 to improve breathing
   - continue sedation for now
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - restart tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presented from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. She was intubated and put on invasive ventilation. The patient had low potassium levels, which were repleted with IV sliding scale. She received dextrose 50% and pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's fingersticks showed high blood glucose levels, which were managed accordingly.

The patient's respiratory support included oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube and ventilator mode set at CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 414 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results indicated a respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

Physical examination revealed bronchial breath sounds on the right side, while the left lung was more clear. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities were warm and well perfused with trace edema in both feet.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Blood cultures grew E. coli and Providencia stuartii, which were sensitive to multiple antibiotics including amikacin, cefepime, and meropenem. The patient"

   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia, given sensitivities above will change
   to amikacin and keep vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions, however looks like working harder to breath with tachypnea.
   + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep suctioning this
   morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - will go up on pressure support today to 10 or 12 to improve breathing
   - continue sedation for now
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - restart tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presented from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and septic physiology. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been receiving treatment for sepsis with antibiotics and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include the following:
- Invasive ventilation was stopped, but the patient was not ready for extubation due to lots of secretions.
- Medications such as Namenda and Aricept were restarted.
- The patient had low potassium levels that were repleted with IV sliding scale.
- The patient received an ampule of d50 due to fingerstick glucose levels of 61.
- Tube feeds were not restarted in the morning, but were eventually started.
- Stool culture was sent for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) due to suspicion of infection.
- The patient was placed on precautions for C. diff.
- Repeat calcium and phosphate levels were low, which were repleted.
- Repeat urinalysis showed large leukocyte esterase and white blood cells, with urine culture pending.
- The patient was repleted with electrolytes, but phosphate levels did not change.
- Gentamicin level this morning was 3.8.
- Allergies include aspirin, penicillins, and Bactrim (oral), with a rash reaction.

   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - attempt extubation this morning as almost no pressure support
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, will titrate up today to 5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - tube feedings overnight, hold this AM for extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, admitted with urosepsis and respiratory failure. She has shown improvement, with the ventilator weaned down, but still experiencing increased secretions. The patient is off versed overnight and is experiencing diarrhea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function remains a concern due to tachypnea and poor cough readiness for extubation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Fluid overload is evident, which may contribute to pulmonary edema. Diuretic therapy is planned to address this issue.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by E. coli and Providencia. Antibiotic resistance to gentamicin has been noted, so a switch to amikacin is recommended.
4. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's blood pressure remains elevated.
5. Anemia: Although stable, the patient's anemia needs ongoing monitoring.
6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has improved, but close monitoring is necessary.
7. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea should be evaluated further for Clostridium difficile infection.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures are in place to prevent DVT.
9. Stress Ulcer: Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine,
   as well as providencia stuartii in urine. CXR shows bibasilar
   consolidations as well concerning for possible pneumonia. Sputum
   culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown out so far in
   speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl. Presentation
   lactate was 3.4, then trended down.
   - repeat sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-20**]): >25 PMNs and <10
   epithelial cells/100X field. 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM
   POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
   2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH
   OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-22**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL
   FLORA.
   - urine culture 9./17
 no growth final
   - c. diff negative [**8-22**]

   PROVIDENCIA STUARTII.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   - currently on  amikacin and vancomycin, still with tachypneia,
   although secretions have improved
   - allergy to PCN
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   - wbc count continuese to trend up with bandemia
 repeat Ucx is clean,
   c diff negative, may suggest that pneumonia is not being adequately
   treated, however patient remains afebrile
   - chest x-ray from yesterday
   1) No significant change since [**2192-8-21**] with right pleural
   effusion
   and basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
   2) Unchanged support lines and tubes.
   -continue to monitor fever curve, WBC
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**9-9**] with 40% O2; with improved
   secretions, hoever patient remains tachypneic with significant work of
   breathing, patient with  present but impaired gag reflex
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - consider again increasing pressure support
   - off sedation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril today to 5
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID this morning
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
     Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presents from rehabilitation with pneumonia and urosepsis. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, respiratory failure, hypertension, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), EKG changes, dementia, and access issues.

Septic shock: The patient initially had SIRS with E. coli in the blood and urine, as well as providencia stuartii in the urine. The CXR shows bibasilar consolidations, which are concerning for possible pneumonia. The sputum culture with gram-positive cocci has not grown out so far. The repeat sputum culture showed >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, with 3+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The respiratory culture showed sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora. The urine culture showed E. coli and providencia stuartii. The patient is currently on amikacin and vancomycin, still experiencing tachypnea, although secretions have improved.

Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia. She is on pressure support with 40% O2; with improved secretions, however, the patient remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing. The patient has a present but impaired gag reflex.

Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and"

   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine,
   as well as providencia stuartii in urine. CXR shows bibasilar
   consolidations as well concerning for possible pneumonia. Sputum
   culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown out so far in
   speciation. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.  Repeat
   urine culture now negative.
   - repeat sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-20**]): >25 PMNs and <10
   epithelial cells/100X field. 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM
   POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
   2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH

   - currently on  amikacin and vancomycin, still with tachypneia,
   although secretions have improved
   - allergy to PCN
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   - wbc count continuese to trend up with bandemia
 repeat Ucx is clean,
   c diff negative, may suggest that pneumonia is not being adequately
   treated, however patient remains afebrile
   - chest x-ray from yesterday
   1) No significant change since [**2192-8-21**] with right pleural
   effusion
   and basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
   2) Unchanged support lines and tubes.
   -continue to monitor fever curve, WBC
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia. Suspect that also be aspect of deconditioning. Patient on
   pressure support [**11-9**] with 40% O2; with improved secretions, hoever
   patient remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing, patient
   with  present but impaired gag reflex. Rsbi this morning 85.
   - trial of pressure support 8/0 then check after 30 minutes then
   consider vent liberation
   -  iv lasx 20 daily as patient net > 10 liters positive, may be
   impairing ability to get off vent
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - consider again increasing pressure support
   - off sedation
   Mental status
   - decreased mental status even when off the sedating medications, will
   check head CT to ensure that hasn
t had new ischemic event
   Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension,
   now restarted
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril today to 5
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID this morning
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
     Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   baseline.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion
   and septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia, given sensitivities above will change
   to amikacin and keep vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions, however looks like working harder to breath with tachypnea.
   + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep suctioning this
   morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - will go up on pressure support today to 10 or 12 to improve breathing
   - continue sedation for now
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - restart tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, who presents from rehabilitation with pneumonia and urosepsis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, respiratory failure, hypertension, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and possible myocardial ischemia. The patient has shown improvement in her condition, but still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to pneumonia, but she is now showing signs of improvement with the use of pressure support ventilation and suctioning of thick secretions. However, close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is still necessary.

2. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive, and initially, anti-hypertensive medications were withheld due to hypotension. Now that her blood pressure is under control, the goal is to titrate up a beta-blocker as tolerated post-extubation.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped, indicating anemia. It is suspected to be due to chronic disease or infection rather than a massive gastrointestinal bleed. Further investigation and management are needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels were elevated on admission, but have since improved to 0.7. It is likely prerenal"

   82 yo female with respiratory failure and significant and prolonged
   intubation with altered mental status and prominent secretions limiting
   capacity to extubate.  She has tolerated diuresis well with no evidence
   of hemodynamic impact from the diuresis.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Patient has decresed secreations, she has
   persistent altered mental status with decreased responsiveness but no
   localizing findings.  She does cough with suctioning but does not
   follow commands.  She has RSBI <105 with PSV-8/0.  We have tried
   diuresis with some response.
   -Check NIF to evaluate for weakness is attractive but will not be able
   to comply
   -Trial 8/0 for SBT for 30 minutes
   -If favorable will move to extubation
   -If failure of extubation will have to consider tracheostomy

She is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 422 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient has decreased secretions and is tolerating diuretics.
   - She has persistent altered mental status with decreased responsiveness.
   - RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is less than 105 with PSV (pressure support ventilation) set at 8/0.
   - A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 30 minutes will be attempted if there are no contraindications.
   - If the SBT is successful, extubation will be considered.
   - If extubation fails, a tracheostomy may be necessary.

2) ID-Pneumonia:
   - The patient is receiving vancomycin and amikacin.

3) Altered Mental Status:
   - A head CT scan will be performed.
   - Medications Namenda and Aricept will be continued.

ICU Care:
   - Nutrition: 
   - Glycemic control:
   - Lines: multi-lumen and arterial line.
   - Prophylaxis: DVT (deep vein thrombosis) with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, stress ulcer with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
   - Comments: Code status is full code, and the patient will remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine, as
   well as providencia stuartii in urine. CXR shows bibasilar
   consolidations as well concerning for possible pneumonia. Sputum
   culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown out so far in
   speciation. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.  Repeat
   urine culture now negative.
   - repeat sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-20**]): >25 PMNs and <10
   epithelial cells/100X field. 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM
   POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
   2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH
   OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-22**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL
   FLORA.
   - vanc trough 20.7 this AM so she is definitely therapeutic on vanc
   - urine culture 9./17

   10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   - currently on  amikacin and vancomycin, allergy to PCN (previously on
   levoquin and aztreonam as well)
 levoquin was d/c in the setting of
   gram positive cocci in the sputum after 3 day course and aztreonam was
   d/c as no sensitivities identified to e. coli or providenciaa stuartii
   and aztreonam with poor gram + coverage
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   - wbc count continuese to trend up with bandemia
 repeat Ucx is clean,
   c diff negative, may suggest that pneumonia is not being adequately
   treated, however patient remains afebrile, also able to be extubated
   yesterday so clinically improved
   - chest x-ray [**8-24**] - PFI: New right round perihilar mass concerning for
   possible loculated fluid, abscess, tumor.
   - consider ct of chest for furthur evaluation
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia/sepsis. Suspect that also be aspect of deconditioning.
   Patient now off ventilator completely breathing on roomm air.  Given IV
   lasix yesterday had large diuresis
   -  will hold off on additional antibiotics at this time
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
    Mental status
   - patient is now responsive to verbal stimuli, opening her eyes. Will
   squeeze hands in response to her name. moves legs spontaneously.
   Currently not speaking, although as per [**Hospital3 **] at  baseline
   answers with one word
   - may be in the setting of severe illness and previously being on
   sedation that patient has severe dementia at baseline
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension,
   now restarted
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril yesterday to 5, will again increase today to 10
   mg po daily
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID yesterday, will uptitrate to 100 mg TID
   with holding parameters for HR and SBP
   - will hold off on additional lasix today for pressure control
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   baseline.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion
   and septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not
   fresh. Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This was
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. repeat EKG from [**8-20**]
   EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular contractions. Poor R wave
   progression may be lead placement or possible old anterior myocardial
   infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has
   shifted rightward. Ventricular ectopy is new.  ECHO from [**8-20**] -
   IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated right
   ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta.
    Dementia:  patient still with decreased mental status despite being
   off the ventilator.
   - namenda and aricept yesterday
    FEN:
   - tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
    Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea, ppi

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presents with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. She was previously intubated but is now extubated and breathing on her own. The patient has a frothy white secretion from the NG tube. There is a concern for a possible right hilar mass seen on the chest X-ray. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being on antihypertensive medication. The patient's WBC count is elevated with bandemia. The sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The urine culture initially showed E. coli and Providencia stuartii but is now negative. The patient is currently on amikacin and vancomycin due to allergies to penicillins. The patient's mental status has improved since being extubated, but she still exhibits decreased mental status. The patient has anemia with a hematocrit drop, normocytic normochromic, and an iron profile suggesting chronic disease or infection. The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine from 0.6 to 2.0 but has improved to 1.2 today. The patient's EKG shows ST depressions and premature ventricular contractions. The patient has mild focal LV systolic dysfunction and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation on the echo. The patient's blood glucose levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine, as
   well as providencia stuartii in urine. CXR shows bibasilar
   consolidations as well concerning for possible pneumonia. Sputum
   culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown out so far in
   speciation. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.  Repeat
   urine culture now negative.
   - repeat sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-20**]): >25 PMNs and <10
   epithelial cells/100X field. 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM
   POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
   2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH
   OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-22**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL
   FLORA.
   - urine culture 9./17

   10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   - currently on  amikacin and vancomycin, allergy to PCN
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   - wbc count continuese to trend up with bandemia
 repeat Ucx is clean,
   c diff negative, may suggest that pneumonia is not being adequately
   treated, however patient remains afebrile, also able to be extubated
   yesterday
   - chest x-ray [**8-24**] - PFI: New right round perihilar mass concerning for
   possible loculated fluid,
   abscess, tumor.
   - with concern for above findings, ordered ct chest and head
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia. Suspect that also be aspect of deconditioning. Patient on
   pressure support [**11-9**] with 40% O2; with improved secretions, hoever
   patient remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing, patient
   with  present but impaired gag reflex. Rsbi this morning 85.
   - off ventilator
   -  iv lasix 20 daily as patient net > 10 liters positive, cont to
   monitor i/os
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
    Mental status
   - decreased mental status , will check head CT
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension,
   now restarted
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril yesterday to 5, will again increase today
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID yesterday, will continue to uptitrate
   as tolerated
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   baseline.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion
   and septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not
   fresh. Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This was
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. repeat EKG from [**8-20**]
   EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular contractions. Poor R wave
   progression may be lead placement or possible old anterior myocardial
   infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has
   shifted rightward. Ventricular ectopy is new.  ECHO from [**8-20**] -
   IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated right
   ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta.
    Dementia:  patient still with decreased mental status despite being
   off the ventilator.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. The patient successfully underwent extubation yesterday but remains on noninvasive ventilation support. She has a right hilar mass seen on chest X-ray and has been experiencing episodes of hypertension. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 183/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is alert and oriented to person, but her mental status is decreased. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Despite being extubated, she remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing. This suggests that her respiratory function may still be compromised.
2. Hypertension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypertension, indicating uncontrolled blood pressure. This could lead to complications such as end-organ damage or stroke.
3. Infection: The patient has had multiple infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and possible oropharyngeal flora in the respiratory culture. These infections need to be closely monitored and treated appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped, indicating anemia. This could be due to"
