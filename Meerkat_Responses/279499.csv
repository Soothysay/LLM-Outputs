   4) Fever
   Patient with GI bleeding and pronounced anemia. ERCP shows evidence of
   bleeding, likely from tumor. Hct has drifted down since transfusion.
   Needs additional transfusion now. If bleeding persists, will need
   angiography.
   Metabolic acidosis with anion gap. Lactate levels up mildly. No renal
   failure, no hx of DM, no hx to suggest ingestion. With fever, may have
   lactate related to septic physiology and/or volume depletion. Patient
   appears persistently volume depleted. Will switch from normal saline to
   lactated ringers; use boluses for urine output less than 50 cc/hr.
   Patient on antibiotics for possible cholangitis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of hypotension, gastrointestinal bleed, and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) this morning, during which the area of the tumor was cauterized due to risk of rebleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but still requires additional transfusion. The patient has a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with spread to the liver, pancreas, and duodenum. The patient also has a stent in the pancreatic duct.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Since the patient underwent ERCP and the area of the tumor was cauterized, there is a potential risk of rebleeding.
2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for possible cholangitis, indicating a risk of infection.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap and mildly elevated lactate levels.
4. Volume Depletion: Despite receiving fluids, the patient appears persistently volume depleted.
5. Septic Physiology: The fever and elevated lactate levels may suggest septic physiology, possibly related to volume depletion or infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration continues to drift down since transfusion, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The source of bleeding was identified as a pancreatic lesion during an ERCP procedure.
- The patient's hemodynamic status has been stable overnight, with a hematocrit (Hct) level in the mid-20s.
- The patient's blood work showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly elevated platelet count, and normal liver function tests (LFTs).
- There are indications of potential infection, such as the presence of bacteria in blood cultures (BCx) and urine cultures (Ucx), as well as transient cholangitis.
- The patient's platelet count is now below 50, but there are no signs of active bleeding. The possible causes for thrombocytopenia include consumptive coagulopathy, dilutional thrombocytopenia from blood transfusions, or sequestration in the spleen.
- The patient has lactic acidosis with a gap of 15, which has improved from the previous lactate level of 1.3.
- The patient's pain control needs are being addressed, considering his history of metastatic RCC.
- The patient's current medications include Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT), melena (darkened stools), recent fever, and hypotension. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) secondary to bleeding metastasis. He was recently admitted and underwent an angiography to stop the bleeding. The patient also had a pancreatic ampullary stent placed in the past. Currently, the patient reports darkened stools after starting iron tablets, indicating a possible upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. Other potential sources of bleeding include peptic ulcer disease (PUD), arteriovenous malformation (AVM), colitis, or hemorrhoids. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is being monitored for melena and given two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He is also receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and guaiacol test (GUI) for stool sample analysis. The source of bleeding is likely UGI in nature due to the presence of melena and past history of tumor-related bleeding. Other possibilities include PUD, AVM, colitis, or hemorrhoids. The patient is on NPO status (nothing by mouth), and further recommendations from the GI team are appreciated.

2. Infection: The patient has a fever, slightly elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a duodenal met that was likely the source of bleeding. The bleeding was cauterized, but the patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a stable hemoglobin level.

The patient's lactate level has improved from 3.3 to 1.8, indicating better tissue perfusion. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Zosyn/vanco) and pantoprazole (Protonix). The cultures are pending. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 129 bpm and blood pressure within normal limits. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 94%. The patient has received various medications, including metoprolol, furosemide, and lasix.

The flow sheet data indicates that the patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products over the past 24 hours. The balance shows a net loss of 466 mL. The patient's urine output is within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient not being assessed in certain areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and others.

He has been hemodynamically stable overnight, but his hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from 29.3 to 26.9, and he is experiencing tachycardia and bloody diarrhea. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight, but his Hct did not increase, and it remains in the mid-to-high 20s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), potential cholangitis, and anxiety. The patient has been experiencing bloody diarrhea and a hematocrit (Hct) level that did not increase after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but remains at risk for further bleeding. 

The patient has a history of RCC with metastasis and has undergone ERCP, which revealed a pancreatic lesion as the likely cause of the GIB. Interventional radiology (IR) and angiography were performed, but no active extravasation was found, and the extent of the tumor and risk for ischemia to the bowel make further angio intervention unhelpful. The patient is also not a candidate for surgery or ERCP.

The plan is to have a family meeting today to discuss the patient's goals of care, considering that there are no other interventions possible to stop future bleeding. The patient will be transfused as needed, with two peripheral IV lines, and will have regular hemoglobin and hematocrit checks. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will be continued, and stool guaiac testing will be monitored. 

In terms of infection, the patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and cultures have been obtained. The patient remains afebrile, and liver function tests ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and cholangitis. The patient has experienced increased bleeding overnight, leading to tachycardia but no hypotension. An intervention by interventional radiology showed no active extravasation. The patient is afebrile and has diminished abdominal tenderness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's condition can worsen if there is significant blood loss leading to hypotension and shock.
2. Infection: Cholangitis indicates an infection in the bile ducts, which can potentially spread and lead to systemic infection.
3. Organ failure: The patient's critically ill state and compromised organ function due to the underlying tumor and ongoing bleeding can result in organ failure.
4. Coagulopathy: Repeated bleeding and the use of blood products can disrupt the patient's coagulation balance, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Malnutrition: Given the patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and the need for clear liquids only, there is a risk of malnutrition if proper nutritional support is not provided.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots, which can travel to the lungs causing a potentially life-threatening condition.
7. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring healthcare"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), potential cholangitis, and anxiety. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has a history of RCC with duodenal metastasis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and 2 liters of normal saline for tachycardia. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate ongoing GIB. This can lead to significant blood loss, shock, and organ failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Cholangitis: The patient may have cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. This can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially considering his GIB.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis and appropriate antibiotic coverage is"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of passing clots and having melena stools. He received one additional unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) yesterday and 2 liters of normal saline (NS) for tachycardia, with stable hematocrit (Hct).

The patient made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) decision. He is receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), which will be continued for a 7-day course. The patient is also on lorazepam for anxiety and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/92 to 157/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient has sinus tachycardia on ECG.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), with values ranging from 17.4 to 49 x 10^9/L. Other lab results include elevated creatinine (Cr), glucose, lactic acid, and liver enzymes such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, as well as thrombocytopenia. The patient has been receiving blood products and fluids throughout the night. Vital signs include a temperature of 100.4°F, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 147/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of fever and mild tachycardia. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no acute distress, and the presence of an I/VI systolic murmur at the base. Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 17.4 K/uL, platelet count of 49 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and sodium level of 119 mg/dL, among other values. The patient's Hct has been drifting down slowly, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate replacement. The patient has been hemodynamically stable, but has not responded to fluids. The plan includes continued ICU care with oral nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a serious condition that requires immediate attention. There is a risk of continued bleeding, hemorrhagic shock, and potential need for blood transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, indicated by elevated white blood cell count and potential transient cholangitis. Monitoring for fever and infection parameters is crucial to prevent the progression of infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and transfusion of platelets may be necessary.
4. Metastatic RCC: The patient's underlying malignancy, metastatic RCC, continues to progress and cause complications. Pain management and consideration of palliative chemotherapy options are being discussed with the family.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, as there is a significant difference between the total input and output. This may indicate fluid overload or ongoing losses that need to be addressed.
6. Hypothermia: The patient has experienced episodes of hypothermia, which may be due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), potential cholangitis, and anxiety. The patient is currently being transfused PRN and the family is considering possible hospital hospice. The patient's fever has resolved, white blood cell count is trending down, and liver function tests are improving. The patient's platelet count is low, and they are at risk for bleeding. The patient's pain is controlled, and hematology/oncology has offered one final round of chemotherapy but with caution due to the risk of exacerbating duodenal bleeding. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may lead to significant blood loss and shock if not properly managed.
2. Infection: Despite improving trends in WBC count and LFTs, there is a potential risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count puts them at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Metastatic RCC progression: The patient's underlying metastatic RCC may continue to progress despite current management, leading to further complications and deterioration of health status.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's tachycardia and recent transfusions may contribute to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiovascular"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed, anemia, and metastatic cancer. The patient received 2 units of blood transfusion last night and has been given 1 liter of fluid for tachycardia without much change in heart rate. The patient is requesting more frequent doses of Ativan and still has a low-grade fever.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical issues, including impaired gait, muscle performance, and transfers, anxiety, fever (possibly due to cholangitis), and ongoing gastrointestinal bleed. The patient requires ongoing blood transfusions and remains hemodynamically stable. It is unclear if the tachycardia is related to volume status as there was no response to fluid challenges. The patient remains anxious and is on antibiotics for presumed cholangitis. There is ongoing discussion with palliative care regarding the transfer to inpatient hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever, which could indicate an underlying infection. Cholangitis is suspected and the patient is on antibiotics, but further evaluation is needed.

2. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a significant concern. The patient requires ongoing blood transfusions to maintain hemodynamic stability.

3. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's tachycardia may be related to volume status or infection."
