   86 yo Iranian (farsi speaking) male with h/o COPD (on home o2 (uses
   2-3h qdaily of home o2 overall), HTN, restless leg syndrome, BPH
   transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure:  Improving on
   Bipap.  Patient was initiated on Bipap after transfer to ICU and
   achieved RR around 40 and MV around 30.  Patient also recieved one dose
   of narcan.  After 2 hrs, patient's ABG improved to 7.25/64/97.  Patient
   has been more awake and agitated -- a sign that his mental status
   improving.  At Patient's ABG this afternoon was consistent with acute
   on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient is on home O2 and
   has had previosu Bicarbs around 33 per chem 7s.  Patient's change in
   mental status related to hypercarbia.  Patient's decreased ventilation
   is from decreased respiratory drive from increased NC oxygen,
   narcotics, and possibly from constipation.  Patient
s CXR with possible
   bronchitis, given his cough and shortness of breath prior to the
   admission.
   - Continue BiPap and transition to NC
   - Recheck ABG in PM
   - Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs
   - Continue Azithromycin 500mg IV q24
   - Avoid sedating medications.  Will need pain control as patient has
   been on methadone for seven years.
   - Narcan prn
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Pre renal likely.  Admitted with Cr
   2.6m baseline Cr 1.8-2.0. History of poor po intake is suspicous for
   pre-renal etiology.  There was concern that patient may be retaining
   overnight secondary to BPH and had foley placed.
   - Continue foley
   - NS 1L bolus, then 100cc/hr
   - Continue Tamsulosin and Finasteride

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
- The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- On BiPap, the patient achieved a respiratory rate around 40 and minute ventilation around 30. After 2 hours, the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) improved to 7.25/64/97.
- The patient is more awake and agitated, indicating an improvement in mental status.
- The patient's previous bicarbonate levels were around 33, and his change in mental status is related to hypercarbia.
- The patient's decreased ventilation is due to decreased respiratory drive from increased NC oxygen, narcotics, and possibly constipation.
- The patient has a possible bronchitis on chest X-ray, given his cough and shortness of breath prior to admission.
- The plan is to continue BiPap and transition to nasal cannula, recheck ABG in the afternoon, administer Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs, continue Azithromycin 500mg IV q24, avoid sedating medications, provide pain control, and use Narcan as needed.
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal. The baseline"

   transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure:  Improved on Bipap.
   On narcan drip. Patient has been more awake.  Patient is on home O2 and
   has had previosu Bicarbs around 33 per chem 7s.  Patient's change in
   mental status related to hypercarbia.  Patient's decreased ventilation
   is from decreased respiratory drive from increased NC oxygen,
   narcotics, and possibly from constipation.  Patient

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on BiPAP support. The patient's mental status is related to hypercarbia, and his decreased ventilation may be due to increased NC oxygen, narcotics, and possibly constipation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has shown improvement with the BiPAP. He is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, pre-renal likely, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.8-2.0 and an elevated level of 2.6 on admission. There is suspicion of pre-renal etiology due to poor oral intake, and the patient has had a Foley catheter placed. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, microcytic, with a hematocrit level of 29.5. The patient is also diagnosed with restless leg syndrome controlled on home dose methadone, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications if not properly managed. The high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood can cause respiratory acidosis, which can result in confusion, decreased consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration could lead to electrolyte"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently improving on 3 liters nasal cannula. His baseline PCO2 is around 70-80 likely. The plan is to continue BiPap as needed, recheck ABG, administer Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs, continue Azithromycin 500mg IV q24, and provide intermittent Fentanyl boluses with Narcan gtt.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, pre-renal etiology, with an improved creatinine level from 2.6 to 1.9. He is advised to discontinue the Foley catheter, continue normal saline at 100cc/hr while NPO, continue Tamsulosin and Finasteride, hold home lasix, and follow up with electrolytes/chemistries.

Additionally, the patient has restless leg syndrome controlled on home dose methadone, which will be held due to acute respiratory compromise and possible hypoventilation. Fentanyl will be considered prn.

The patient has anemia, microcytic, with a history of thalassemia and a hematocrit level of 31.2. Monitoring is recommended.

Other notable points include prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code"

The patient was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and acute on chronic renal failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/69 to 120/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with normal eyes and head/ears/nose/throat. The patient has diminished pulses in both right and left dorsal pedis (DP) and absent radial pulses. The respiratory system shows diminished breath sounds bilaterally, while the abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and distention. The patient is unable to stand due to muscle wasting. Neurological examination reveals increased muscle tone and sedation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, partial"

   # Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure:  Improving.
   Patient
s mental status is at baseline now oriented to self and yr by
   his calendar. This was thought to  be secondary to methadone overdose
   (due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs
   rather than 5mg tabs from his pharmacy).  He required BiPAP the first
   day in the ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was
   started on a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.
   His narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert and
   speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan while in the
   ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless leg syndrome.  He
   was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which was continued x2 days.
   It was later discontinued to help further clear his mental status.  He
   was also started on azithromycin 500mg IV q24 for COPD exacerbation
   which was switched to PO on [**2140-4-9**].  On [**4-9**] his home dose of
   methadone was restarted 15mg PO BID.  Pt is on 2L oxygen at home but
   taken off oxygen this AM with goal O2 sat 88-92% as likely is chronic
   CO2 retainer.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
This was pre renal in etiology and pt
   with poor etiology.  His creatinine was 2.6 on admission which improved
   to his baseline of 1.8-2.  He was continued on NS @100cc/hr while NPO.
   He was continued on his Tamsulosin and Finasteride.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo Iranian (farsi speaking) male with h/o COPD (on home o2 (uses
   2-3h qdaily of home o2 overall), HTN, restless leg syndrome, BPH
   transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure:  Improving.
   Patient
s mental status is at baseline now oriented to self and yr by
   his calendar. This was thought to  be secondary to methadone overdose
   (due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs
   rather than 5mg tabs from his pharmacy).  He required BiPAP the first
   day in the ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was
   started on a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.
   His narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert and
   speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan while in the
   ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless leg syndrome.  He
   was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which was continued x2 days.
   It was later discontinued to help further clear his mental status.  He
   was also started on azithromycin 500mg IV q24 for COPD exacerbation
   which was switched to PO on [**2140-4-9**].
   - Narcan gtt with intermittent Fentanyl boluses
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Pre renal.  Improved with IVFs to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, restless leg syndrome, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is believed to be secondary to methadone overdose. The patient required BiPAP initially due to a high PCO2 level on the floor and later improved with narcan gtt. He is currently on fentanyl boluses and ativan for withdrawal and restless leg syndrome.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal in nature, as indicated by his poor oral intake and elevated creatinine levels. He is being managed with IV fluids, holding home lasix, and monitoring electrolytes and chemistries.

The patient has a history of thalassemia, resulting in microcytic anemia. It is being monitored, and no specific treatment is mentioned.

The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, lorazepam, fentanyl, and tamsulosin with finasteride for BPH. His code status is full code, and his disposition is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypercarbic respiratory failure, exacerbation of COPD, further deterioration of renal function, and potential infections due to indwelling lines or catheters."
