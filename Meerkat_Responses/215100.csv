   respiratory motion. Underlying moderate emphysema at the lung apices.
   Atherosclerotic disease. Comparison to prior OSH images will be useful,
   please have these uploaded to [**Hospital1 19**] PACS
   system.
   Microbiology: Legionella urinary Ag (-)
   Assessment and Plan:  83M with sCHF (EF 40%), presenting from OSH with
   acute hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP, unexplained
   hemoptysis and acute on CKI.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented from an
   OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last p02 of 60 on
   FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of failure
   includes BOOP, CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's
   syndrome, and VAP.  No evidence of emphasematous changes on recent
   imaging to suggest obstructive physiology.
   - will upload outside hospital imaging
   - will wean steroids
   - will convert to meropenem for Klebsiella in sputum, repeat sputum cx,
   follow up sensitivies
   - see below for CHF management
   .
   # Question BOOP/COP: Patient with symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis.
   Evidence on CT noted above in history. Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA
   were noted to be negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  The patient is now
   s/p  days of 0.5 gm of Solumedrol. Patients last PFTs were noted to be
   consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   - Upload CT Chest into records -> f/u in PACS
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
   - begin steroid wean to once daily methylprednisolone
   - will repeat ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM
   .
   #. Chronic Systolic CHF: Pt with last known EF of 40%. Now appears to
   be clinically hypervolemic with likely intravascular depletion.
   Diuresis unsuccessful yesterday, per report, now appears to be
   improving according to physician at OSH.
   - repeat TTE this morning
   - will place on lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 2.5 liters today
   - favor optimizing CHF regimen with afterload reduction -> will start
   isosorbide mononitrate, avoid ACEi given tenuous renal fxn, B blockade
   given 1^st degree AV block
   .
   # CAD s/p angioplasty, stent x 1:  troponin elevated, CK and MB
   normal.  Given recent history of hemoptysis and possible RML
   hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, and no significant ECG changes from
   admission to OSH, will defer anti-platelet and anti-coagulation at this
   time.  Will continue to trend and continue ASA 325 mg daily
   - hold statin in setting of transaminitis
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: DDx includes prerenal azotemia (poor
   forward flow, intravascular depletion), intrinsic, post-renal. Although
   now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis,
   hyperkalemia to sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may
   require HD vs CVVH given azotemia.  Steroid-induced catabolic state
   likely etiology of elevated BUN.
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   - UA with sediment and cx
   - Urine Lytes
   - f/u Renal recs, appreciate recs
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia- suspect intravascular volume depletion in setting of
   recent diuresis and elevated BUN, serum osmolality.
   -  will correct free water deficit with D5W, 1.7 liters to correct to
   148 in next 8 hours
   -  serial Na

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney injury (CKI), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the ICU with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with severe respiratory distress requiring invasive ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's recent imaging does not show any evidence of obstructive physiology.

2. BOOP/COP: The patient has symptoms of dyspnea and hemoptysis, along with evidence of BOOP on CT imaging. Autoantibodies such as ANCA were negative, and the pathology report confirmed BOOP. The patient received 0.5 gm of Solumedrol for treatment and is currently undergoing steroid weaning.

3. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a known ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. He appears to be clinically hypervolemic with likely intravascular depletion. Diuresis was unsuccessful yesterday but improved today. The plan is to repeat a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) this morning, place the patient on lasix g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (EF 40%), presenting from an outside hospital (OSH) with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), unexplained hemoptysis, and acute on chronic kidney injury. The patient underwent angioplasty and stenting for coronary artery disease but has elevated troponin levels. The patient also has hypernatremia, type II diabetes mellitus, and is suspected to have MRSA infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure and requires invasive ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes BOOP, congestive heart failure (CHF), ANCA-associated vasculitis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a known ejection fraction of 40% and appears to be clinically hypervolemic with likely intravascular depletion. Optimizing CHF regimen with afterload reduction is recommended.
3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient has an elevated BUN of 200, and the differential diagnosis includes prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal injury, and post-renal obstruction. Renal function tests and imaging should be followed up.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and correction of free water"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic CHF, presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure. He has evidence of bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, multifocal peribronchial opacities suggesting infection, and moderate emphysema at the lung apices. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, requiring invasive ventilation. He has a Foley catheter in place, and his urine output has been noted to be low. The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia. His renal function is impaired, with elevated BUN and creatinine levels. He also has an elevated troponin level, suggesting possible myocardial injury or ischemia. The patient's current medical conditions include acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), and chronic kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function may wors"

   # Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented from an
   OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last p02 of 60 on
   FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of failure
   includes BOOP, CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's
   syndrome, and VAP.  No evidence of emphasematous changes on recent
   imaging to suggest obstructive physiology.
   - will upload outside hospital imaging
   - will wean steroids

   # Question BOOP/COP: Patient with symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis.
   Evidence on CT noted above in history. Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA
   were noted to be negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  The patient is now
   s/p  days of 0.5 gm of Solumedrol. Patients last PFTs were noted to be
   consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   - Upload CT Chest into records -> f/u in PACS

   be clinically hypervolemic with likely intravascular depletion.
   Diuresis unsuccessful yesterday, per report, now appears to be
   improving according to physician at OSH.
   - repeat TTE this morning
   - will place on lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 2.5 liters today
   - favor optimizing CHF regimen with afterload reduction -> will start
   isosorbide mononitrate, avoid ACEi given tenuous renal fxn, B blockade
   given 1^st degree AV block

   # CAD s/p angioplasty, stent x 1:  troponin elevated, CK and MB
   normal.  Given recent history of hemoptysis and possible RML
   hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, and no significant ECG changes from
   admission to OSH, will defer anti-platelet and anti-coagulation at this

   Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to moderate
   restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were
   noted to be negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury. The patient's last known ejection fraction (EF) was 40%, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows a slight decline in systolic function with clear volume overload. The patient has been sedated and intubated since transfer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure, which can be caused by various factors such as congestive heart failure (CHF), ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or obstructive lung disease. The patient's imaging from outside the hospital shows a clear right middle lobe (RML) hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. Systolic heart failure is likely the primary component.

2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with a last known EF of 40%. The TTE shows a slight decline in systolic function with clear volume overload. The patient appears to be clinically hypervolemic.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) post angioplasty and stent: The patient had elevated troponin levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), hypernatremia, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to severe CAD and pulmonary edema seen on CT chest. This could be related to his underlying CHF.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has severe coronary atherosclerosis, which may have contributed to his current condition.
3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of left ventricular enlargement, moderate pulmonary edema, and moderate nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions on imaging. These findings suggest chronic systolic heart failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high serum sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia.
6. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has a history of type II diabetes, which may contribute to his overall health issues.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has severe atheros"

   Assessment and Plan:  83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from
   OSH with acute hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and
   acute on CKI.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented from an
   OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last p02 of 60 on
   FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of failure
   includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome,
   VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).
   Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to moderate
   restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were
   noted to be negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart
   failure, as evidence by TTE, likely primary component.
   - son to attempt to obtain non-cont CT chest done prior to [**2139-1-5**]
   bronch
   - will cont to wean methylpred to 40 mg daily tomorrow
   - BAL today
   - f/u repeat vasculitis serologies
   - Klebsiella resistant only to amp, will convert [**Last Name (un) 614**] to cipro
   - see below for CHF management
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
   .
   #. Chronic Systolic CHF: Pt with last known EF of 40%. Now appears to
   be clinically hypervolemic with likely intravascular depletion.
   Diuresis unsuccessful yesterday, per report, now appears to be
   improving according to physician at OSH.
   - repeat TTE this morning
   - will place on lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 2.5 liters today
   - favor optimizing CHF regimen with afterload reduction -> will start
   isosorbide mononitrate, avoid ACEi given tenuous renal fxn, B blockade
   given 1^st degree AV block
   .
   # CAD s/p angioplasty, stent x 1:  troponin elevated, CK and MB
   normal.  Given recent history of hemoptysis and possible RML
   hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, and no significant ECG changes from
   admission to OSH, will defer anti-platelet and anti-coagulation at this
   time.  Will continue to trend and continue ASA 325 mg daily
   - hold statin in setting of transaminitis
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: DDx includes prerenal azotemia (poor
   forward flow, intravascular depletion), intrinsic, post-renal. Although
   now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis,
   hyperkalemia to sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may
   require HD vs CVVH given azotemia.  Steroid-induced catabolic state
   likely etiology of elevated BUN.
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   - UA with sediment and cx

   #.  Hypernatremia- suspect intravascular volume depletion in setting of
   recent diuresis and elevated BUN, serum osmolality.
   -  will correct free water deficit with D5W, 1.7 liters to correct to
   148 in next 8 hours

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is hypoxic respiratory failure, and he presented from an outside hospital (OSH) with acute on chronic conditions including systolic heart failure, chronic kidney injury, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypernatremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 171/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and intubated in the ICU.

The patient has a history of CAD, which was treated with angioplasty and stenting. He also has chronic kidney injury, as indicated by an elevated BUN of 200 mg/dL. The patient's diabetes is uncontrolled, with blood sugars difficult to manage. He is currently on insulin gtt but may require adjustment.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Imaging from outside shows evidence of mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect. Autoantibodies such as ANNA were negative, and path report confirms BOOP.

The patient's heart failure is chronic systolic with a last"

   acute on CKI.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented from an
   OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last p02 of 60 on
   FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of failure
   includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome,
   VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).
   Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to moderate
   restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were
   noted to be negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart
   failure, as evidence by TTE, likely primary component.
   - son to attempt to obtain non-cont CT chest done prior to [**2139-1-5**]

   - see below for CHF management
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
   .
   #. Chronic Systolic CHF: Pt with last known EF of 40%. TTE shows slight
   decline in systolic function with clear volume overload. Now appears to
   be clinically hypervolemic.
   - cont lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 4 liters today
   - cont afterload reduction with isosorbide, avoiding ACEi given renal
   fxn, avoiding B blockade given 1^st degree heart block
   .
   # CAD s/p angioplasty, stent x 1:  troponin elevated, CK and MB
   normal.  Given recent history of hemoptysis and possible RML
   hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, and no significant ECG changes from
   admission to OSH, will defer anti-platelet and anti-coagulation at this
   time.  Will continue to trend and continue ASA 325 mg daily.  Repeat
   ECG unchanged yesterday.
   - hold statin in setting of transaminitis
   - troponin stable, will stop trending
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: DDx includes prerenal azotemia (poor
   forward flow, intravascular depletion), intrinsic, post-renal. Although
   now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis,
   hyperkalemia to sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may
   require HD vs CVVH given azotemia.  Steroid-induced catabolic state
   likely etiology of elevated BUN.
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   - UA with sediment and cx
   - Urine Lytes
   - f/u Renal recs, appreciate recs
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia- suspect intravascular volume depletion in setting of
   recent diuresis and elevated BUN, serum osmolality.
   -  will correct free water deficit with D5W, 1.7 liters to correct to
   148 in next 8 hours
   -  serial Na
   .
   # Altered Mental Status- Patient has not been alert/interactive since
   transfer.  Sedation held for period of time yesterday, without
   improvement.  No clonus on exam, although significant uremia likely
   contributing to altered mental status.
   - will attempt daily awakenings, wean sedation

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was placed on a ventilator with settings of 10 cmH2O PEEP and 40% FiO2. The last p02 was 60 on FiO2, PEEP 10, so the FiO2 was increased to 50%. Differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from OSH). Autoantibodies such as ANNA were negative. Path report confirmed bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Imaging from outside hospital shows clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. Systolic heart failure, as evidenced by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), likely represents the primary component.

   Assessment and Plan:  83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from
   OSH with acute hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and
   acute on CKI.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented from an
   OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last p02 of 60 on
   FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of failure
   includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome,
   VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).
   Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to moderate
   restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were
   noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w
   BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage
   post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart failure, as evidence by TTE, is
   likely the primary component.
   - son to attempt to obtain non-cont CT chest on [**2138-12-22**], done prior to
   first bronchoscopy
   - will cont to wean methylpred to 20 mg daily tomorrow
   - f/u BAL results
   - repeat vasculitis serologies are negative
   - Klebsiella resistant only to amp, will cont cipro today day [**2-15**]
   - see below for CHF management
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
   .
   #. Chronic Systolic CHF: Pt with last known EF of 40%. TTE shows slight
   decline in systolic function with clear volume overload. Now appears to
   be clinically hypervolemic.
   - cont lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 4 liters today
   - cont afterload reduction with isosorbide, avoiding ACEi given renal
   fxn, avoiding B blockade given 1^st degree heart block
   .
   # CAD s/p angioplasty, stent x 1:  troponin elevated, CK and MB
   normal.  Given recent history of hemoptysis and possible RML
   hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, and no significant ECG changes from
   admission to OSH, will defer anti-platelet and anti-coagulation at this
   time.  Will continue to trend and continue ASA 325 mg daily.  Repeat
   ECG unchanged yesterday.
   - hold statin in setting of transaminitis
   - troponin stable, will stop trending
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: DDx includes prerenal azotemia (poor
   forward flow, intravascular depletion), intrinsic. Although now with
   signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis,
   hyperkalemia to sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may
   require HD vs CVVH given azotemia.  Steroid-induced catabolic state
   likely etiology of elevated BUN.  Creatinine stable at 2 and unchanged
   from [**2139-1-5**].
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   - U/A with sediment and cx
   - Urine Lytes
   - f/u Renal recs, appreciate recs, cont with aggressive diuresis
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia- free water deficit likely [**2-10**] mechanical
   ventilation.  Patient may have DI, difficult to assess in setting of
   diuresis.
   -  will correct free water deficit with D5W
   -  serial Na
   .
   # Altered Mental Status- Patient has not been alert/interactive since
   transfer.  Sedation held for period of time yesterday, without
   improvement.  No clonus on exam, although significant uremia likely
   contributing to altered mental status.
   - will attempt daily awakenings, hold sedation
   - pt may need additional eval tomorrow if no improvement, e.g. further
   imaging, LP, EEG, etc
   .
   #.  Type II DM- convert to insulin gtt.

   Disposition:  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to a complication of his underlying heart failure. Other potential complications that could arise include worsening of chronic kidney disease, exacerbation of peripheral vascular disease, and further deterioration in mental status.

The patient's current medical management includes mechanical ventilation, diuresis for fluid overload, and insulin therapy for hyperglycemia. The patient is also on prophylactic medications such as SC heparin for deep vein thrombosis prevention, ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin T, indicating possible ongoing myocardial injury and systemic inflammation. The patient's kidney function remains impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, likely due to free water deficit exacerbated by mechanical ventilation.

Further evaluation and management should focus on weaning off sedation and assessing neurological status, optimizing heart failure management including diuresis and afterload reduction, monitoring and treating renal function, managing diabetes mellitus, and ensuring adequate nutrition. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, and"

   signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis,
   hyperkalemia to sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may
   require HD vs CVVH given azotemia.  Steroid-induced catabolic state

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 12627**] and reviewed his historical, lab, and
   imaging data. I also was present for the key portion of the services
   provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9827**]
s note above and concur with his
   findings and plan of care.
   Mr [**Known lastname 12627**] suffers from acute resp failure which seems in part due to
   CHF and in part due to hemorrhage in the locale of OSH TBBX.  Though
   that small bx has been read as c/w BOOP, this is a hard dx to make on
   TBBx and pt has not a response to steroids.  In fact since being on
   steroids his BUN has risen and is now near 160.  This may be playing a
   role in his being obtunded, as patient also has renal failure.  We are
   treating Klebsiella resp infection with Cipro and also increasing free
   H20 to Rx hypernatremia.  The goals today are to make I/0 2 liters neg,
   to increase free water, to lower steroids in an effort to lower BUN,
   and to keep him on A/C ventilation without sedation, hoping for an
   improvement in mental status.  We have discussed our thoughts and
   concerns with his son who was at the bedside this morning.
   40 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. He also has renal failure, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate cardiac output. This can result in pulmonary edema, increased dyspnea, and decreased cardiac function.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not addressed appropriately. This can lead to further elevation of creatinine and BUN levels, fluid imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, and potential complications like uremia.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be corrected to prevent dehydration and potential neurological complications.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's obtundation may be due to various factors such as uremia, steroid use, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause is crucial to improve mental status.
6. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for a suspected Klebsiella respiratory infection. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoexmic respiratory failure, which may be due to CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis, VAP, or obstructive lung disease.

2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a known EF of 40% and shows signs of volume overload. This indicates a decline in systolic function.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had an angioplasty and stent placement, but troponin levels are elevated, suggesting myocardial injury.

4. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury (CKI): The patient's BUN is elevated at 200, and creatinine is stable at 2. This suggests prerenal azotemia or intrinsic renal failure.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which may be due to free water deficit from mechanical ventilation.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient is not alert or interactive, possibly due to sedation or significant uremia.

7. Type II DM: The patient requires conversion to insulin gtt for glycemic control.

8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots and SC heparin.

9. Bowel Regimen: The patient is on a bowel regimen.

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF), renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM) type II, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient is currently sedated and unresponsive due to mechanical ventilation support.

24-hour events include bronchoscopy, ultrasound of the gallbladder (GB), and changes in antibiotics based on Klebsiella sensitivity. Renal recommendations include maintaining a sodium level of 144, checking urine electrolytes for evidence of diabetes insipidus, and diuresis.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including insulin, furosemide (Lasix), ranitidine (prophylaxis), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/50 to 165/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 105.5 kg at admission to 104.1 kg currently.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 12627**], and reviewed his historical, lab, and
   imaging data. I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided and also have spoken at some length with the patient
s son,
   [**Name (NI) 453**].  I have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9827**]
s note above and agree with his
   findings and plan of care.  There are several issues active in this
   gentleman with multiorgan system failure
   1)       Cardiac
 there is new hypotension and lateral EKG changes and
   a further increase in troponin in this man with known CAD and CHF and
   EF of 35%.  We will give ASA and transfuse to increase 02 delivery to
   heart.  For now BP is being supported with Dopamine.
   2)       Hypotension
 his BP has dropped, as above, and he
s developed
   a fever. It
s not totally clear if this is cardiac or septic, but in
   any case he has lactic acidosis.  The pt has been cultured up and Zosyn
   and Vanc started pending culture results. Steroids also increased to
   stress levels.
   3)       Renal Failure -  pt is in frank renal failure with oliguria,
   BUN of 173 and Cr increased to 2.3, along with hyperkalemia and
   acidosis.  Hemodialysis will commense today.
   4)       Coma
 Exact cause of abnl mentation still not clear, with now
   hypotension added to possible causes. I am still suspicious that uremia
   is contributing to his obtundation and CNS infection seems much less
   likely. TTP has been mentioned (thrombocytopenia, fever, renal failure,
   etc) and we
ll check his rbc smear
   5)       Thrombocytopenia
 plt ct now down to 64k. Ranitidine
   stopped.  Will follow closely
   6)       Resp Failure
 his CxR is largely unchanged and vent settings
   and ABG
s also adequate. Pt may have some central hyperventilation
   (7.50/33/63 on 50%).  His CT from [**State 395**] from [**12-22**] has been found and
   uploaded. It shows multifocal ground glass opacities and tiny right
   pleural effusion.  This pattern is non specific (alv hemorrhage,
   nonbacterial infection, pulm edema, etc) and not particularly
   suggestive of idiopathic BOOP.
   I have explained to the pt
s son that Mr [**Name (NI) 12627**] is very ill with
   multisystem organ failure. We will continue to do our best to dx and rx
   all problems, but the son states that the patient would want all this
   care only so long as we think there is a reasonable chance of his
   returning to his independent lifestyle.
   60 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, fever, and worsening renal function. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, unable to provide a history. He has a known diagnosis of coronary artery disease and has shown signs of worsening ischemia with ST depression in leads I and aVL. The patient's cardiac function has declined, and there is concern for possible cardiogenic shock. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's known history of coronary artery disease and worsening ischemia may lead to further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP may progress to severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation support.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function and hyperkalemia indicate ongoing renal dysfunction, which may require emergent hemodialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could be contributing to septic shock.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with systolic heart failure who presented to the hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia) and acute on CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, which may be due to septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Other complications include fever, respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, anemia, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and fever could indicate septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Another possibility for the patient's hypotension is cardiogenic shock, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, a severe form of lung injury characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, a PE should always be considered on the differential diagnosis.
5. Worsening Ischemia: The worsening ST depression in leads I and aVL, along with the elevated cardiac enzymes, suggest"

   Assessment and Plan:  83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from
   OSH with acute hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and
   acute on CKI.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented from an
   OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last p02 of 60 on
   FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of failure
   includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome,
   VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).
   Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to moderate
   restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were
   noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w
   BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage
   post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart failure, as evidence by TTE, is
   likely the primary component.
   - son to attempt to obtain non-cont CT chest on [**2138-12-22**], done prior to
   first bronchoscopy
   - will cont to wean methylpred to 20 mg daily tomorrow
   - f/u BAL results
   - repeat vasculitis serologies are negative
   - Klebsiella resistant only to amp, will cont cipro today day [**2-15**]
   - see below for CHF management
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
   .
   #. Chronic Systolic CHF: Pt with last known EF of 40%. TTE shows slight
   decline in systolic function with clear volume overload. Now appears to
   be clinically hypervolemic.
   - cont lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 4 liters today
   - cont afterload reduction with isosorbide, avoiding ACEi given renal
   fxn, avoiding B blockade given 1^st degree heart block
   .
   # CAD s/p angioplasty, stent x 1:  troponin elevated, CK and MB
   normal.  Given recent history of hemoptysis and possible RML
   hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, and no significant ECG changes from
   admission to OSH, will defer anti-platelet and anti-coagulation at this
   time.  Will continue to trend and continue ASA 325 mg daily.  Repeat
   ECG unchanged yesterday.
   - hold statin in setting of transaminitis
   - troponin stable, will stop trending
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: DDx includes prerenal azotemia (poor
   forward flow, intravascular depletion), intrinsic. Although now with
   signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis,
   hyperkalemia to sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may
   require HD vs CVVH given azotemia.  Steroid-induced catabolic state
   likely etiology of elevated BUN.  Creatinine stable at 2 and unchanged
   from [**2139-1-5**].
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins

   # Altered Mental Status- Patient has not been alert/interactive since
   transfer.  Sedation held for period of time yesterday, without
   improvement.  No clonus on exam, although significant uremia likely
   contributing to altered mental status.
   - will attempt daily awakenings, hold sedation
   - pt may need additional eval tomorrow if no improvement, e.g. further
   imaging, LP, EEG, etc

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's last pulmonary function tests showed a mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect. Autoantibodies such as ANCA were negative. Path report confirmed BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). Imaging from the outside hospital shows clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. The patient's systolic heart failure is likely the primary component. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension (shock), respiratory failure (not ARDS), coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (CHF), renal failure (acute), hyperkalemia, anemia, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, and altered mental status.

Plan:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's FiO2 has been increased to 50%. Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis, VAP, and obstructive lung disease. Path report confirms BOOP. Imaging shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. Systolic heart failure is likely the primary component. Non-cont CT chest will be obtained, and methylprednisolone will be weaned to 20 mg daily tomorrow.

2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a last known"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and renal failure. The patient presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. Initial assessment revealed signs of wakefulness but the patient was not following commands. Free water deficit was corrected by administering free water boluses and discontinuing lasix. Sodium levels were corrected and free water boluses were decreased, with the restart of lasix. The patient experienced hypotension overnight, and the transition from levo to dopa was made. 

Key Findings:
- EKG showed worsening ST depression in leads I and aVL.
- Blood cultures were obtained.
- Bronchoalveolar lavage gram stain revealed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms seen.
- Respiratory culture showed no growth.
- Immunofluorescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative.
- Viral culture is pending for cytomegalovirus.
- Various laboratory values indicate abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated troponin T level, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI.
   Course complicated by hypotension.
 ? Cardiogenic SHOCK  -  Persistently low central venous oxygen
   saturation certainly suggests low cardiac output.   Cardiac enzymes are
   rather confusing, however the fact that the troponins have peaked
   before the CKs, and that the MB fraction is essentially negative likely
   suggests a past cardiac event of uncertain age given ARF, with current
   muscular hypoperfusion in the setting of known PVD.  Given fever,
   infection vs. anemia leading to demand ischemia in past is most likely
   scenario.  See below for fever eval.  Would continue dopamine given
   myocardial ischemia.  Will not start heparin as ischemia likely demand
   and would likely be exacerbated by bleeding.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30
   - Continue Dopamine
   - Trend lactate, Cardiac Enzymes, CVO2
   - ?vigileo to assess stroke volume
   - pan culture, start vanc/zosyn empirically, see below
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Patient has not been
   alert/interactive since transfer.  Currently off sedation, would await
   correction of uremia before undertaking any more invasive diagnostic
   endeavors.
   - will attempt daily awakenings, hold sedation
   .
   GI Bleed
 likely upper given coffee grounds and melena clinically.  GI
   has been consulted but I doubt they would scope him in his current
   condition.  Bright red blood has never been expressed on NG lavage.
   - GI RECS
   - DDAVP to address oozing
   - 2 units platelets
   .
   > ANEMIA/thrombocytopenia
 no evidence of hemolysis.  Pt does have
   progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets.  Bumped
   appropriately to 4 units.  While no evidence of hemolysis on smear or
   labs, patient has thrombocytopenia, fever, altered mental status, and
   renal faillure.  Still unlikely to be TTP.
   -Transfuse for HCT>30, PLT>50 given GI bleeding
   - Ferritin elevated, inconsistent with iron deficiency anemia
   .
   > FEVER
 etiology includes VAP, bacteremia from lines; abdominal
   infection, CNS infection less likely
   - will pan-culture, start zosyn/vanc empirically
   - if PICC line looks like source, will remove, re-site
   - treat fever for transfusion
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last
   p02 of 60 on FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of
   failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's
   syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from
   OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to
   moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **],
   ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat here.  Path
   report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML
   hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart failure, as evidence by
   TTE, is likely the primary component.
   - will upload CT from [**2138-12-22**]
   - steroids increased to pulse dose
   - f/u BAL results, (-) thus far
   - repeat vasculitis serologies are negative
   - Klebsiella resistant only to amp, will cont cipro today day [**4-15**]
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
   - wean vent
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation.  Cont ASA, defer anticoagulation given recent pulmonary
   hemorrhage and uremia.  EKG looked closer to baseline.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - cont dopamine
   - cont ASA
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. Although now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.
   Steroid-induced catabolic state combined with GI bleed likely etiology
   of elevated BUN.  Creatinine and urine output worsening in setting of
   hypotension and possible cardiogenic vs. septic shock.  Hyperkalemia
   progressing.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a complex medical history. He presented with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and fever.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including systolic heart failure, respiratory failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, and acute renal failure. There is also a mention of coronary artery disease (CAD) with evidence of worsening ischemia and CK/Troponin elevation.

The patient's current medications include dopamine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
- Blood Pressure: 152/78 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 98 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 32 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies show evidence of clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.

The patient's plan of care includes transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above 30 g/dL and platelet count above"

   Course complicated by hypotension.
 ? Cardiogenic SHOCK  -  Persistently low central venous oxygen
   saturation certainly suggests low cardiac output.   Cardiac enzymes are
   rather confusing, however the fact that the troponins have peaked
   before the CKs, and that the MB fraction is essentially negative likely
   suggests a past cardiac event of uncertain age given ARF, with current
   muscular hypoperfusion in the setting of known PVD.  Given fever,
   infection vs. anemia leading to demand ischemia in past is most likely
   scenario.  See below for fever eval.  Would continue dopamine given
   myocardial ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from the outside hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient has also shown signs of acute kidney injury, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's cardiac enzymes are confusing, but it appears to be a past cardiac event of uncertain age. There is evidence of myocardial ischemia and known peripheral vascular disease. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low central venous oxygen saturation suggests low cardiac output, indicating cardiogenic shock. This is supported by the presence of systolic heart failure and myocardial ischemia.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP. There are several differential diagnoses for respiratory failure, including CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and obstructive lung disease. However, the most likely cause appears to be systolic heart failure, as evidenced by the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with elevated BUN and creatinine levels. Prerenal azotemia is a possibility due to"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 12627**] and reviewed the events of the last
   24hr along with his lab and imaging data. I was present for the key
   portions of the services provided and have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11097**]
s note
   above.  I agree with his findings and plan of care.
   As noted in my note from [**1-25**], the pt remains very critically ill with
   multiorgan system failure, including resp failure, renal failure, coma,
   UGI bleeding, hypotension, and cardiac ischemia.  We are continuing
   aggressive medical interventions, including:
   1)       resp failure: continuing mech vent support, now with A/C with
   increased VT to help with air hunger. He
s now been ventilated for
   approx 3 wks. No evidence of new resp infection
   2)       GI bleed: now on IV PPI and has gotten plts and DDAVP. Heparin
   for cardiac status has been avoided, given his bleeding.  GI aware of
   pt but would not EGD unless evidence of ongoing bleeding. In retrospect
   his GI bleeding may have been contributing to rising BUN.
   3)       Hypotension: likely due to cardiac ischemia, poor LVEF, and GI
   bleed in the setting of continuous HD. Actually his dopamine
   requirement is lower today and SBP 120, and perhaps we can wean Dopa
   off.
   4)       Anemia: got 4 units rbc yesterday and will continue to support
   for Hct less than 30.
   5)       Thrombocytopenia: Unclear why plts are so low. Stopped
   ranitidine yesterday. He
s not been on heparin. Will support for plts
   under 50k
   6)       Renal failure: Getting continuous CVVHD and BUN decreasing,
   HCO stable, but so far no improvement in mental status
   7)       Fever, leukocytosis: WBC up to 33k from 24k of past few days.
   Being covered broadly with zosyn and vanc pending culture results
   8)       Unresponsiveness: This is a crucial issue to family.  Dialysis
   ongoing to see if any improvement in mentation as BUN gets below 90 and
   SBP remains over 100. CT just last week showed no cause for current
   obtundation.  If other organ systems improve and mentation doesn
   further neuro assessment may be in order.
   9)       Family communication and pt wishes: I
ve spoken to son [**Name (NI) 453**]
   and daughter [**Name (NI) 4097**] at some length and have explained the gravity of
   Mr [**Known lastname 12627**]
 current multiorgan system failure predicament. I have asked
   them to consider DNR status, given the lack of likely effectiveness of
   CPR in this settting. They will discuss this and get back to team. I
   also told them that this is a very unstable situation and that unless
   several things improve quickly, such as in the next couple of days, I
   didn
t see how Mr [**Known lastname 12627**] could survive all these insults, especially
   given his severe CAD

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with evidence of ischemia.

The patient's current condition includes multiorgan system failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, coma, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and cardiac ischemia. The patient is critically ill and requires aggressive medical interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and has been ventilated for approximately three weeks. There is no evidence of new respiratory infection, but the patient remains critically ill with respiratory failure.

2. GI bleeding: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which may have contributed to the rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient is receiving intravenous pantoprazole and has received platelets and DDAVP. The decision to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will depend on the presence of ongoing bleeding.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiac ischemia, poor left ventricular ejection fraction, and gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of continuous hemodialysis. The patient's dopamine requirement is lower today, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI.
   Course complicated by hypotension.
 ? Cardiogenic SHOCK  -  Persistently low central venous oxygen
   saturation certainly suggests low cardiac output.   Cardiac enzymes are
   rather confusing, however the fact that the troponins have peaked
   before the CKs, and that the MB fraction is essentially negative likely
   suggests a past cardiac event of uncertain age given ARF, with current
   muscular hypoperfusion.  PE always on the differential.  Given fever,
   favor infection leading to demand ischemia.  See below for fever eval.
   Will continue dopamine given myocardial ischemia.
   - two units PRBCs, IVF boluses for SBP > 110
   - pan culture, start vanc/zosyn empirically, see below
   - will check mixed venous O2 sat to differentiate septic shock vs.
   cardiogenic shock
   .
   GI Bleed
 likely upper given coffee grounds and melena clinically.  GI
   has been consulted but I doubt they would scope him in his current
   condition.  Bright red blood has never been expressed on NG lavage.
   -
   .
   > ANEMIA
 no evidence of hemolysis.  Pt does have progressive
   thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets.  2 units of PRBCs as above.
   Consider non-con CT torso if inappropriate bump.
   > FEVER
 etiology includes VAP, bacteremia from lines; abdominal
   infection, CNS infection less likely
   - will pan-culture, start zosyn/vanc empirically
   - if PICC line looks like source, will remove, re-site
   - treat fever for transfusion
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last
   p02 of 60 on FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of
   failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's
   syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from
   OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to
   moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **],
   ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat here.  Path
   report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML
   hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart failure, as evidence by
   TTE, is likely the primary component.
   - will upload CT from [**2138-12-22**]
   - will increase steroids to pulse dose
   - f/u BAL results, (-) thus far
   - repeat vasculitis serologies are negative
   - Klebsiella resistant only to amp, will cont cipro today day [**3-15**]
   - see below for CHF management
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation.  Cont ASA, defer anticoagulation given recent pulmonary
   hemorrhage and uremia.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - cont dopamine
   - cont ASA
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, [**Name (NI) 12685**] Pt with last known EF of 40%.
   Repeat TTE shows slight decline in systolic function with clear volume
   overload. Now appears to be clinically hypervolemic  Concern for
   worsening systolic fxn and possible pericardial effusion/tamponade.
   - cont lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 4 liters today
   - cont afterload reduction with isosorbide, avoiding ACEi given renal
   fxn, avoiding B blockade given 1^st degree heart block
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. Although now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.
   Steroid-induced catabolic state likely etiology of elevated BUN.
   Creatinine and urine output worsening in setting of hypotension and
   possible cardiogenic vs. septic shock.  Hyperkalemia progressing.

   yesterday, without improvement.  No clonus on exam, although
   significant uremia likely contributing to altered mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI.
   Course complicated by hypotension.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)  -  Differential includes septic shock,
   cardiogenic.  Less likely hypovolemic.  PE always on the differential.
   Given fever, favor infection leading to demand ischemia.  See below for
   fever eval.  Will continue dopamine given myocardial ischemia.
   - two units PRBCs, IVF boluses for SBP > 110
   - pan culture, start vanc/zosyn empirically, see below
   - will check mixed venous O2 sat to differentiate septic shock vs.
   cardiogenic shock
   .
   GI Bleed
 likely upper given coffee grounds and melena clinically.  GI
   has been consulted but I doubt they would scope him in his current
   condition.  Bright red blood has never been expressed on NG lavage.
   -
   .
   > ANEMIA
 no evidence of hemolysis.  Pt does have progressive
   thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets.  2 units of PRBCs as above.
   Consider non-con CT torso if inappropriate bump.
   > FEVER
 etiology includes VAP, bacteremia from lines; abdominal
   infection, CNS infection less likely
   - will pan-culture, start zosyn/vanc empirically
   - if PICC line looks like source, will remove, re-site
   - treat fever for transfusion
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02. Last
   p02 of 60 on FiO2, PEEP 10.  Increased FiO2 to 50%.  Differential of
   failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's
   syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT chest from
   OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with mild to
   moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **],
   ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat here.  Path
   report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML
   hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart failure, as evidence by
   TTE, is likely the primary component.
   - will upload CT from [**2138-12-22**]

   - cont lasix gtt this morning, goal (-) 2 to 4 liters today
   - cont afterload reduction with isosorbide, avoiding ACEi given renal
   fxn, avoiding B blockade given 1^st degree heart block
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. Although now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.
   Steroid-induced catabolic state likely etiology of elevated BUN.
   Creatinine and urine output worsening in setting of hypotension and

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure. He presented to the hospital with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, likely due to septic shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, indicated by coffee grounds on NG lavage and positive guaiac test. Other medical complications include anemia, fever, respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 152/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion for myocardial ischemia, pantoprazole drip for GI protection, and other medications for various conditions.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine levels, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically.

The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by an increasing BUN and creatinine levels, along with"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Patient has not been
   alert/interactive since transfer.  Currently off sedation x several
   days. Ddx includes uremia, infectious (nosocomial meningitis), CVA
   (although CT nl), nonconvulsive status, anoxic brain injury [**2-10**]
   hypoperfusion, or poor sedative clearance in setting of liver
   dysnfunction . BUN now <100 and no change in mental status.

   meningitis
   - cont to maintain MAP>65 for cerebral perfusion
   - will attempt daily awakenings, hold sedation
   .
 ? Cardiogenic SHOCK  -  Persistently low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggests inadequate cardiac output.  Chest imaging suggests
   CHF. Vigeleo readings suggest normal to high SV and CO, which may have
   been due to effects of dopamine or patient may be requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE, getting repeat today. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of
   fever and anemia, now CE trending down. Thrombosis less likely given pt
   has coagulopathy and several reasons for demand at time of trop leak.
   Heparin contraindicated in setting of GI bleed.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - f/u repeat TTE read

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology.
   - pt has air hunger and mild dysynchrony, became alkalotic when VT
   increased, but holding off sedation for mental status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with systolic heart failure who presented with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia), and acute on CKI (chronic kidney injury). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding, and multiorgan failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has low central venous oxygen saturation, suggesting inadequate cardiac output. Imaging suggests CHF (congestive heart failure), and Vigeleo readings indicate normal to high SV (stroke volume) and CO (cardiac output). The patient also has a history of demand ischemia, fever, and anemia, making thrombosis less likely. Heparin is contraindicated due to GI bleed. 

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute, Hypoxemic: The patient presented with a vent setting of 10 PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) and 40% FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen). Differential diagnosis includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome), VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), and obstructive lung disease. Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML (right middle lobe) hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. The current process is multifactorial, including pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP, and underlying COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

3. GI Bleed: The patient has a likely upper GI bleed, evidenced by coffee grounds in the orogastric tube. Hct (hematocrit) has only increased by 1 point after 1 U (unit) of PRBCs (packed red blood cells). 

4. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets and appears to have a consumptive process since losing transfused plts (platelets) rapidly. PT and PTT (partial thromboplastin time) are prolonged, but fibrinogen levels are normal. There is suspicion of low-level DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation).

5. Bacteremia: Blood culture from [**1-25**] (off A-line) is growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is concerning for line source. The patient is afebrile, and WBC (white blood cell) count is trending down. Will monitor with current lines in place given suspicion for contamination rather than infection.

6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD/Ischemic Heart Disease): There is evidence of worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL, and worsening CK (creatine kinase), troponin elevation. The patient is not anticoagulated, holding ASA (aspirin), due to GI bleed.

7. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF):"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
 ? Cardiogenic SHOCK  -  Persistently low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggests low cardiac output.  Chest imaging suggests CHF.
   Vigeleo readings suggest normal to high SV and CO, which may have been
   due to effects of dopamine. It is highly unlikely that these represent
   true normal values given depressed LVEF 30-35% on TTE and picture c/w
   cardiogenic shock. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever
   and anemia, now CE trending down. Thrombosis less likely given pt has
   coagulopathy and several reasons for demand at time of trop leak.
   Heparin contraindicated in setting of GI bleed.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30
   - Continue Dopamine
   - Trend lactate, Cardiac Enzymes, CVO2
   - ?vigileo to assess stroke volume
   - pan culture, start vanc/zosyn empirically, see below
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Systolic heart failure, as evidence
   by TTE, is likely the primary component, on top of underlying COPD and
   poor reserve.
   - pt has air hunger, became alkalotic when VT increased
   - cont pulse dose steroids
   - f/u BAL results, (-) thus far
   - repeat vasculitis serologies are negative
   - Klebsiella resistant only to amp, will cont cipro today day [**5-15**]
   - attempt to obtain path slide for additional review
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Patient has not been
   alert/interactive since transfer.  Currently off sedation x several
   days. Ddx includes uremia, infectious, CVA (although CT nl), anoxic
   brain injury [**2-10**] hypoperfusion . BUN now <100 and no change.
   - cont CVVH, BUN trending down
   - cont to maintain MAP>65 for cerebral perfusion
   - will attempt daily awakenings, hold sedation

   GI Bleed
 likely upper given coffee grounds, now becoming more brisk
   with hematochezia replacing melena.  GI did not see him since they
   would not offer endoscopy.
   - cont PPI ggt
   - repeat DDAVP
   - transfuse plts for goal >50, blood for Hct>30

 no evidence of hemolysis, retic count low.
   Pt does have progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets, and
   appears to have consumptive process since losing transfused plts
   rapidly. PT and PTT prolonged. Fibrinogen nl but is acute phase
   reactant. [**Month (only) 51**] have low level DIC.
   - monitor q6 DIC labs and replete FFP/cryo if needed
   .
   > BACTEREMIA:

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).  We
   are continuing aggressive medical interventions, including:
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Development of renal
   failure suggest pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's,
   HUS).  Now multifactorial (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD,
   CHF, underlying COPD).  Continue steroids, antimicrobials, and
   mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider tracheostomy if no contined
   progress, but family considering long-term options (may not desire
   tracheotomy).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  [**Month (only) 51**] need to d/c intravascular catheters.  Plan
   continue antimicrobials (Vanco, Zosyn).
   FEVER -- now attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor fever.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to sepsis, and in part to acute blood
   loss, perhaps component of adrenal insufficiency.  Currently improved.
   CAD -- now evicence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac meds.  Plan check cardiac echo.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH.
   ANEMIA -- multifctorial.  Now evidence for blood loss.  Monitor serial
   Hct, transfuse if Hct < .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  Monitor.
   COMA -- persistent.  Attributed in part to possible anoxic brain
   injury, uremia and medications.  Evaluation unrevealing to date (head
   CT).  Check EEG, consider head MRI and LP.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male who was initially admitted with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. He now presents with multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 160/42 to 163/63 mmHg, respiratory rate between 24-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 530-600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and neurologic examination showing sedation but purposeful movements. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (26.7 K/uL), hemoglobin (10.4 g/dL), creatinine (2.0 mg/dL), and lactate (2.2 mmol/L). The patient also has thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 77), elevated troponin T (0.89 ng/mL), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST 3436/1633).

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).  We
   are continuing aggressive medical interventions, including:
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Development of renal
   failure suggest pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's,
   HUS).  Now multifactorial (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD,
   CHF, underlying COPD).  Continue steroids, antimicrobials, and
   mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider tracheostomy if no contined
   progress, but family considering long-term options (may not desire
   tracheotomy).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  [**Month (only) 51**] need to d/c intravascular catheters.  Plan
   continue antimicrobials (Vanco, Zosyn).
   FEVER -- now attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor fever.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to sepsis, and in part to acute blood
   loss, perhaps component of adrenal insufficiency.  Currently improved.
   CAD -- now evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac meds.  Plan check cardiac echo.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH.
   ANEMIA -- multifctorial.  Now evidence for blood loss.  Monitor serial
   Hct, transfuse if Hct < .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  Monitor.
   COMA -- persistent.  Attributed in part to possible anoxic brain
   injury, uremia and medications.  Evaluation unrevealing to date (head
   CT).  Check EEG, consider head MRI and LP.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male who was initially experiencing respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. He now presents with multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been receiving aggressive medical interventions, including steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has limited progress in respiratory failure, with unclear etiology for infiltrates. This suggests the possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's, HUS). There are also other factors contributing to respiratory failure, such as diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

2. Bacteremia: GPC in blood culture, likely line-related (PICC, a-line, dialysis catheter). The plan is to continue antimicrobials (Vanco, Zosyn).

3. Fever: Now attributed in part to bacteremia. Monitor fever.

4. Hypotension: Attributed in part to sepsis and in part to acute blood loss, perhaps component of adrenal insufficiency. Currently improved.

5. CAD: Now evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand ischemia. Monitor serial cardiac meds. Plan check cardiac echo.

6. Melena/Hematochezia: Unc"

   altered mental.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Patient seemed to open his eyes
   to his name yesterday which is a significant change.  We will continue
   off sedation x several days.  Poor hepatic clearance of sedatives vs
   delirium vs uremia are highest on the differential.
   - cont CVVH, BUN trending down

   streaked melena.  GI did not see him since they would not offer
   endoscopy. Transfuse to 30, ddavp, pplts.
   - Formal GI consult
   .
 ? Cardiogenic SHOCK  -  At this point at least the shock aspect
   appears resolved.  Persistently low central venous oxygen saturation
   suggests inadequate cardiac output.  Chest imaging suggests CHF.
   Vigeleo readings suggest normal to high SV and CO, which may have been
   due to effects of dopamine or patient may be requiring higher cardiac
   output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on TTE,
   getting repeat today. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of
   fever and anemia, now CE trending down. Thrombosis less likely given pt
   has coagulopathy and several reasons for demand at time of trop leak.
   Heparin contraindicated in setting of GI bleed.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - TTE shows biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology.
   - pt has air hunger and mild dysynchrony, became alkalotic when VT
   increased, but holding off sedation for mental status
   - cont pulse dose steroids since BP decreased with weaning, reassess if
   BPs stable off pressors x 24 hours
   - f/u BAL results (-)

   > ANEMIA/thrombocytopenia
 no evidence of hemolysis, retic count low.
   Pt does have progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets, and
   appears to have consumptive process since losing transfused plts
   rapidly. PT and PTT prolonged. Fibrinogen nl but is acute phase
   reactant. [**Month (only) 51**] have low level DIC.
   - monitor q8 DIC labs and CBC and replete FFP/cryo if needed

   hemorrhage and uremia.  EKG looked closer to baseline. Pt not on statin
   at baseline and not candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not
   anticoagulated, holding ASA, due to GI bleed.
   - weaned off dopamine yesterday
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. Although now with signs of fluid overload, BUN of 200.
   Steroid-induced catabolic state combined with GI bleed likely etiology
   of elevated BUN.  Creatinine and urine output worsening in setting of
   hypotension and possible cardiogenic vs. septic shock.  Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs. Started on CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH with aggressive diuresis as tolerated by BPS
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   #. ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS: Pt has LFTs c/w ischemic injury, transaminases
   now trending down and bili peaking.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown signs of opening his eyes to his name, indicating a possible change in mental status. This could be due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives, delirium, or uremia.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient continues to have blood streaked melena, suggesting ongoing GI bleeding. It is important to continue transfusing the patient and administering DDAVP and platelets to manage the bleeding.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which appeared to be resolved. However, the persistently low central venous oxygen saturation suggests inadequate cardiac output. The patient's ejection fraction is 30-35%, and there is evidence of biventricular dysfunction. It is important to maintain a good mean arterial pressure (MAP) and optimize cardiac output.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as congestive heart failure, ANCA-associated vasculitis, ventil"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).  We
   are continuing aggressive medical interventions, including:
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Development of renal
   failure suggest pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's,
   HUS).  Now multifactorial (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD,
   CHF, underlying COPD).  Continue steroids --> taper, continue
   antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, but family considering long-term
   options (may not desire tracheotomy).
   COMA -- persistent.  Attributed in part to possible anoxic brain
   injury, uremia and medications.  Evaluation unrevealing to date (head
   CT).  Await EEG [**Location (un) **], consider head MRI (and possible LP).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  [**Month (only) 51**] need to d/c intravascular catheters.  Plan
   continue antimicrobials (Vanco, Zosyn).  Await final identification.
   FEVER -- now attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor temperature.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to sepsis, and in part to acute blood
   loss, perhaps component of adrenal insufficiency.  Currently improved.
   CAD -- now evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac meds.  Plan check cardiac echo.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 25 .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  Monitor.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Resolving.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male who was admitted with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. He has now developed multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is being managed with aggressive medical interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has diffuse infiltrates and limited progress in respiratory function. There is a concern for pulmonary-renal syndrome, such as anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's, or HUS. Multifactorial causes like diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, and underlying COPD should also be considered. Continuing steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation is planned. A tracheostomy may be considered if there is no continued progress.

2. Coma: The patient remains in a persistent coma, which could be attributed to possible anoxic brain injury, uremia, and medications. An evaluation has been unrevealing to date (head CT), and an EEG and possible head MRI are pending. 

3. Bacteremia: The patient has GPC in blood culture, likely line-related. It is planned to continue antimicrobials (Vanco, Zosyn) and remove intravascular catheters. 

4. Fever: The patient's fever is now attributed in part to bacteremia. Monitoring temperature is important.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).  We
   are continuing aggressive medical interventions, including:
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Development of renal
   failure suggest pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's,
   HUS).  Now multifactorial (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD,
   CHF, underlying COPD).  Continue steroids --> taper, continue
   antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, but family considering long-term
   options (may not desire tracheotomy).
   COMA -- persistent.  Attributed in part to possible anoxic brain
   injury, uremia and medications.  Evaluation unrevealing to date (head
   CT).  Await EEG [**Location (un) **], consider head MRI (and possible LP).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  [**Month (only) 51**] need to d/c intravascular catheters.  Plan
   continue antimicrobials (Vanco, Zosyn).  Await final identification.
   FEVER -- now attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor temperature.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to sepsis, and in part to acute blood
   loss, perhaps component of adrenal insufficiency.  Currently improved.
   CAD -- now evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac meds.  Plan check cardiac echo.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 25 .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  Monitor.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Resolving.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male who initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. He now has multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on aggressive medical interventions, including mechanical ventilation, steroids, antimicrobials, and hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's, HUS): The development of renal failure suggests the possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome. This condition involves inflammation of both the lungs and kidneys and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Diffuse pulmonary disease: The patient's diffuse infiltrates on imaging may indicate a widespread lung condition such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These conditions can compromise oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has evidence of myocardial damage, which may suggest ischemic heart disease or a heart attack. This increases the risk of arrhythmias, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena and hematochezia indicates bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This could be due to peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, or other causes. If not identified and managed promptly, it can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
5. Infection-related complications: The patient"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation x several days.  Poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives vs delirium vs uremia are highest on the differential.
   - cont CVVH likely [**1-10**] more days until BUN in 20
s and reassess
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - f/u MRI read
   - Continue meropenem for small possibility of nosocomial bacterial
   meningitis
   - cont to maintain MAP>65 for cerebral perfusion
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is improving gradually but still has altered mental status, which could be due to delirium, poor hepatic clearance of sedatives, or uremia. It will be important to continue monitoring the patient's mental status and reassessing the differential diagnosis.

2. Respiratory failure, acute, hypoxemic: The patient presented with acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and obstructive lung disease. The patient's imaging from the outside hospital showed clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy, indicating a multifactorial process involving pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP, and underlying COPD with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

3. GI bleed: The patient likely has an upper gastrointestinal bleed, as evidenced by coffee grounds and blood-streaked melena. The bleeding is ongoing,"

","Summary:
- The patient has a chief complaint of epilepsy, with EEG equipment currently non-functional.
- The arterial line was stopped at 02:25 AM.
- The patient underwent an MRI of the head.
- The patient has allergies to no known drugs.
- The patient received various antibiotics, including Piperacillin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, and Meropenem.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 123/66 mmHg to 128/69 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.
- The patient is being mechanically ventilated with a volume control mode, set tidal volume of 530 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous breaths allowed.
- The patient's ABG results show pH 7.55, PaCO2 35 mmHg, HCO3- 71 mEq/L, PO2 142, and SaO2 100%.
- The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 27.9 g/dL, platelet count of 67 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 73 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.48 mg/dL.
- The patient has several medical complications, including bacteremia, acute thrombocytopenia, upper gastrointestinal bleed, acute respiratory failure, chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, indicating a possible infection in the bloodstream.
2. Bleeding: The patient has upper gastrointestinal bleeding and other gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and complications.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may require further interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiac problems: The patient has chronic heart failure and ischemic heart disease, which can result in decreased cardiac output and complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal issues: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can cause neurological symptoms and complications if not managed properly.
7. Diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which requires careful management of blood glucose levels to prevent complications.
8. Peripheral vascular disease: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).  We
   are continuing aggressive medical interventions, including:
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Development of renal
   failure suggest pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's,
   HUS).  Now multifactorial (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD,
   CHF, underlying COPD).  Continue steroids --> taper, continue
   antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, but family considering long-term
   options (may not desire tracheotomy).
   COMA -- Demonstrating gradual improvement.  Attributed in part to
   uremia, slow clearance of sedating medications, and possible anoxic
   brain injury (less likely).  Evaluation unrevealing to date (head CT).
   Await EEG [**Location (un) **], consider head MRI (and possible LP).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   FEVER -- Attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor temperature.
   HYPOTENSION --  Currently improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   CAD -- now evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac meds.  Plan check cardiac echo.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient appears more awake and attentive, but still sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has a history of diffuse infiltrates, multisystem organ failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now gastrointestinal bleeding. The etiology for the infiltrates is unclear, but could be due to pulmonary-renal syndrome or other factors such as CAD, CHF, and underlying COPD. The patient's coma is attributed to uremia, slow clearance of sedating medications, and possible anoxic brain injury. There is a likelihood of line-related bacteremia and an unclear source of melena/haematemesis. The patient has hypotension, renal failure, anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's disposition is DNR (do not resuscitate) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing respiratory distress with diffuse infiltrates and is currently on mechanical ventilation. This indicates a severe lung condition that may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Multisystem Organ Failure: The patient has evidence of failure in multiple organ systems including the kidneys, heart, liver, and gastrointestinal system. This increases the risk of further organ dysfunction and failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).  We
   are continuing aggressive medical interventions, including:
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Development of renal
   failure suggest pulmonary-renal syndrome (anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's,
   HUS).  Now multifactorial (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD,
   CHF, underlying COPD).  Continue steroids --> taper, continue
   antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, but family considering long-term
   options (may not desire tracheotomy).
   COMA -- Demonstrating gradual improvement.  Attributed in part to
   uremia, slow clearance of sedating medications, and possible anoxic
   brain injury (less likely).  Evaluation unrevealing to date (head CT).
   Await EEG [**Location (un) **], consider head MRI (and possible LP).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   FEVER -- Attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor temperature.
   HYPOTENSION --  Currently improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   CAD -- now evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac meds.  Plan check cardiac echo.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH --> consider
   holdinig CVVH to evaluate intrinsic renal function.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 25 .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to active GI bleed (consumption).  Monitor.
   Consider Hematology consultation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male who was initially admitted with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. The patient now presents with multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with limited progress despite aggressive medical interventions. There is an unclear etiology for the infiltrates, and the development of renal failure suggests pulmonary-renal syndrome or other underlying conditions such as anti-GBM syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, or HUS. Multifactorial causes including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been considered.

2. Coma: The patient demonstrates gradual improvement in consciousness, attributed to uremia, slow clearance of sedating medications, and possible anoxic brain injury. Further evaluation with EEG and head MRI or LP may be considered to determine the cause of the coma.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has GPC in the blood culture, likely line-related. The plan is to continue antimicrobials to full course, and the problematic line has been discontinued.

4. Fever: The fever is attributed in part to bacteremia and will be monitored.

5. Hypotension: The patient"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation x several days.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic
   clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   - cont CVVH likely [**1-10**] more days until BUN in 20
s and reassess
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - f/u MRI read
   - consider D/C meropenem if course for Klebsiella complete since very
   low suspicion of nosocomial bacterial meningitis
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology.
   - PSV trial now that mental status improved
   - follow VBGs and ABGs prn
   - wean steroids
   .
   GI Bleed
 likely upper given coffee grounds, today coffee grounds
   resolved and residual melena but no bright red blood.
   - apprecaite GI recs
   - cont [**Hospital1 7**] pantoprazole
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, and appears to have consumptive process since losing
   transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now normalized. Fibrinogen nl.
   - transfuse to goal 10
   - send HIT and serotonin assay
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - heme consult
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - TTE shows biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion
   - off Dopamine maintaining good pressures, goal MAP>65
   > BACTEREMIA:

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not anticoagulated, holding
   ASA, due to GI bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Continue CVVH with goal TBB -1L today
   - appreciate renal recs

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting from outside hospital (OSH) with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP. There is also a mention of potential pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had coffee grounds emesis and melena, suggesting upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a mention of a possible consumptive process leading to thrombocytopenia.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets and appears to have a consumptive process. The platelet count is rapidly decreasing despite transfusion, indicating ongoing platelet consumption.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has evidence of worsening ischemia and elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old male with a complex medical history presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications including bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's mental status has improved gradually, and the cause of altered mental status is likely due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia.

The patient has experienced thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets and a consumptive process, possibly related to GI bleeding. The cause of the thrombocytopenia may be pantoprazole or another medication.

The patient's hypotension was initially due to inadequate cardiac output but resolved after optimizing fluid management and cardiac support. The patient has evidence of worsening ischemia and an elevated troponin level, indicating ongoing myocardial ischemia.

The patient has acute renal failure, and the differential diagnosis includes prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal failure, and postrenal obstruction. The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

The patient also has evidence of ischemic hepatitis with elevated liver enzymes, which are"

","The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and various other complications such as bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleed, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and liver dysfunction. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen. They are also receiving CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) due to acute renal failure. The patient has a history of chronic conditions like COPD and coronary artery disease. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, progression of coronary artery disease, and ongoing hepatic dysfunction. The patient's altered mental status may be due to uremia and hepatic clearance of sedatives. The patient is also at risk for infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infections. Thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to increased bleeding risk. The patient's heart failure may progress, and there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock. Additionally, the patient may develop further complications related to their multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, renal, cardiac, and hepatic functions. Aggressive supportive care, including continued CVVH, weaning off sedatives, and optimizing blood pressure and oxygenation, is essential. The patient's family should be updated on the poor"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,

   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology.
   - cont PSV trials now that mental status improved

 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver.

   candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not anticoagulated, holding
   ASA, due to GI bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - will need to restart anti-platelet therapy when GI bleed resolves
   - recheck ECG this morning

   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, which is characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood despite adequate ventilation. This condition is likely multifactorial, involving pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The cause of acute renal failure includes prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal damage, and potential ischemic injury to the kidneys.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has experienced progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic platelets and a consumptive process. This could be due to pantoprazole therapy or a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) process. Further evaluation is needed, including HIT and serotonin assays.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): There is evidence of worsening ischemia in leads I and aVL, as well as elevated cardiac markers (CK, troponin). The patient is not a candidate for statin therapy at this time due to shock liver and is not anticoagulated due to the risk of gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. They had completed an antibiotic course and were weaned off steroids. The patient continued on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). Allergies were obtained from hospital records. The last doses of antibiotics were given on 01/28/2139 at 08:11 AM (Vancomycin) and 01/30/2139 at 01:15 AM (Meropenem). Infusions included insulin, potassium chloride (CRRT), and pantoprazole. Other medications were also administered.

The patient denied pain and was sedated. Review of systems revealed no changes except for the noted below. Vital signs included a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/66-127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient had a first-degree AV block, with weight recorded as 104 kg (admission weight: 105.5 kg).

Fluid balance showed total input of 7,242 mL and output of 8,732 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,490 mL. Respiratory support included CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 0 mL and spontaneous tidal volume of 611-738 mL. Oxygen delivery was via an endotr"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.

   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, and appears to have consumptive process since losing
   transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now normalized. Fibrinogen nl.
   Pantoprazole could be etiology.
   - transfuse to goal 10, 50 if increased bleeding
   - send HIT and serotonin assay
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - heme consult, appreciate recs -> ? etiology

   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding ->
   gave one bag of plts this A.M. for count of 28 and increased bleeding
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute.
   - cont CVVH likely [**1-10**] more days until BUN in 20
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - will D/C meropenem on 1/26f for course of Klebsiella therapy, very
   low suspicion for nosocomial bacterial meningitis
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology.
   - cont PSV trials now that mental status improved
   - follow VBGs and ABGs prn
   - cont to wean steroids, tomorrow methylpred 20 mg IV x 1
   - will need to review OSH CT chest prior to bronch, review path to
   develop differentialy for original presentation of hemopysis -> ? pulm
   edema [**2-10**] heart failure.  Vasculitis, BOOP less likely
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - TTE shows biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion
   - off Dopamine maintaining good pressures, goal MAP>65
   - cont to trend LFTs, improving
   .
   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.
   > BACTEREMIA:
 blood cx from [**1-25**] (off A-line) growing CoNS. A-line
   D/Ced. Off vanco.
   - surveillance blood cx (-) thus far
   .
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not anticoagulated, holding
   ASA, due to GI bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - will need to restart anti-platelet therapy when GI bleed resolves
   - recheck ECG this morning
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Continue CVVH with goal TBB -1 to 2L today
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   #. ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS: Pt has LFTs c/w ischemic injury, now trending

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.
- The patient did well on a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The antibiotic course was completed on [**2-3**].
- Steroids were weaned from 60 to 40 mg daily.
- Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was continued.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient has edema in both lower extremities.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes.
- Imaging reveals an area of encephalomalacia involving the right middle cerebral artery territory consistent with a chronic infarct and areas of white matter hyperintensity likely representing the sequela of chronic microangiopathy.
- The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, acute gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure (not ARDS), coronary artery disease, heart failure (CHF), renal failure, and hypernatremia.
- The patient's mental status has improved gradually"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Continue steroids --> taper, continue antimicrobials, and mechanical
   ventilation.  Need to consider tracheostomy if no continued progress,
   but family considering long-term options (may not desire tracheotomy).
   COMA -- Resolved.  Attributed in part to uremia, slow clearance of
   sedating medications, and possible anoxic brain injury (less likely).
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- no evidence for central CNS process.  Suspect
   critical care illness (received high dose steroids and paralytics).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.  Monitor BC.
   CAD -- recent evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac enzymes.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH --> consider
   holdinig CVVH to evaluate intrinsic renal function.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 25 .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to active GI bleed (consumption).  Monitor.
   Hematology consultation pending.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Resolving.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male who initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. The patient now exhibits signs of multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates, indicating possible pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These conditions can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or other factors. Renal failure can further complicate the patient's overall condition and may require dialysis.

3. Persistent Coma: The patient remains in a coma, which may be attributed to uremia, slow clearance of sedating medications, or possible anoxic brain injury. The cause of the coma needs further investigation to determine the appropriate management.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or fluid loss. Hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and increased risk of complications.

5. Cardiac Ischemia: There is evidence of myocardial"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infilutrates, now with
   multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).  Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Continue steroids --> taper, continue antimicrobials, and mechanical
   ventilation.  Need to consider tracheostomy if no continued progress,
   but family considering long-term options (may not desire tracheotomy).
   COMA -- Resolved.  Attributed in part to uremia, slow clearance of
   sedating medications, and possible anoxic brain injury (less likely).
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- no evidence for central CNS process.  Suspect
   critical care illness (received high dose steroids and paralytics).
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.  Monitor BC.
   CAD -- recent evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Monitor serial cardiac enzymes.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of thrombocytopenia (uremic plts).
   Maintain venous access, serial Hct, transfuse, GI consultation.
   Transfuse plts, correct coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Continue CVVH --> consider
   holdinig CVVH to evaluate intrinsic renal function.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 25 .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to mediations in part.  [**Month (only) 51**] be evolving
   DIC.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to active GI bleed (consumption).  Monitor.
   Hematology consultation pending.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Resolving.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male who initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates, now with multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Neurologically, the patient continues to demonstrate gradual improvement, particularly in mental status -- more attentive.

The patient has been receiving additional platelet transfusion due to thrombocytopenia. Intermittently requiring insulin drip for hyperglycemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, trace right lower extremity edema, and trace left lower extremity edema. The patient's neurologic examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, with purposeful movement of eyes and toes, decreased tone, and generalized diffuse profound weakness.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 39 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 34 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 157 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 104 mEq/L, total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT and AST) elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management for respiratory failure, coma, generalized weakness, bacteremia, coronary artery disease, melena/hematochezia, renal failure, anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and disposition. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, progression of renal failure, worsening of cardiac ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection due to thrombocytopenia and immunocompromised state, and hepatic dysfunction."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued CVVH today, goal (-) one to two liters
   - slow, likely lower, GI bleed continued, received 2 bags of platelets
   over course of day -> GI confirmed no intervention, no tagged RBC scan

   Heme c/s:
   We suggest:
   1. stopping all heparin products (flushes, etc.)
   2. sending serotonin- release assay to confirm HIT
   3. if current GI bleeding subsides would consider anticoagulation

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 GI thinks this is lower, as low volume BRBPR with now
   resolved coffee grounds and melena.
   - GI says they will not scope and will not do tagged red cell scan
   - cont [**Hospital1 7**] pantoprazole
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding ->
   gave one bag of plts this A.M. for count of 28 and increased bleeding
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, with ?contribution of HIT.   Appears to have consumptive
   process since losing transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now
   normalized. Fibrinogen nl.  Heparin and vanc stopped.  Pantoprazole
   could be etiology.
   - transfuse to goal 10, 50 if increased bleeding
   - send HIT and serotonin assay
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute.
   - cont CVVH likely [**1-10**] more days until BUN in 20
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - will D/C meropenem on [**2-3**] for course of Klebsiella therapy, very low
   suspicion for nosocomial bacterial meningitis
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient
   presented from an OSH with with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
   Differential of failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis e.g.
   Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung disease (noted on CT
   chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to be consistent with
   mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  Autoantibodies such
   as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are negative on repeat
   here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear
   RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology.
   - cont PSV trials now that mental status improved
 did well yesterday
   with NIF of -20, RSBI of 53 yesterday
   - follow VBGs and ABGs prn
   - cont to wean steroids, would change to home dose today.
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - TTE shows biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion
   - off Dopamine maintaining good pressures, goal MAP>65
   - cont to trend LFTs, improving
   .
   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.
   - Neuro thinks its critical care myopathy with superimposed steroid
   myopathy.
   > BACTEREMIA:
 blood cx from [**1-25**] (off A-line) growing CoNS. A-line
   D/Ced. Off vanco.
   - surveillance blood cx (-) thus far
   .
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not anticoagulated, holding
   ASA, due to GI bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - will need to restart anti-platelet therapy when GI bleed resolves
   - recheck ECG this morning
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Continue CVVH with goal TBB -1 to 2L today
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   #. ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS: Pt has LFTs c/w ischemic injury, now trending
   down
   - monitor daily
   - hold any hepatotoxic or hepatically cleared meds
   .
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 cont insulin drip
   .
   # GOALS OF CARE: Fam mtg yesterday. Fam aware of poor prognosis given

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure who presented to the hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient has ongoing lower GI bleeding, which may continue to pose a risk for further blood loss and potential hemorrhagic shock.
2. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia): The patient has tested positive for HIT antibodies, indicating a possible immune response to heparin therapy. This increases the risk of thrombotic events if heparin is not discontinued promptly.
3. Uremic platelets: The patient's chronic kidney injury may lead to uremic platelets, which can contribute to bleeding complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension suggests the possibility of recurrent low blood pressure episodes, potentially leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current treatment with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) indicates ongoing renal dysfunction, which can predispose to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued CVVH today, goal (-) one to two liters
   - slow, likely lower, GI bleed continued, received 2 bags of platelets
   over course of day -> GI confirmed no intervention, no tagged RBC scan

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Had been
   improving and requiring less and less support, however today after
   going to low level pressure support, after 30 minutes he became
   tachycardic, and tachypneic and required return to ventilatory support
   at CMV.  He also had some evidence of anxiety vs fatigue which is what
   I suspect the etiology of his tachypnea and decompensation was.  He
   rapidly recovered with no intervention making PE and Right sided MI
   unlikely.  X-ray was inconsistent with flash.
   .
    Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.
   - cont PSV trials now that mental status improved
 did well yesterday
   with NIF of -20, RSBI of 53 yesterday
   - follow VBGs and ABGs prn
   - cont to wean steroids, would change to home dose today.
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 GI thinks this is lower, as low volume BRBPR with now
   resolved coffee grounds and melena.
   - GI says they will not scope and will not do tagged red cell scan
   - cont [**Hospital1 7**] pantoprazole
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding ->
   gave one bag of plts this A.M. for count of 28 and increased bleeding
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, with ?contribution of HIT.   Appears to have consumptive
   process since losing transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now
   normalized. Fibrinogen nl.  Heparin and vanc stopped.  Pantoprazole
   could be etiology.
   - transfuse to goal 10, 50 if increased bleeding
   - send HIT and serotonin assay
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute.
   - cont CVVH likely [**1-10**] more days until BUN in 20
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - will D/C meropenem on [**2-3**] for course of Klebsiella therapy, very low
   suspicion for nosocomial bacterial meningitis
   .
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - TTE shows biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion
   - off Dopamine maintaining good pressures, goal MAP>65
   - cont to trend LFTs, improving
   .
   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.
   - Neuro thinks its critical care myopathy with superimposed steroid
   myopathy.
   > BACTEREMIA:
 blood cx from [**1-25**] (off A-line) growing CoNS. A-line
   D/Ced. Off vanco.
   - surveillance blood cx (-) thus far
   .
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not anticoagulated, holding
   ASA, due to GI bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - will need to restart anti-platelet therapy when GI bleed resolves
   - recheck ECG this morning
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Continue CVVH with goal TBB -1 to 2L today
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   #. ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS: Pt has LFTs c/w ischemic injury, now trending
   down
   - monitor daily
   - hold any hepatotoxic or hepatically cleared meds
   .
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 cont insulin drip
   .
   # GOALS OF CARE: Fam mtg yesterday. Fam aware of poor prognosis given
   multiorgan failure. Hope is that mental status improves with CVVH,
   otherwise it will be clear that patient will not return to his baseline
   and they would favor withdrawing care. Will give CVVH another day or

The patient also has evidence of a lower GI bleed, which is confirmed by GI department as low volume BRBPR with resolved coffee grounds and melena. The GI department has decided not to scope and will not perform a tagged red cell scan. The patient is being transfused for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding.

Thrombocytopenia is progressing with uremic platelets and suspected contribution of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's platelets are being rapidly lost, and PT and PTT are now normalized."

   STDs and TWIs.  CXR appears w/stable to improved R basilar infiltrate.
   Given possible HIT, could consider PE vs. demand ischemia.  Not able to
   empirically anti-coagulate given low platelets, continued GI oozing.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - TTE
   - Change to AC
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider switching back to PSV if improves and no other evidence
   of worsening instability
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
 Marked calcific CAD on imaging.  Had enzyme
   leak prior, given recurrent SOB will recheck enzymes, trend.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
 PF4 is positive, did get a heparin flush
   earlier this week, no other on-going heparin exposure.
   - No heparin, f/u serotonin release assay
   - Heme following, appreciate input
   - Transfuse platelets to >10, or >50 if active bleeding.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Very uremic on admission, improved on CVVH.
   Has some [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will attempt trial off of CVVH.  Running slightly
   negative on CVVH

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED
 Initially had coffee grounds from his NG
   tube, but has had persistent BRBPR suggesting possible lower source.
   GI does not feel C-scope or EGD are indicated, and Hct of late has been
   stable.  Possibly ischemic colitis in setting of hypotensive event last
   weekend.
   - Trend Hct q6h, transfuse for marked GIB or to Hct>30
   - No anticoagulation.
 HEART FAILURE, CHRONIC
 Markedly volume up w/mild to moderate MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] done well being run somewhat negative on CVVH, with reasonable
   cardiac output on the vigileo.
   - I/O ~ -1L/24hrs as hemodynamically tolerated
 WEAKNESS
 Marked weakness. MRI shows no evidence of an intracranial
   etiology.  Had been on high dose steroids, sedation, and briefly on
   paralytics.  Neurology consult yesterday felt this likely represented
   ICU and steroid myopathy.
   - Follow neuro exam
   - Discuss w/neurology if EMG needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute dyspnea and requires mechanical ventilation support. There are basilar and mid-lung zone infiltrates seen on chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has marked calcific CAD on imaging, suggesting significant coronary artery disease. This increases the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is concerning for thrombocytopenia. A positive PF4 assay indicates the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a prothrombotic disorder.

4. Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with very uremic levels on admission but has shown improvement with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). There is a plan to attempt a trial off CVVH soon.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient initially had coffee grounds from the NG tube, suggesting upper GI bleeding. However, there is persistent blood-tinged retching and bradycardia, suggesting possible lower GI bleeding or ongoing upper GI bleeding. Ischemic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure and acute respiratory failure. He presented to the ICU with hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and has required multiple interventions including continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), vasopressor support, and blood product transfusions. His laboratory values indicate acute kidney injury, elevated cardiac enzymes, and coagulopathy. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) puts him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has marked calcific coronary artery disease on imaging. There is a risk of recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction due to compromised coronary blood flow.

3. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient has a positive platelet factor 4 (PF4) test, indicating the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This condition can lead to a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis.

4. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and uremic symptoms. Close monitoring of renal function and continued use of CRRT may be necessary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with hypoxia and acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, hypertension, chronic heart failure, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 132/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 798 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory support indicates the need for careful monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate levels, along with elevated cardiac enzymes and liver enzymes. The presence of these abnormalities suggests ongoing systemic inflammation and potential complications such as sepsis or myocardial infarction.

The patient's imaging shows right basilar and mid-lung zone infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The positioning of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is also noted.

The assessment and plan section highlights several potential medical complications that the patient may face"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Had been
   improving and requiring less and less support, however today after
   going to low level pressure support, after 30 minutes he became
   tachycardic, and tachypneic and required return to ventilatory support
   at CMV.  He also had some evidence of anxiety vs fatigue which is what
   I suspect the etiology of his tachypnea and decompensation was.  He
   rapidly recovered with no intervention making PE and Right sided MI
   unlikely.  X-ray was inconsistent with flash.
   .
    Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.
   - cont PSV trials now that mental status improved
 did well yesterday
   with NIF of -20, RSBI of 53 yesterday
   - follow VBGs and ABGs prn
   - cont to wean steroids, would change to home dose today.
   .
   Pancytopenia
 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia, would
   continue to trend.
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 GI thinks this is lower, as low volume BRBPR with now
   resolved coffee grounds and melena.
   - GI says they will not scope and will not do tagged red cell scan
   - cont [**Hospital1 7**] pantoprazole
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, with ?contribution of HIT.   Appears to have consumptive
   process since losing transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now
   normalized. Fibrinogen nl.  Heparin and vanc stopped.  Pantoprazole
   could be etiology.
   - transfuse to goal 10, 50 if increased bleeding
   - send HIT + and serotonin assay
 pending
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute.
   - trial off CVVH
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - will D/C meropenem.
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient has been in the ICU for several weeks, with multiple complications including respiratory failure, pancytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, hypotension, and weakness.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with underlying COPD and ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. The patient has had episodes of tachycardia and tachypnea, but these were likely due to anxiety or fatigue rather than pulmonary embolism or right-sided myocardial infarction.

The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to the use of meropenem, which can cause bone marrow suppression. The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to uremic platelets and possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's platelet count is rapidly declining despite transfusion, suggesting a consumptive process.

The patient's altered mental status is improving gradually and is likely due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The patient is now answering questions, following commands, and moving lower extremities.

The patient's hypotension was initially thought to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a DNR (do not resuscitate) status. The patient experienced respiratory distress in the morning but did not become hypoxic or hypercarbic while on CMV (controlled mechanical ventilation). The patient's leukocyte count is low (WBC 2.6) along with thrombocytopenia (Plt 56), leading to the discontinuation of Meropenem due to unclear indication.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range (HR 87 bpm), stable blood pressure (BP 143/60 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (RR 21 breaths/min), and oxygen saturation at 100% (SpO2 100%). The patient's weight has decreased from 105.5 kg at admission to 95.7 kg currently.

The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl for pain management, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and midazolam (Versed) for sedation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 8,469 mL and output of 10,914 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,445 mL. The patient's urine output is 375 mL, NG output is 125 mL, and stool output is not assessed.

The patient is on controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Had been
   improving and requiring less and less support, however today after
   going to low level pressure support, after 30 minutes he became
   tachycardic, and tachypneic and required return to ventilatory support
   at CMV.  He also had some evidence of anxiety vs fatigue which is what
   I suspect the etiology of his tachypnea and decompensation was.  He
   rapidly recovered with no intervention making PE and Right sided MI
   unlikely.  X-ray was inconsistent with flash.
   .
    Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.
   - cont PSV trials now that mental status improved
 did well yesterday
   with NIF of -20, RSBI of 53 yesterday
   - follow VBGs and ABGs prn
   - cont to wean steroids, would change to home dose today.
   .
   Pancytopenia
 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia, would
   continue to trend.
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 GI thinks this is lower, as low volume BRBPR with now
   resolved coffee grounds and melena.
   - GI says they will not scope and will not do tagged red cell scan
   - cont [**Hospital1 7**] pantoprazole
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding ->
   gave one bag of plts this A.M. for count of 28 and increased bleeding
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, with ?contribution of HIT.   Appears to have consumptive
   process since losing transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now
   normalized. Fibrinogen nl.  Heparin and vanc stopped.  Pantoprazole
   could be etiology.
   - transfuse to goal 10, 50 if increased bleeding
   - send HIT and serotonin assay
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute.
   - cont CVVH likely [**1-10**] more days until BUN in 20
   - f/u repeat EEG
   - will D/C meropenem on [**2-3**] for course of Klebsiella therapy, very low
   suspicion for nosocomial bacterial meningitis
   .
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver.
   - Transfuse to HCT>30  in setting of demand ischemia
   - TTE shows biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion
   - off Dopamine maintaining good pressures, goal MAP>65
   - cont to trend LFTs, improving
   .
   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.
   - Neuro thinks its critical care myopathy with superimposed steroid
   myopathy.
   > BACTEREMIA:
 blood cx from [**1-25**] (off A-line) growing CoNS. A-line
   D/Ced. Off vanco.
   - surveillance blood cx (-) thus far
   .
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. Not anticoagulated, holding
   ASA, due to GI bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 30
   - will need to restart anti-platelet therapy when GI bleed resolves
   - recheck ECG this morning
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Continue CVVH with goal TBB -1 to 2L today
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   #. ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS: Pt has LFTs c/w ischemic injury, now trending
   down
   - monitor daily
   - hold any hepatotoxic or hepatically cleared meds
   .
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 cont insulin drip
   .
   # GOALS OF CARE: Fam mtg yesterday. Fam aware of poor prognosis given
   multiorgan failure. Hope is that mental status improves with CVVH,
   otherwise it will be clear that patient will not return to his baseline
   and they would favor withdrawing care. Will give CVVH another day or
   so.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with systolic heart failure who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient's respiratory failure is not due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but rather multifactorial including pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

The patient's pancytopenia is thought to be caused by meropenem, which can cause bone marrow suppression. The thrombocytopenia is likely due to uremic platelets and possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's altered mental status is improving gradually and is likely due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.

The patient's hypotension resolved after increasing cardiac output and weaning off dopamine. The patient's weakness is likely due to steroids and prolonged ICU course. The bacteremia is caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and is being treated with appropriate antibiotics.

The patient has evidence"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. He has shown improvement in oxygenation but continues to require assistance for breathing. The patient has been experiencing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and unclear indication for antibiotics, leading to the discontinuation of Meropenem. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 143/60 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal range. The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. He has received TPN with lipids and dialysis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and troponin-T, along with decreased levels of WBC, Hct, and platelets. The patient has been diagnosed with atrioventricular block, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, upper gastrointestinal bleed, respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring assistance for breathing, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk"

   edema.  Also appears to have had bleeding into RML after transbronchial
   biopsy, volume overload, and Klebsiella VAP.  Has completed 14 days of
   antibiotics for VAP, running negative on CVVH, and recently on high
   dose steroids (since tapered off).  Given prolonged intubation, likely
   needs tracheostomy.
   - Off antibiotics, completed course for Klebs
   - I/Os negative over 24hrs
   - Discuss w/IP re trach tomorrow
   - Off steroids, if worsens, consider restarting
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea on spontaneous breathing trials, indicating difficulty in breathing without mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of poor performance on pressure support ventilation trials.

The patient has been showing signs of low-grade bronchial respirator-associated pneumonia (BRBPR) and has undergone a transbronchial biopsy, which revealed unclear underlying lung disease, concern for COPD, and possible pulmonary edema. There is also evidence of bleeding into the right middle lobe after the biopsy, suggesting a complication from the procedure.

Additionally, the patient appears to have volume overload and has been diagnosed with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has completed a 14-day course of antibiotics for VAP and is currently off antibiotics. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal ranges, but there is evidence of right lower extremity edema.

The patient has renal failure, as indicated by the need for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and the presence of oliguria (low urine output). The patient's platelet count is low, and there are concerns about thrombocytopenia. The patient has tested positive for platelet factor 4 (PF4), which raises suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Unclear underlying lung disease, concern for
   COP on transbronchial biopsy, also has MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] so possible pulmonary
   edema.  Also appears to have had bleeding into RML after transbronchial
   biopsy, volume overload, and Klebsiella VAP.  Has completed 14 days of
   antibiotics for VAP, running negative on CVVH, and recently on high
   dose steroids (since tapered off).  Given prolonged intubation, likely
   needs tracheostomy.
   - Off antibiotics, completed course for Klebs
   - I/Os negative over 24hrs
   - Discuss w/IP re trach tomorrow
   - Off steroids, if worsens, consider restarting
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Trial off of CVVH, has reasonable UOP, follow
   electrolytes.  Renal is following, will assess if he requires
   intermittent HD.
   - PM lytes
   - Appreciate renal input
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, PANCYTOPENIA
 Dropped his WBC yesterday, has been
   persistently thrombocytopenic.  Heme consulted re thrombocytopenia, ?
   medication versus HIT versus consumptive.  PF4 positive, serotonin
   release assay pending.  Not anti-coagulating currently given GIB.
   - Follow-up serotonin release assay
   - Off of antibiotics, monitor counts
   - Keep Plt>10, if active bleeding transfuse to >50
   - Appreciate heme recs
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED
 Still w/small amounts of BRBPR but Hct and
   hemodynamically stable.  Likely had some ischemic colitis in the
   setting of hypotensive event last weekend.
   - Hct > 30, transfuse if needed
   - GI following, opting not to perform C-scope or EGD at present
 BIGEMINY
 HR has been decreasing to low 60s, but appears to be
   perfusing by exam.  Follow.
   - Telemetry
 HEART FAILURE, CHRONIC
 Is still quite volume up, although even for
   LOS here.  Had been running negative on CVVH, will try lasix to keep
   negative.
   - Goal I/O ~1L negative /24hrs
 HYPERNATREMIA
 Resolved on CVVH.
   - Follow lytes as off CVVH
 DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II
 On insulin SC, insulin w/TPN, follow
   fingersticks
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Likely toxic/metabolic given improvement
   w/holding sedation and CVVH to clear uremia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly individual with hypoxia and acute respiratory failure (ARF). They have been experiencing difficulty breathing during spontaneous breathing trials and have shown poor response to pressure support ventilation. The patient has a history of low-grade bloody respiratory secretions (BRBPR), which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. They also have bigeminy rhythm, indicating an irregular heart rate.

The patient's allergies include Heparin agents, for which they have tested positive on the platelet factor 4 (PF4) assay. The patient has been receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and insulin. Additionally, they have been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with potassium chloride infusion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a first-degree AV block, blood pressure ranging from 110/55 mmHg to 157/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 105.5 kg at admission to 95.7 kg currently.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium and magnesium levels, decreased sodium bicarbonate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The CXR reveals stable left basal and right middle to lower op"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to
   extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   - cont PSV trial daily
   - likely will need trach since intubated 3 weeks and will need to
   regain strength prior to extubation
   - consult IP for trach/peg at bedside
   - now off steroids
   .
   >. FEVER/UTI: Pt febrile to 100.1 axillary. CXR this AM shows RLL
   infiltrate more concerning  for infection. Respiratory status
   unchanged, no increase secretions. Prior sputum has grown pan-[**Last Name (un) 270**]
   Klebsiella but has been hospitalized and intubated >3 weeks so high
   risk of resistant organisms.
   Also UA c/w infection, changed Foley and started vanco/cefepime for
   UTI. Line infection is also a concern, will monitor blood cx and D/C
   fem HD cath after HD tomorrow.
   - f/u cx
   - add cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   - cont vanco/cefepime, renally dosed
   >. Pancytopenia
 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia, would
   continue to trend. Heme/onc thought drug-related although unclear why
   plts so low. HIT + but SRA pending. Smear unremarkable. Alternative
   explanation is that patient had baseline leucopenia prior to high dose
   steroids, and we are now seeing this return to baseline.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - switch pantoprazole to ranitidine
   - send HIT + and serotonin assay
 pending
   - send SPEP, UPEP
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   - consider BM bx
   - transfuse for Hct>28, Plt>10 unless bleeding
   - check [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Continue CVVH with goal TBB -1 to 2L today
   - appreciate renal recs
   >  GI BLEED
 Likely lower GIB, unclear source and patient never
   bleeding enough to scope. Now improved with only oozing when rectum
   cleaned. Also having oral mucosal bleeding, with friable mucosa.
   - send HSV and CMV
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving Likely [**2-10**] poor
   hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.  MRI showedrior right MCA infarct, nothing acute.
   Patient now improving towards baseline, interactive and appropriate.
   - trial off CVVH, BUN increasing and will have HD tomorrow
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, and pancytopenia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Fever/UTI: The patient has a fever of 100.1 axillary, and a chest X-ray shows right lower lobe infiltrate, which is more concerning for infection. Given the patient's prolonged hospitalization and intubation, there is a high risk of resistant organisms. The patient has been started on vancomycin and cefepime for UTI and also has a Foley catheter infection. Blood cultures and dialysis catheter cultures are pending.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia with low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count. The cause is unclear, but it is suspected to be drug-related, possibly due to meropenem. The patient's hematology/oncology recommendations are being followed, including switching pantoprazole to ranitidine, sending HIT and serotonin assays, SPEP, UPEP, and considering a bone marrow biopsy.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Had been
   improving and requiring less and less support, however today after
   going to low level pressure support, after 30 minutes he became
   tachycardic, and tachypneic and required return to ventilatory support
   at CMV.  He also had some evidence of anxiety vs fatigue which is what
   I suspect the etiology of his tachypnea and decompensation was.  He
   rapidly recovered with no intervention making PE and Right sided MI
   unlikely.  X-ray was inconsistent with flash.
   .
    Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - consider BM bx
   - transfuse for Hct>21, Plt>10 unless bleeding

   #. Thrombocytopenia
progressive thrombocytopenia with uremic
   platelets, with ?contribution of HIT.   Appears to have consumptive
   process since losing transfused plts rapidly. PT and PTT now
   normalized. Fibrinogen nl.  Heparin and vanc stopped.  Pantoprazole
   could be etiology.
   - transfuse to goal 10, 50 if increased bleeding
   - send HIT + and serotonin assay
 pending
   - consider holding nonessential meds
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving very gradually.  We
   will continue off sedation.  Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Patient
   now answering questions, following commands.  Able to move lower
   extremities, not upper extremities.  MRI shows prior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute.
   - trial off CVVH

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory failure has improved but recently experienced a decompensation requiring return to ventilatory support. The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure, ANCA-associated vasculitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and obstructive lung disease. Imaging from outside the hospital shows clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. The patient's fever is likely due to urinary tract infection (UTI), and he has been started on vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's pancytopenia is suspected to be drug-related, and further investigation is pending. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is thought to be lower gastrointestinal in origin and has now resolved. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely uremic with a possible contribution from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's altered mental status is improving gradually, and an MRI shows prior right middle cerebral artery infarct, with no acute changes. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and the underlying cause is believed to be related to heart failure. The patient's weakness is attributed to steroids and"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).  Now
   evidence for new VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.  Consult IP service for trach/PEG.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   FEVER -- Attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor temperature.
   HYPOTENSION --  Currently improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   CAD -- recent evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Now off CVVH since yesterday.
   Monitor intrinsic renal function.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation in progress.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.  D/C TPN.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Continues to resolve
   slowly.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There have been gradual signs of clinical improvement, but the patient still has limited progress. The etiology for the infiltrates is unclear and may be multifactorial, including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is now evidence for new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a right lower lobe infiltrate. The plan is to continue steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy may be considered if there is no continued progress, and the family is considering long-term options. Consultation with the interventional pulmonology (IP) service for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is needed.

The patient also has generalized motor weakness attributed to ICU neuropathy, which is expected to recover gradually. There was bacteremia likely related to a line infection, and the arterial line was discontinued. Antimicrobials will be continued to full course.

The patient had hypotension, which has now improved. Blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be monitored, and the MAP should be maintained above 60 mmHg.

There is evidence of myocardial damage, suggesting possible demand ischemia due to CAD. The patient's condition is now stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).  Now
   evidence for new VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.  Consult IP service for trach/PEG.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   FEVER -- Attributed in part to bacteremia.  Monitor temperature.
   HYPOTENSION --  Currently improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   CAD -- recent evidence for myocardial damage --> possible demand
   ischemia.  Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Now off CVVH since yesterday.
   Monitor intrinsic renal function.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation in progress.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.  D/C TPN.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Continues to resolve
   slowly.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates, leading to multisystem organ failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. There have been gradual signs of clinical improvement.

The patient's respiratory failure has not shown significant progress. The etiology of the infiltrates is unclear and may be multifactorial, including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is evidence of new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a right lower lobe infiltrate. The plan is to continue steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy may be considered if there is no continued progress, and a consultation with the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) service for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is planned.

The patient also has generalized motor weakness attributed to ICU neuropathy, likely due to the use of steroids and paralytic agents. It is expected that there will be a gradual recovery.

Additionally, the patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in the blood culture, which is likely line-related. The plan is to continue antimicrobials to complete the full course. The patient's fever is attributed in part to bacteremia and should be monitored"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to
   extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   - cont PSV trial daily
   - IP deferring trach until platelets consistently greater than 50
   - now off steroids
   - Keep at least -1L per day
   - Continue to treat? VAP

   concerning  for infection. Respiratory status unchanged, no increase
   secretions. Prior sputum has grown pan-[**Last Name (un) 270**] Klebsiella but has been
   hospitalized and intubated >3 weeks so high risk of resistant
   organisms.
   Also UA c/w infection, changed Foley and started vanco/cefepime for
   UTI. Line infection is also a concern, will monitor blood cx and D/C
   fem HD cath after HD tomorrow.

 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia, would
   continue to trend. Heme/onc thought drug-related although unclear why
   plts so low. HIT + but SRA pending. Smear unremarkable. Alternative
   explanation is that patient had baseline leucopenia prior to high dose
   steroids, and we are now seeing this return to baseline.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - switch pantoprazole to ranitidine
   - send HIT + and serotonin assay
 pending
   - send SPEP, UPEP
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   - consider BM bx
   - transfuse for Hct>28, Plt>10 unless bleeding
   - check [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Off CVVH
   - Plan for HD tuesday
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 Likely lower GIB, unclear source and patient never
   bleeding enough to scope. Now improved with only oozing when rectum
   cleaned. Also having oral mucosal bleeding, with friable mucosa.
   - send HSV and CMV
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving Likely [**2-10**] poor
   hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.  MRI showedrior right MCA infarct, nothing acute.
   Patient now improving towards baseline, interactive and appropriate.
   - trial off CVVH, BUN increasing and will have HD tomorrow
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver. Repeat TTE showed biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI), altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by various factors including respiratory failure, pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which was not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis included CHF, ANCA-associated vasculitis, VAP, and obstructive lung disease. The patient's imaging showed clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy. Current barriers to extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
2. Fever/UTI: The patient is currently afebrile, but the chest X-ray from this morning shows right lower lobe infiltrate, which is more concerning for infection. Prior sputum has grown pan-resistant Klebsiella, and the patient is at high risk for resistant organisms. The patient has also been started on vancomycin and cefepime for a urinary tract infection (UTI), and there is concern for line infection, which will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Differential of initial failure includes CHF, ANCA-associated
   vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH).  Patients last PFTs were noted to
   be consistent with mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Autoantibodies such as [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were noted to be negative, and are
   negative on repeat here.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside
   hospital shows clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process
   is multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD
   with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to
   extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   - cont PSV trial daily
   - IP deferring trach until platelets consistently greater than 50
   - now off steroids
   - Keep at least -1L per day
   - Continue to treat? VAP

   >. FEVER/UTI: Currently afebrile CXR this AM shows RLL infiltrate more
   concerning  for infection. Respiratory status unchanged, no increase
   secretions. Prior sputum has grown pan-[**Last Name (un) 270**] Klebsiella but has been
   hospitalized and intubated >3 weeks so high risk of resistant
   organisms.
   Also UA c/w infection, changed Foley and started vanco/cefepime for
   UTI. Line infection is also a concern, will monitor blood cx and D/C
   fem HD cath after HD tomorrow.
   - f/u cx
   - add cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   - cont vanco/cefepime, renally dosed

   >. Pancytopenia
 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia, would
   continue to trend. Heme/onc thought drug-related although unclear why
   plts so low. HIT + but SRA pending. Smear unremarkable. Alternative
   explanation is that patient had baseline leucopenia prior to high dose
   steroids, and we are now seeing this return to baseline.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - switch pantoprazole to ranitidine
   - send HIT + and serotonin assay
 pending
   - send SPEP, UPEP
   - Would hold off on anti-coagulation at least until SRA returns
   - consider BM bx
   - transfuse for Hct>28, Plt>10 unless bleeding
   - check [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. On CVVH. Hyperkalemia
   persistant on CVVH, likely due to cell destruction and muscle ischemia
   given high CKs.
   - Off CVVH
   - Plan for HD tuesday
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 Likely lower GIB, unclear source and patient never
   bleeding enough to scope. Now improved with only oozing when rectum
   cleaned. Also having oral mucosal bleeding, with friable mucosa.
   - send HSV and CMV
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 30, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Improving Likely [**2-10**] poor
   hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.  MRI showedrior right MCA infarct, nothing acute.
   Patient now improving towards baseline, interactive and appropriate.
   - trial off CVVH, BUN increasing and will have HD tomorrow
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved.  Initially, low central venous oxygen
   saturation suggested inadequate cardiac output.  Vigeleo readings
   suggested normal to high SV and CO, thus pt likely requiring higher
   cardiac output than can be achieved without demand . LVEF 30-35% on
   TTE. Pt had recent demand ischemia, in setting of fever and GI bleed
   with anemia, now CE trending down.  Also had complication of shock
   liver. Repeat TTE showed biV dysfunction, no changes, no effusion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting from outside with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressures set at PSV mode, and their respiratory status is unchanged. The patient's mental status is improving, and they are now interactive and appropriate. The patient has shown improvement in strength and is tolerating low levels of activity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and currently remains on mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause of this condition includes pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of fever and a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is more concerning for an infection. The patient has been started on vancomycin and cefepime for a urinary tract infection (UTI), and there is also a concern for line infection. Monitoring of blood cultures and consideration for removal of the femoral line after hemodialysis tomorrow is planned.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has shown signs of p"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Evidence for VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.  Consult IP service for trach/PEG.  Consider repeat
   bronchoscopy.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   CAD --  evidence for recent myocardial damage --> Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- s/p ATN.  Now remains off CVVH.  Continue to monitor
   intrinsic renal function.
   LEFT ARM SWELLING -- concern for thrombus --> NIVS
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] also be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation following.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin products.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male who initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates.
- The patient has experienced multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- There has been gradual clinical improvement, but the patient still requires mechanical ventilation.
- The etiology of the infiltrates is unclear, but it is believed to be multifactorial, including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- There is evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the right lower lobe.
- The patient's generalized motor weakness is attributed to ICU neuropathy, which is expected to improve gradually.
- The patient has bacteremia with GPC in the blood culture, likely due to a line-related infection.
- There is evidence of recent myocardial damage, which is now stable.
- The patient has melena/hematemesis, possibly from an upper gastrointestinal source, in the context of profound thrombocytopenia.
- The patient has renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but intrinsic renal function is now off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- The patient has left arm swelling, raising concerns for thrombus formation.
- The patient has anemia, which is multifactorial"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. He has been diagnosed with multiple organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrates, which could indicate a VAP. The plan is to continue steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.

2. Motor weakness, generalized: The patient is experiencing generalized motor weakness attributed to ICU neuropathy. This is expected to improve gradually.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has GPC in the blood culture, likely line-related. The plan is to continue antimicrobials to full course.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has evidence of recent myocardial damage, but it is now stable.

5. Melena/haematemesis: The patient has melena, and there are concerns about an upper gastrointestinal source. The plan is to maintain venous access, monitor serial Hct, and transfuse if necessary.

6. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The plan is to continue monitoring intrinsic renal function.

7. Left arm swelling: The patient has swelling in the left arm, which is a concern for"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI), altered mental status. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, and positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 138/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's laboratory results show an elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient also has anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and pancytopenia.

The patient's current medications include midazolam (Versed), famotidine (Pepcid), and various antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been started on argatroban for treatment of HIT-associated DVT.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated, and has shown gradual signs of clinical improvement. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to diffuse infiltrates, which may be multifactorial including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently on steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy is being considered if there is no continued progress, and a consultation for an IP service for tracheostomy/PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) has been requested.

The patient is also experiencing generalized motor weakness, which is attributed to ICU neuropathy. This is expected to improve gradually over time.

Bacteremia, likely line-related, has been identified with GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in the blood culture. The patient's arterial line has already been discontinued, and the plan is to continue with full-course antimicrobials.

A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been detected in the right femoral vein, and argatroban therapy has been initiated. The target PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is 60-80.

The patient has evidence of recent myocardial damage, which is now stable.

Melena/haematemesis is present,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male who presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. The patient has been diagnosed with multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. There have been gradual signs of clinical improvement, but the patient still experiences limited progress in respiratory failure. The etiology of the infiltrates is unclear, with possible causes including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is receiving steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy is being considered if there is no continued progress, and a consultation with the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) service for tracheostomy/Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) has been requested.

The patient is also experiencing generalized motor weakness attributed to ICU neuropathy. This is expected to result in a gradual recovery. Bacteremia due to a probable line-related infection is being treated with antimicrobials. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right femoral vein has been diagnosed, and argatroban therapy has been initiated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting from an outside hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient also has a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test and a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's initial presentation included hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and altered mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, DVT, GI bleed, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and coronary artery disease. The patient's condition has been improving, with resolution of hypotension and GI bleed. However, the patient still requires ongoing management for respiratory failure, DVT, renal failure, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a positive HIT antibody test and a confirmed right lower extremity DVT. There is a concern for further clot propagation or new clot formation.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: The patient had a likely lower gastrointestinal bleed, which has improved but may require further evaluation and management.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, intrinsic renal injury, and post-renal obstruction.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are low, suggesting a pancytopenia. This could be due to bone marrow suppression or other causes.
6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has evidence of worsening ischemia and elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating possible demand ischemia or acute coronary syndrome.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires careful management of multiple organ systems, including respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hematologic systems."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure who presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test. The patient's condition includes respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), fever, pancytopenia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, hypotension, coronary artery disease (CAD), biventricular systolic heart failure, ischemic hepatitis, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and has a history of BOOP. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and exacerbation of heart failure.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed lower extremity DVT and a positive HIT antibody test. This puts him at risk for further thrombotic events such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Fever: The patient's fever could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is important.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, red"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Evidence for VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.  Consult IP service for trach/PEG.  Consider repeat
   bronchoscopy.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   DVT -- right femoral --> argatroban now started.  Aim for PTT 60-80.
   CAD --  evidence for recent myocardial damage --> Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- s/p ATN.  Now remains off CVVH.  Continue to monitor
   intrinsic renal function.
   LEFT ARM SWELLING -- concern for thrombus --> NIVS
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] also be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation following.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin products.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.  D/C TPN.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Continues to resolve
   slowly.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 128/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's medical history is significant for diffuse infiltrates, multisystem organ failure (including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia), and now gastrointestinal bleeding. There are gradual signs of clinical improvement. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing management for respiratory failure with continued steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is being considered if there is no continued progress, and a consult for IP service for trach/PEG has been requested. Motor weakness, generalized, is attributed to ICU neuropathy and is expected to recover gradually. Bacteremia, likely line-related, is being treated with antimicrobials. DVT in the right femoral vein has been treated with argatroban, aiming for a PTT of 60-80. Evidence for recent myocardial damage has stabilized. Melena/haematemesis, possibly from an upper gastrointestinal source, is being monitored along with serial Hct and transfusion as needed. Renal failure, secondary to AT"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Evidence for VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.  Consult IP service for trach/PEG.  Consider repeat
   bronchoscopy.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   DVT -- right femoral --> argatroban now started.  Aim for PTT 60-80.
   CAD --  evidence for recent myocardial damage --> Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- s/p ATN.  Now remains off CVVH.  Continue to monitor
   intrinsic renal function.
   LEFT ARM SWELLING -- concern for thrombus --> NIVS
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] also be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation following.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin products.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.  D/C TPN.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Continues to resolve
   slowly.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates, which have been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and multisystem organ failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and steroids, and a tracheostomy is being considered for long-term management.

2. Motor Weakness, Generalized: The patient is experiencing generalized motor weakness, which is attributed to ICU neuropathy caused by the use of steroids and paralytic agents. Gradual recovery is anticipated.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has GPC in their blood culture, likely due to a line-related infection. The line has been discontinued, and the patient is receiving a full course of antimicrobials.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a right femoral DVT and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with argatroban. The target PTT level is 60-80.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient shows evidence of recent myocardial damage, but now appears to be stable.

6. Melena/Hematemesis: The patient is experiencing melena and hematemesis, possibly from an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source. Profound thrombocytopenia may also contribute to the bleeding. Venous access is maintained, and serial Hct measurements are being performed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient has also experienced hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to several factors including congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), obstructive lung disease, or an unknown primary problem causing initial hemoptysis. Imaging and pathological reports confirmed the presence of BOOP. Current barriers to extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.

2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a lower extremity DVT. He is positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is currently being treated with argatroban.

3. Fever: The patient is currently afebrile, but a recent chest X-ray showed right lower lobe infiltrate, which is concerning for infection. The patient's sputum cultures have grown pan-resistant Klebsiella, and he has been hospitalized and intubated for more than three weeks"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), fever, pancytopenia, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoemic respiratory failure may progress to severe respiratory distress requiring increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, purulent secretions, and positive blood cultures for CoNS suggests the possibility of sepsis. This could lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potential septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Evidence for VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.   Will discuss with thoracic and IP service for timing of
   trach/PEG (consider plts transfusion).  [**Month (only) 51**] require surgical trach and
   G-tube placement if remains with thrombocytopenia.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   DVT -- right femoral --> argatroban now started.  Aim for PTT 60-80.
   CAD --  evidence for recent myocardial damage --> Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- s/p ATN.  Now remains off CVVH.  Continue to monitor
   intrinsic renal function.
   LEFT LEG DVT -- Argatroban
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] also be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation following.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin products.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.  D/C TPN.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Continues to resolve
   slowly.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male who initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now gastrointestinal bleeding. There have been gradual signs of clinical improvement.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. These include respiratory failure, generalized motor weakness attributed to ICU neuropathy, bacteremia likely related to a central line, deep vein thrombosis in the right femoral vein, coronary artery disease with evidence of recent myocardial damage, melena/hematochezia of unclear source possibly due to an upper gastrointestinal source, renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis, left leg deep vein thrombosis, anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia attributed to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT+) and medication use, liver function abnormalities consistent with shock liver, and nutritional support.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications, including steroids, antimicrobials, and insulin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 131/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom initially respiratory distress/diffuse infiltrates, complicated
   by multisystem organ failure (respiratory failure, renal failure,
   persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and now GI bleed).
   Gradual signs of clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- limited progress.  Unclear etiology for
   infiltrates (diffuse, scattered, bilateral).   Now multifactorial
   (including diffuse pulmonary disease, CAD, CHF, underlying COPD).
   Evidence for VAP (RLL infiltrate).  Continue steroids --> taper,
   continue antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider
   tracheostomy if no contined progress, family considering long-term
   option.   will discuss with thoracic and IP service for timing of
   trach/PEG (consider plts transfusion).
   MOTOR WEAKNESS, GENERALIZED -- attributed to ICU neuropathy (attributed
   to steroids and paralytic use).  Anticipate gradual recovery.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC in blood culture, likley line-related (PICC, a-line,
   dialysis catheter).  A-line d/c'd.  Plan continue antimicrobials to
   full course.
   DVT -- right femoral --> argatroban now started.  Aim for PTT 60-80.
   CAD --  evidence for recent myocardial damage --> Now stable.
   MELENA/HEMATOCHEZIA -- unclear source, but concerns include UGI source
   (PUD, gastritis) in context of profound thrombocytopenia.  Maintain
   venous access, serial Hct, transfuse.  Transfuse plts, correct
   coagulopathy, dDAVP.
   RENAL FAILURE -- s/p ATN.  Now remains off CVVH.  Continue to monitor
   intrinsic renal function.
   LEFT LEG DVT -- Argatroban
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial.  Now evidence for blood loss, GI source.
   Monitor serial Hct, transfuse if Hct < 28.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 insulin infusion, monitor glucose, maintain glucose
   <150.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to HIT+ and in part to mediations
   (meropenem, pentoprozol).  [**Month (only) 51**] also be attributed to active GI bleed
   (consumption).  Monitor.   Hematology consultation following.
   HIT+ -- avoid heparin products.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating TF.  D/C TPN.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- consistent with shock liver.  Continues to resolve
   slowly.
   DISPOSITION -- DNR currently.  Maintain discussions with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male who was initially admitted with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates. He has since developed multisystem organ failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, persistent coma, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite some gradual signs of clinical improvement, the patient remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and diffuse infiltrates, indicating possible pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The etiology of the infiltrates is unclear, and it is multifactorial, including diffuse pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient continues to be mechanically ventilated and requires ongoing monitoring and management.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate, which may indicate VAP. This condition is a common complication in critically ill patients who are intubated for an extended period. The treatment plan includes continuing steroids, antimicrobials, and mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy may be considered if there is no continued progress.

3. Motor Weakness, Generalized: The patient exhibits generalized motor weakness attributed to ICU neuropathy, likely caused by the use of steroids and paralytic medications. It is anticipated that there will be a gradual recovery.

4. Bacteremia: The patient"

","The patient is a 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI), and altered mental status. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute hypoxic respiratory failure and underlying COPD with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to extubation are congestive heart failure (CHF), muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and has a right lower extremity DVT. Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been started to manage the DVT.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), which may be due to pre-renal azotemia, intrinsic renal injury, or post-renal obstruction. The BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, and the patient has been treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a likely lower gastrointestinal bleed, which is unclear in"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from the outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancytopenia. 

The patient is currently experiencing fever, with a peak temperature of 101.2°F. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but his blood cultures have been negative. Imaging from the outside hospital shows clear right middle lobe hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy, indicating a possible pulmonary hematoma. 

The patient has a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test and has developed a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is being treated with argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor. 

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and he is now experiencing acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal injury, and postrenal obstruction. 

The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, likely lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which is unclear in origin. He is showing signs of improvement but continues to have some oozing when his rectum is cleaned. 

Additionally, the patient is suffering from altered mental status, likely"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on argatroban, indicating a positive HITT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and has a history of lower extremity DVT.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine output is noted, suggesting a possible UTI.

3. Atrioventricular (AV) Block: The patient has a first-degree AV block, which is an abnormality in the heart's electrical conduction system.

4. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient's platelet count was low at 19K and was transfused yesterday. The count has improved to 38 today, but close monitoring of the platelet count is necessary.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleed, Upper (Melena, GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has melena, indicating an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The hematocrit (Hct) is stable, but further evaluation with endoscopy is needed.

6. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient has acute respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Treatment for VAP is ongoing, and the patient's secretions have improved. A"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI), altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), type II, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of COPD, which can lead to chronic respiratory problems. Additionally, the presence of BOOP suggests an underlying pulmonary issue, which may predispose the patient to further respiratory complications.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and CAD. The worsening ischemia in leads I and aVL, along with elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, troponin), indicate ongoing myocardial injury. This increases the risk of further cardiac events such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or even cardiogenic shock.

3. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely secondary to hypoperfusion and the recent gastrointestinal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and altered mental status. The patient's condition is multifactorial, including pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), lower extremity: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of central venous catheters. The patient's argatroban therapy should be continued with a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 50-70.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is at risk for UTI due to urinary catheterization. Cultures should be monitored, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered if infection is suspected.
3. Atrioventricular (AV) block: The patient's cardiovascular status may be compromised, and the presence of an AV block indicates potential cardiac dysfunction.
4. Bacteremia: The patient's altered mental status and fever suggest the possibility of bacteremia, which should be evaluated through blood cultures.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute on chronic kidney injury, altered mental status, and other comorbidities. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is being considered for extubation.

The patient has pancytopenia, which is likely due to meropenem-induced bone marrow suppression. The patient's renal failure is attributed to prerenal azotemia caused by poor forward flow and intravascular depletion, as well as intrinsic renal injury. The patient has undergone continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient also has a gastrointestinal bleed, likely from a lower gastrointestinal source. There is no clear source identified, and the patient is currently oozing when the rectum is cleaned. The patient has mucosal bleeding and friable muc"

 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE:  Platelet count slightly up today.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB):  Transfused 1
   u pRBCs for Hct 26, goal higher given underlying CAD. Diuresed with
   blood transfusion.  Given that we are anticipating placement of PEG,
   will readdress need for EGD with GI team prior to this procedure.
   Stool appears brown without melena or BRBPR.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Resolved.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  PEEP weaned to 5
   overnight.  VAP on vanco/cefipime/cipro/flagyl.  Grown Klebsiella in
   the past. Now with GNRs on gram stain again.  Not clear he has a new
   process as secretions seem to be clearing of old process.  Followup on
   final ID of GNRs, follow clinically without change in antibiotic
   course.  Anticipate tracheostomy per IP/surgical service in the OR,
   ?Monday.  Will check with them, hold tube feeds and anticoagulation
   prior to procedure.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE):  Stable.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Cr slightly
   increased.  Maybe will improve intravascular status in setting of blood
   transfusion.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM):  Improved with free water replacement.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  RISS, consider increase glargine.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, and anemia. The patient has received several blood transfusions and is being treated with anticoagulation therapy due to deep vein thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypernatremia, and altered mental status. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Continues on argatroban.
2. Thrombocytopenia, acute: Platelet count slightly up today.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB): Transfused 1 unit packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 26, goal higher given underlying coronary artery disease. Diuresed with blood transfusion. Will readdress need for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with GI team prior to placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
4. Hypotension (not shock): Resolved.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute kidney injury. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, which can lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has maroon-colored stools indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not appropriately treated.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed effectively.

5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's worsening ischemia and elevated cardiac markers suggest underlying CAD, which can lead to myocardial infarction if not treated promptly.

6. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Continued monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are essential to prevent or manage any potential infections.

7. Hepatic complications: The patient has evidence of ischemic hepatitis, and further monitoring of liver function is necessary to prevent any hep"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient has multiple medical complications including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), atrioventricular (AV) block, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), hypotension, respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), type II, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a positive HIT Ab with right lower extremity DVT. Argatroban has been started, and the goal PTT is 50-70. Monitoring of platelets is ongoing for recovery.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient may have a urinary tract infection, although the blood and urine cultures are negative. Antibiotics are being continued as per previous orders.
3. Atrioventricular (AV) Block: The patient has a first-degree AV block, which may be exacerbated by certain medications or underlying conditions.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has evidence of bacteremia, and the source is likely from the respiratory tract. Antibiotics are being administered empirically.
5. Thrombocytopenia"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute kidney injury. The patient has been hospitalized for more than three weeks, intubated, and is now experiencing multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Lower Extremity: The patient has a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test and has developed a right lower extremity DVT. Argatroban therapy has been initiated.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture results are pending, but there are signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count.
3. Atrioventricular (AV) Block: The patient has a first-degree AV block, which may be related to the ongoing coronary artery disease (CAD) and medication effects.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has been febrile for 36 hours, and there is concern for bacteremia, possibly due to a resistant organism.
5. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient has pancytopenia, and platelet levels may be slowly improving.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GI Bleed): The patient has experienced lower gastrointestinal bleeding and oral mucosal bleeding. The source of the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Lower Extremity: The patient has a positive HIT Ab and RLE DVT, indicating a possible blood clot in the lower extremity. This condition can lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not explicitly stated, the presence of a urinary catheter and elevated white blood cell count may suggest a urinary tract infection.

3. Atrioventricular (AV) Block: The patient has a first-degree AV block, which is a type of heart block that affects the electrical conduction system of the heart. This condition can potentially progress to higher-degree heart blocks and lead to serious complications.

4. Bacteremia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures indicate bacteremia, which means bacteria are present in the bloodstream. This can be a precursor to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.

5. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or medications.

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Differential of initial failure includes CHF, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH) possibly with another unknown
   primary problem causing initial hemoptysis.  Patients last PFTs mild to
   moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti-GBM
   negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows
   clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is
   multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with
   ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to
   extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   - cont PSV trial daily

   - Plan for trach tomorrow, d/w thoracic surgery, they will have pt
   transferred to West MICU tomorrow morning then do trach there then
   return pt here after 24 hours.
   - Holding argatroban tonight for possible procedure tomorrow
   - Continue to treat VAP with vanco/cipro/cefepime/flagyl
      - Vancomycin changed from 1gm Q24 to 1gm Q48 given vanc trough of

   unremarkable. HIT positive, SRA neg, +RLE DVT. WBC now trending up
   while platelets may be stablilzing/slowly improving. Pt continues to
   have maroon colored stools. Pt with stable hematocrits.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - transfuse for Hct>27, Plt>20
   - check [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. s/p CVVH. BUN/Cr now
   trending up.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - goal even today
   - will minimize fluid intake with Abx, free water boluses
   - goal fluid balance even to slightly positive 500-1000cc
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 Likely lower GIB, unclear source and patient never
   bleeding enough to scope. Also having oral mucosal bleeding, with
   friable mucosa.  Stool maroon today suggesting return of GI bleed,
   again likely lower. HCTs stable .
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 27, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct checks
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) Much improved at this point.
   Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  MRI showedrior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute. Patient now improving towards baseline, interactive and
   appropriate.
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved
   .
   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. holding ASA, due to GI
   bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 27
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   - will need afterload reduction with ACEi once [**Last Name (un) **] resolves
   - avoid B blockade for now given significant first degree heart block

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has several medical complications including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), atrioventricular block, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleed (both upper and lower), hypotension, respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (CHF), renal failure, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, altered mental status, and ischemic hepatitis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes tracheostomy placement, continuous low-dose aspirin, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anticoagulation therapy with argatroban for DVT, and management of various other conditions such as pancytopenia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of further gastrointestinal bleeding, progression of renal failure, worsening of heart failure, and potential complications related to the upcoming tracheostomy procedure.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, hemodynamic stability, co"

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Path report c/w BOOP; and patient being treated for VAP. [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA,
   anti-GBM negative.  Imaging from outside hospital shows clear RML
   hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is multifactorial:
   pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with ground glass
   opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to extubation are CHF,
   muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   - cont PSV trial daily
 control anxiety with klonipin daily
   - Plan for trach, however, given GI bleed this will be put on hold
   (ultimately thoracic surgery will transfer pt to West MICU for
   procedure)
   - Continue to treat VAP with vanco/cipro/cefepime/flagyl for 14 day
   course
      - Vancomycin changed from 1gm Q24 to 1gm Q48 given vanc trough of
   21.
      - Vancomycin started on [**2-2**], then restarted
   [**2139-2-1**]-present.
      - Cipro [**Date range (3) 12975**], then restarted [**2139-2-2**]-present for
      - Cefepime started [**2139-2-1**].
      - Flagyl started on [**2139-2-5**].
   - follow up speciation of GNRs in sputum, likely Klebsiella
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 Likely lower GIB, unclear source and patient never
   bleeding enough to scope. Also having oral mucosal bleeding, with
   friable mucosa.  Stool maroon today suggesting return of GI bleed,
   again likely lower. HCTs stable .
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 27, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct checks
   - GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **]/EGD (discuss possible PEG placement)
   - If goes for PEG will likely need 3-4 units FFPs in the AM per GI
   - T&S Crossmatch 2units
   .
   >. Pancytopenia
 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia. Smear
   unremarkable. HIT positive, SRA neg, +RLE DVT. WBC now trending up
   while platelets may be stablilzing/slowly improving. Hct drop given GI
   bleed.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct check given GIB.
   - Transfuse for Hct>27, Plt>20
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   .
   >. DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY- HIT Ab positive with
   RLE DVT. Started argatroban. SRA negative so likely not HIT
   - Hold argatroban given GI bleed
   - Continue to monitor platelets for recovery
   - Discuss filter placement if pt cannot receive anticoagulation
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. s/p CVVH. BUN/Cr now
   trending up.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Goal even today
   - Follow urine output
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) Much improved at this point.
   Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  MRI showedrior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute. Patient now improving towards baseline, interactive and
   appropriate.

   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.
   Neuro thinks its critical care myopathy with superimposed steroid
   myopathy.

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. holding ASA, due to GI
   bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 27
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.

   regarding possible egd/colon to assess location of bleed, though
   suspect lower source.  Has remained HD stable throughout. Acute on
   chronic renal failure - responding well to lasix.  Will hold for now
   given bleeding. ICU: DNR. bowel reg, picc. Hold TFs given bleeding,
   pending GI input and stablization of hct. Remainder of plan as outlined

   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE, HYPOXEMIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Differential of initial failure includes CHF, VAP, and obstructive lung
   disease (noted on CT chest from OSH) possibly with another unknown
   primary problem causing initial hemoptysis.  Patients last PFTs mild to
   moderate restrictive ventilatory defect.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti-GBM
   negative.  Path report c/w BOOP.  Imaging from outside hospital shows
   clear RML hemorrhage post-bronchoscopy.  Current process is
   multifactorial: pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP and underlying COPD with
   ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to
   extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   - cont PSV trial daily
 control anxiety with klonipin daily
   - Plan for trach tomorrow, d/w thoracic surgery, they will have pt
   transferred to West MICU tomorrow morning then do trach there then
   return pt here after 24 hours.
   - Holding argatroban tonight for possible procedure tomorrow
   - Continue to treat VAP with vanco/cipro/cefepime/flagyl
      - Vancomycin changed from 1gm Q24 to 1gm Q48 given vanc trough of
   21.
      - Vancomycin started on [**2-2**], then restarted
   [**2139-2-1**]-present for a total of 12 days of 14 thus far.
      - Cipro [**Date range (3) 12975**], then restarted [**2139-2-2**]-present for a total
   of 10 days so far, continue for 4 more days (last dose [**2139-2-12**])
      - Cefepime started [**2139-2-1**] for day 9 of 14 (last dose [**2139-2-14**]).
      - Flagyl started on [**2139-2-5**] for day 5 of 14 (last dose [**2139-2-18**])
   - follow up speciation of GNRs in sputum, likely Klebsiella
   .

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY- HIT Ab positive
   with RLE DVT. Started argatroban. SRA negative but heme/onc rec
   continue argatroban given DVT with TCP
   - Continue argatroban with goal PTT 50-70
   - Continue to monitor platelets for recovery
   .
   >. FEVER: Febrile 60 hours ago, no fever in past 24 hours. CXR showed
   RLL infiltrate concerning  for infection.  Neg blood and urine cx.
   Prior sputum has grown pan-[**Last Name (un) 270**] Klebsiella but has been hospitalized
   and intubated >3 weeks so high risk of resistant organisms. D/Ced fem
   HD cath. Blood cx all neg. Consider removing lines if worsens or +blood
   cx.
   - f/u cx, monitor for clinical worsens, currently is improving
   - cont cefepime/cipro/vanco/flagyl as above
   .
   >. Pancytopenia
 Stopped meropenem which can cause pancytopenia. Smear
   unremarkable. HIT positive, SRA neg, +RLE DVT. WBC now trending up
   while platelets may be stablilzing/slowly improving. Pt continues to
   have maroon colored stools. Pt with stable hematocrits.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - transfuse for Hct>27, Plt>20
   - check [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)  DDx includes
   prerenal azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
   intrinsic. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well. s/p CVVH. BUN/Cr now
   trending up.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - goal even today
   - will minimize fluid intake with Abx, free water boluses
   - goal fluid balance even to slightly positive 500-1000cc
   .
   >  GI BLEED
 Likely lower GIB, unclear source and patient never
   bleeding enough to scope. Also having oral mucosal bleeding, with
   friable mucosa.  Stool maroon today suggesting return of GI bleed,
   again likely lower. HCTs stable .
   - cont to transfuse for goal Hct 27, plt 10 if not actively bleeding
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct checks
   - 3-4 units FFPs likely at 9am
   - T&S Crossmatch 2units
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) Much improved at this point.
   Likely [**2-10**] poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  MRI showedrior right MCA infarct,
   nothing acute. Patient now improving towards baseline, interactive and
   appropriate.
   .
 HYPOTENSION- resolved
   .
   > WEAKNESS -> likely [**2-10**] steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course.
   Neuro thinks its critical care myopathy with superimposed steroid
   myopathy.

   .
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 evidence of
   worsening ischemia laterally in I, aVL and worsening CK, troponin
   elevation. Likely demand. Pt not on statin at baseline and not
   candidate for initiation given shock liver. holding ASA, due to GI
   bleed.
   -  transfuse goal Hct > 27
   .
   > BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely [**2-10**] CAD.  Will need to
   optimize regimen with ACEi, possibly B-blockage (if PR prolongation has
   resolved) once renal failure and GI bleed resolve.  Transfusion goal as
   above.  No pressor support currently needed.
   - will need afterload reduction with ACEi once [**Last Name (un) **] resolves
   - avoid B blockade for now given significant first degree heart block

   DISPOSITION:  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] pending above
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 83M ?BOOP, hemoptysis, respiratory failure,
   ARF, DVT / low plts on argatroban.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.6 BP 111/55 HR 82 RR 18 with sat 99 on PSV 18/5
   0.4 7.39/35/36 (v). WD man, follows commands. Can raise shoulders
   against gravity, but can
t lift arms or legs off bed, weak handgrip.
   Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 3.7K,
   HCT 30, K+ 3.7, Cr 1.7, INR 2.3.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with
   ongoing supportive care for ILD/BOOP (off steroids for the moment given
   profound weakness), abx for nosocomial pneumonia, gentle diuresis for
   acute-on-chronic systolic CHF. Will consider repeat CT here (I-) to
   assess effusions and current state of parenchymal disease, but will
   hold off for the moment. [**Name2 (NI) 133**] need trach in the near future, patient
   appears OK with this, PLTs now >50K, BBS on file. Plan d/w Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   (T-[**Doctor First Name **]) - will transfer to West MICU team in AM with plan for OR
   tomorrow as add-on case. Slow GIB, follow HCT, d/w thoracics prior to
   OR - may be worth EGD in OR, suspect lower source, PPI, xfuse as
   needed. Will continue argatroban despite low grade GIB for femoral DVT.
   Acute on chronic renal failure - resume baseline lasix dose in AM, goal
   today slightly negative. DNR. Remainder of plan as outlined above

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels in their blood.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a clot in their lower extremity, which is a potential cause for concern.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): There is a possibility of a urinary tract infection based on the patient's symptoms and lab results.
4. Atrioventricular (AV) block: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, specifically a first-degree AV block.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteria in their blood, indicating a systemic infection.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can lead to bleeding disorders.
7. Gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed): The patient has experienced bleeding in their gastrointestinal tract, possibly from an unknown source.
8. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of waste products in their blood.
9. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has diabetes, but the exact management and control of their blood sugar levels are not mentioned.
10. Coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease: The patient shows evidence of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, possibly due to blockages in the coronary arteries.

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia) and acute on CKI (chronic kidney injury). The patient has been hospitalized for more than three weeks and is intubated. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's mental status has improved and he is now interactive and appropriate.

The patient has a history of altered mental status, likely due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and uremia causing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. An MRI showed prior right middle cerebral artery infarct, but nothing acute. The patient's weakness is attributed to steroids, paralysis, prolonged ICU course, and critical care myopathy with superimposed steroid myopathy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital on [**1-21**] for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronch for evaluation of ground glass opacities. In the ICU, he has experienced persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), GI bleed (gastrointestinal bleeding), pancytopenia, and recurrent VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is still on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 723 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has edema in both lower extremities and anasarca (generalized swelling). His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 57,000/mL, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Other lab results indicate possible infection and inflammation.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include recurrent VAP, fluid overload, possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), chronic heart failure with poor left ventricular ejection fraction, gastrointestinal bleeding, probable heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), chronic kidney disease, and critical illness myopathy. 

For each issue, the following plans have been made:
1. RESP FAILURE - The recurrent VAP has been resolved, but the patient still has fluid overload and possible BOOP. Antibiotics will be stopped today after a 14-day course. The patient will be monitored, and aggressive diuresis may be considered. A tracheostomy is planned today.
2. CHF - The patient's chronic heart failure with poor ejection fraction and fluid overload will be addressed, possibly with low-dose beta-blockers, but this will be deferred for now.
3. GI BLEED - Serial hematocrit measurements will be taken today, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be performed eventually. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) will be continued.
4. PROBABLE HIT - The patient has a pelvic and left external iliac deep vein thrombosis. Arg"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI,
   bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, transferred overnight for PEG /
   EGD / Post pyloric tube in AM.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Working diagnosis of BOOP, pt s/p HAP treatment
   x 2, currently afebrile and without evidence of ongoing infection.
   [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti-GBM negative. Currently though to be multifactorial
   from pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP (treated) and underlying COPD with
   ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. Current barriers to
   extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves.
   Needs long term option for vent support
   - Trach in place, tolerating well
   - s/p VAP course x 2 (lastly with vanco/cipro/cefepime/flagyl x 14 days
   finished [**2-10**])
   - Wean vent as tolerated, although expect prolonged intubation.
   .
   #. GI BLEED
 Unclear source of lower GI bleed, given prolonged ICU
   stay and thrombocytopenia, suspect mucosal source. Need to consider
   other etiologies such as mesenteric ischemia, colitis, etc. Slow
   downward trend in Hct overnight likely due to slow bleed, although
   within lab error
   - Transfusion goal per primary ICU team > 28, recieved 1U PRBC
   - q8H hct checks
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - maintain active T&S
   .
   # Pancytopenia
 Unclear etiology, hematology service following.
   - Thrombocytopenia thought to be [**2-10**] HIT
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - q6H Hct given ongoing bleed
   - Transfuse for Hct>27, Plt>20
   .
   # DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS: Holding Argatroban for procedure.
   - Continue to monitor platelets for recovery
   - [**Month (only) 51**] get filter placement due to difficulty with anticoagulation
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Patient tolerating being off CVVH although
   grossly with anasarca. BUN elevated [**2-10**] GI bleed as well.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Hold diuresis for upcoming procedures
   - Follow urine output
   .
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Per prior notes, appears improved. Patient
   appropiately answering yes /no questions and following commands
   -- continue to monitor
   .
   # WEAKNESS: Multifactorial in setting of prolonged ICU stay (ICU
   neuropathy / myopathy) etc
   -- PT once trach in place
   .
   # CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: holding ASA, due to GI bleed
   -- transfuse goal Hct > 27
   --
   .
   # BIVENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE-  Likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, last documented EF of 25 to 30%
   -- Holding ACEI given ARF
   -- Would benefit from beta blocker, even if low dose.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI), and altered mental status. The patient has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, and requires prolonged mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a working diagnosis of BOOP and previous hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) treatment. Current barriers to extubation include congestive heart failure (CHF), muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves. Long-term ventilation support may be needed.
2. GI Bleeding: The source of the lower GI bleed is unclear, but it could be due to mucosal damage, mesenteric ischemia, colitis, or other etiologies. Thrombocytopenia and prolonged ICU stay suggest a mucosal source. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of other etiologies is important.
3. Pancytopenia: The etiology of pancytopenia is unclear, but it may be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or another underlying condition. Hematology service is following up on this issue.
4. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): Argatroban, an anticoagulant, is being"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI,
   bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, transferred overnight for PEG /
   EGD / Post pyloric tube in AM.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Working diagnosis of BOOP, pt s/p HAP treatment
   x 2 (cultures grew pansensetive klebsiella), currently afebrile and
   without evidence of ongoing infection. [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti-GBM negative.
   Currently though to be multifactorial from pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP
   (treated) and underlying COPD with ground glass opacities of unknown
   etiology. Current barriers to extubation are CHF, muscular weakness,
   and underlying poor reserves. Needs long term option for vent support.
   New new signs of infection at this point (despite sputum cultures from
   [**2-9**] growing klebsiella)
   - Trach in place, tolerating well
   - s/p VAP course x 2 (lastly with vanco/cipro/cefepime/flagyl x 14 days
   finished [**2-10**])
   .
   #. GI BLEED
 Unclear source of lower GI bleed, given prolonged ICU
   stay and thrombocytopenia, suspect mucosal source. Need to consider
   other etiologies such as mesenteric ischemia, colitis, etc. Slow

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from outside the hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute on chronic kidney injury, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia twice and has been on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current barriers to extubation include congestive heart failure, muscular weakness, and underlying poor respiratory reserves. Long-term options for ventilator support are needed.

The patient has a history of unclear source lower gastrointestinal bleed, with suspicion of a mucosal source. Other etiologies such as mesenteric ischemia, colitis, etc. need to be considered. Slow downward trend in hematocrit overnight likely due to slow bleed, although within lab error. Transfusion goal per primary ICU team is >28, received 1 unit packed red blood cells. Q8H hct checks are recommended. Maintain active type and screen.

The patient has pancytopenia with unclear etiology, and the hematology service is following up. Thrombocytopenia thought to be HIT on 02/10. Appreciate heme/onc recs. Q8hct checks are recommended. Transfuse for Hct>27, Plt>20.

","The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, type II diabetes, and recent hospital admission for respiratory failure. He underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of ground glass opacities. In the ICU, he experienced persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleed, pancytopenia, and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/107 to 151/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. Other laboratory values are within normal limits. Imaging reveals bibasilar infiltrates resolving compared to several days ago. Microbiology testing shows Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum sample.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: Recurrent VAP is now resolved, but the patient still has fluid overload and possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The plan is to wean the patient off positive"

","Summary:
The patient presented with bloody rectal bleeding but was initially hemodynamically stable. A hematocrit test was performed, showing a stable result, and a type and crossmatch were ordered. The patient's blood pressure began to drop, leading to the initiation of a massive transfusion protocol and the administration of 2u Prbcs. A rigid sigmoidoscopy was performed, revealing evidence of ischemic colitis without any bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient is considered a non-surgical candidate due to the grave prognosis. Supportive care has been recommended, including the use of cipro/flagyl, but given the patient's DNR status, further active blood transfusions/antibiotics will not be given. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing blood loss.
2. Infection from the use of invasive procedures like sigmoidoscopy.
3. Organ failure due to decreased blood flow caused by ischemic colitis.
4. Respiratory distress from fluid overload or aspiration.
5. Development of coagulopathy from massive transfusion.
6. Septic shock from bacterial translocation from the colon due to ischemia."

","Summary:
The patient presented with blood in the rectum (BRBPR) and was initially hemodynamically stable. A hematocrit test was ordered, and a type and crossmatch was initiated. Plans were made for a GI bleeding scan and potential embolization, but the patient's blood pressure started to decline within 20 minutes. As a result, the patient was given two units of packed red blood cells and the massive transfusion protocol was initiated. General surgery was urgently called, and a rigid sigmoidoscopy revealed evidence of ischemic colitis without any bleeding hemorrhoid. The patient was deemed not a surgical candidate due to the grave prognosis. Cipro/Flagyl was recommended for antibiotic coverage, and supportive care was chosen over further blood transfusions or antibiotics due to the patient's do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure began to slowly drift down, indicating a potential complication of hypotension.
2. Ischemic colitis: The rigid sigmoidoscopy showed evidence of ischemic colitis, which is a condition where the blood supply to the colon is reduced, leading to inflammation and damage.
3. GI bleeding: Although no active bleeding was found during the sigmoidoscopy, there was initially a suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding based on the presence of BRBPR.
4. Infection: The recommendation of Cipro/Flagyl suggests a concern for infection, possibly due to the"

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with a working diagnosis of Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP). Other factors contributing to respiratory failure include pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia of unclear etiology, with thrombocytopenia possibly related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Hematology service is following up on this condition.

4. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and has undergone placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to prevent further clotting.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to the recent gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged use of cardiac medications. Renal recommendations are being followed, including diuresis with Lasix and monitoring urine output.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved but requires ongoing monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP. The patient has been complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, and transfer overnight for PEG/EGD/post pyloric tube in AM. The patient has ischemic colitis discovered on rigid scope overnight and is actively oozing. The patient is a poor surgical candidate, and surgery and GI are following up. The family has been made aware of the grave prognosis. The patient's bleeding has slowed down, and they will discuss goals of care this AM. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 50% and is tolerating it well. The patient's tracheostomy tube is in place, and they are responding appropriately to yes/no questions and following commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient continues to actively ooze from ischemic colitis, which can lead to further blood loss and hypotension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP (treated), and underlying COPD. The patient may require long-term options for vent support.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has unclear etiology pancytopenia, and the hematology service is following up. Thrombocyt"

   Assessment and Plan
   83M with systolic heart failure, presenting from OSH with acute
   hypoexmic respiratory failure with evidence of BOOP and acute on CKI,
   altered mental status.  Course complicated by hypotension, GI,
   bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, transferred overnight for PEG /
   EGD / Post pyloric tube in AM.
   #. GI BLEED
 Patient with ischemic colitis discovered on rigid scope
   overnight; continues to actively ooze and is a poor surgical
   candidate.  Surgery and GI following. Family made aware of grave
   prognosis
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Working diagnosis of BOOP, pt s/p HAP treatment
   x 2 (cultures grew pansensetive klebsiella), currently afebrile and
   without evidence of ongoing infection. [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti-GBM negative.
   Currently though to be multifactorial from pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP
   (treated) and underlying COPD with ground glass opacities of unknown
   etiology. Current barriers to extubation are CHF, muscular weakness,
   and underlying poor reserves. Needs long term option for vent support.
   New new signs of infection at this point (despite sputum cultures from
   [**2-9**] growing klebsiella)
   - Trach in place, tolerating well

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's impaired physical mobility is likely a result of the prolonged ICU stay and may increase the risk of further complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has already developed DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is at risk of developing a UTI due to catheterization and immobility.
5. Atrioventricular (AV) Block: The patient has an AV block, which can affect heart rhythm and potentially lead to cardiac complications.
6. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which can be caused by various factors including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, or drug-induced bone marrow suppression.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient continues to experience gastrointestinal bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronchoscopy to evaluate ground glass opacities. In the ICU, he has experienced persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible HIT, DVT, GI bleed, pancytopenia, and recurrent VAP. Recently, he developed a new BRBPR due to ischemic colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. LGIB (Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding) - presuming ischemic colitis. The patient should have serial Hct (hematocrit) measurements, and receive ciprofloxacin and Flagyl IV. IVF (intravenous fluids) and supportive care should be provided, with no intervention per GI service.
2. Acute respiratory failure - recurrent VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) now resolved, fluid overload, possible BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia), history of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The patient should be weaned off ventilator support, with PSV (pressure support ventilation) and peep (positive end-expiratory pressure) settings adjusted accordingly. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and Klebsiella pneumoniae identified in sputum cultures should be monitored for signs of new infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronchoscopic evaluation of ground glass opacities. In the ICU, he experienced persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), pancytopenia, and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Recently, the patient developed progressively worsening bloody brownish-red peripheral edema with associated systemic blood pressure drop. He received a blood transfusion and rigid colonoscopy was performed, with a clinical suspicion of ischemic colitis. The patient remains clinically stable after a family meeting with the attending physician.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications including acute respiratory failure, fluid overload, possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tracheostomy. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning and has tolerated a pressure of 10 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%.

Other significant medical issues include congestive heart failure (CHF) due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), renal failure, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and altered mental status. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include positive heparin, administration of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and continuous infusions of morphine sulfate and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/58 mmHg to 148/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has received a total of 2,043 mL of IV fluids since 41 AM, with an output of 505 mL of urine. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 507 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 68, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 22.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 186 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.5 mg/d"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia). He has been complicated by hypotension, GI bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including pancytopenia, deep vein thrombosis, renal failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including underlying COPD, pulmonary hematoma, CHF, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), and ground glass opacities of unknown etiology. The current barriers to extubation are CHF, muscular weakness, and underlying poor reserves. Long-term ventilation support may be needed.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has active GI bleeding due to ischemic colitis discovered on rigid scope. He is a poor surgical candidate, and the family has been made aware of the grave prognosis. The bleeding has slowed, but further management will be discussed with the family.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has unclear etiology pancytopenia, which is being followed by the hematology service. Thrombocytopenia is thought to be related to [**2-10**] HIT (hepar"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronchoscopy for evaluation of ground glass opacities. His ICU course has been notable for persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed), pancytopenia, and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

24-hour events include a possible GI bleed that is now stabilized, and the patient has undergone tracheostomy placement on POD (postoperative day) 3 and IVC filter placement on POD 2.

Assessment and plan include:
1. LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleed) due to presumed ischemic colitis. The patient is currently stable, but serial Hct (hematocrit) measurements will be followed. The patient will start on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl IV, and will receive supportive care. No surgical intervention is planned. Bowel rest will be maintained for now, and if the bleeding recurs, up to 2 units of blood may be given, but no more due to patient and family wishes.
2. Acute respiratory failure, which is now resolved. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning and has a trache"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, presenting from the operating room with acute hypoemic respiratory failure, evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and acute kidney injury (CKI). The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He was transferred overnight for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient's current medical problems include impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrioventricular (AV) block, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, acute upper gastrointestinal bleed (melena), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), renal failure, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), altered mental status, and ischemic colitis.

The patient's current medications include ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. He is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the GI bleed and is being managed with H2 blockers, pain management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure. He presented to the hospital with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI). The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), atrioventricular (AV) block, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, acute gastrointestinal bleed, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (CHF), renal failure, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus (DM) type II, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia. 

The patient's recent course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He underwent a procedure for placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) overnight. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed was discovered during the rigid scope examination and continues to actively ooze but is considered a poor surgical candidate. Surgery and gastroenterology services are following the case.

The patient's respiratory failure is thought to be multifactorial, including pulmonary hematoma, CHF, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying COPD with ground glass opacities of unknown etiology."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronchoscopy for evaluation of ground glass opacities. The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), GI bleed (gastrointestinal bleeding), pancytopenia, recurrent VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), and critical illness neuromyopathy.

24-hour events:
The patient has allergies to heparin agents and has received antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. He is currently on various ICU medications and other medications. There are no significant changes to his medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted complications.

Flowsheet data as of 2139-02-15 07:47 AM:
- Vital signs: Temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is relatively controlled, respiratory rate is within expected limits, and oxygen saturation is at 100%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a first-degree AV block.
- Fluid balance indicates an input of 1,555 mL and output of 800 mL.
- Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronchoscopic evaluation of ground glass opacities. The ICU course has been notable for persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), pancytopenia, and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Recent events include a thoracic consultation regarding a tracheostomy cuff leak, attempts to decrease cuff pressure, and unsuccessful tolerance of the tracheostomy mask due to high respiratory rate and anxiety. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 487 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 48, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and a saturation of oxygen (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.21, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 31 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after undergoing a bronchoscopy for evaluation of ground glass opacities. The ICU course has been notable for persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, pancytopenia, and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 487 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 48, and the blood gas analysis shows PaO2 of 21 mmHg, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, pH of 7.21, and base excess of -10.8 mEq/L.

The patient has a tracheostomy, and attempts to extubate him on tracheostomy mask were unsuccessful due to high respiratory rate and anxiety. The patient is alert and oriented, with no focal neurological deficits. Physical examination reveals clear"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic heart failure, acute on chronic kidney injury (CKI), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, poor surgical candidacy for GI bleeding, and ongoing respiratory failure. The patient is currently tolerating tracheostomy (Trach) mask ventilation but only with a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding. The patient's goals of care include ongoing discussion with the patient and family, with the current goal being to get the patient home as he refuses rehabilitation.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient has ischemic colitis, which has resulted in ongoing mild oozing of blood. The patient is a poor surgical candidate, and efforts are being made to stabilize the bleeding with medical management.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is thought to be multifactorial, involving pulmonary hematoma, congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has been treated for VAP twice and currently has a tracheostomy in place, tolerating mask ventilation.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient initially had thrombocytopenia, which was thought to be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, it"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, currently showing signs of improvement. They have been diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and volume overload. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/59 to 115/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving various medications, including furosemide, morphine sulfate, midazolam, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's ongoing respiratory status and the presence of a large tracheostomy tube may increase the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation, potentially leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.
2. Tracheomalacia: The elevated cuff pressures and consideration of placing a larger or longer tracheostomy tube suggest the possibility of tracheomalacia. This condition can lead to airway collapse and compromise breathing.
3. Ischemic colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with ischemic colitis, which is inflammation of the colon due to reduced blood flow. This condition can cause abdominal pain and potentially lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Elevated white blood cell count: The elevated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure who presented with acute hypoemic respiratory failure and evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and acute on chronic kidney injury. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, ongoing respiratory failure, and other medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has diffuse skin breakdown, indicating possible pressure ulcers or other skin integrity issues due to prolonged immobility.

2. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's impaired physical mobility may be related to his chronic heart failure, acute respiratory failure, and critical illness myopathy.

3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the lower extremity and received an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to prevent pulmonary embolism.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, the patient's urinary catheterization and immobility increase the risk of developing a UTI.

5. Atrioventricular (AV) Block: The patient's chronic heart failure may lead to conduction abnormalities, including AV block.

6. Bacteremia: The patient has had previous hospital-acquired pneumonia and required antibiotic treatment for Klebsiella infection. This increases"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse skin breakdown, which indicates a risk for pressure ulcers or bedsores.

2. Impaired physical mobility: The patient's current condition may limit their ability to move freely, increasing the risk of muscle weakness, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary complications.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the lower extremity, and there is a risk of clot formation due to immobility and other factors.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is at risk for UTI due to catheterization and decreased mobility.

5. Atrioventricular (AV) block: The patient has a history of AV block, which can lead to abnormal heart rhythms and potentially life-threatening complications.

6. Bacteremia: The patient's recent infections and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of bacteremia, where bacteria enter the bloodstream.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has experienced acute thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count and can increase the risk of bleeding.

8. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed): The patient has had episodes of GI bleeding, including ischemic colitis and melena. This can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is anxious about the possibility of passing away in the ICU. The patient has a history of bleeding and has refused blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and borderline low blood pressure. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance and intravenous fluid administration. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 100% through a tracheostomy tube, and they are receiving respiratory support. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, increased creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient's family has been updated on the patient's condition, and comfort measures have been prioritized. Plans for transfer to home with hospice care have been put on hold.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support indicate that they may be at risk of developing respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection in the body. This could potentially lead to sepsis or other complications related to the immune response.

3. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and refusal of blood transfusions put them at risk of further bleeding episodes. This could lead to complications such as hypotension, organ damage, or even hemorrhagic shock.

4. Kidney Dysfunction: The increasing"
