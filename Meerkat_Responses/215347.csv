   Assessment and Plan
   44-year-old man with hypertensive urgency.  His prior history of
   subarachnoid hemorrhage and PRES is concerning, though his CT and
   improved symptoms are both reassuring.
          Maintain and titrate nitroglycerin for now
          Avoid nitroprusside given renal failure
          Resume all of his home medications
          Treat headache since this may help with BP as well
          Urgent dialysis per renal
          If not improved in the next few hours, or if symptoms
   escalate, will add additional IV [**Doctor Last Name **] such as enalaprilat or
   nicardipine
   Will need further workup of etiology of hypertension.
   Murmur
   His murmur and arterial line tracing both suggest hypertrophic
   obstructive cardiomyopathy, although echo at the beginning of this year
   did not show it.  Repeat echo.
   Anemia
   Is mild.  Follow for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old man with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency. He has a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which are concerning but reassuring given the improved symptoms and normal CT scan. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 219/102 to 237/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. 

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished with clear breath sounds and no signs of crackles. His extremities are warm and well-perfused, and his neurological examination is intact. 

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL and elevated creatinine levels at 10.3 and 11.3 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction. Other labs are within normal limits.

The patient is currently being managed with nitroglycerin infusion to control blood pressure, morphine sulfate for pain, and other medications such as NTG, hydralazine, lisinopril, omeprazole, and valsaran.

The plan is to maintain and titrate nitroglycerin, avoid nitroprusside due to renal failure, resume home medications, treat headache, and provide urgent dialysis for renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o M with h/o malignant hypertension & ESRD on HD (s/p recent
   removal of transplanted kidney) admitted with hypertensive urgency with
   headache.
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Patient's blood pressure at [**Company 319**] in the
   180s-190s systolic but up to 240s/130s in the ED. Received labetalol
   with good effect but HR down to 50s. Would hold off on further beta
   blockade due to bradycardia until HR recovers. Though nitroglycerin not
   an ideal choice for IV BP control, cannot safely use beta blocker due
   to HR and not a good candidate for nitroprusside due to renal failure.
   Arterial line placed on arrival to the MICU registering blood pressures
   50 points higher systolic than noninvasive monitoring so therefore
   clearly needs more IV BP control.
   - goal BP 160-190/80-100, lower BP might put patient at risk of
   decreased cerebral perfusion at this point since BP elevated to 240s on
   arrival to the ED
   - Arterial line placed for more invasive HD monitoring
   - attempt PO meds --> hydralazine, lisinopril, & diovan per home
   regimen.
   - up titrate nitroglycerin to obtain goal BP
   - if nitroglycerin unable to obtain BP within goal, consider IV
   enalaprilat (ACEi) though this is not an ideal choice as response is
   not predictable
   - consider early (1st morning) dialysis to assist in blood pressure
   control
   .
   #. Headache: Likely related to blood pressure but could be the case
   that headaches are setting off hypertensive episodes.
   - f/u final head CT read
   - morphine for pain while nauseated, when taking POs switch to PO
   regimen (oxycodone in past)
   - compazine prn for nausea
   - can add tylenol when taking POs
   .
   #. ESRD on HD: Will be due for dialysis on Friday, [**8-16**]. Contact Renal
   to let them know patient admitted and will need dialysis.
   - sevelamer & renal vitamin when taking POs
   - lyte management per renal
   .
   #. FEN - Sips for now, trying to take PO meds. Lyte management per
   renal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted with hypertensive urgency due to extremely high blood pressure readings in the emergency department. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), a heart rate of 63 bpm, a blood pressure ranging from 111/61 mmHg to 236/114 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, indicating acidosis. The complete blood count (CBC) reveals a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 33.8%, platelet (Plt) count of 179 thousand/mm3, and creatinine (Cr) level of 10.3 mg/dL. Other lab values include a troponin-T level of 0.03 ng/mL, glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and elevated serum cortisol levels. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm. 

The patient has been started on intravenous (IV) medications to control his blood pressure, including labetalol and nitroglycerin. His blood pressure goal is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD). He was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. His blood pressure is currently under control after hemodialysis. The patient's recent transplanted kidney was removed, and he is experiencing symptoms such as nausea, pain, and difficulty taking oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage if not managed properly.
2. Headache: The patient's headache could be related to his elevated blood pressure, and if left untreated, it could worsen and potentially cause other complications.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease and reliance on hemodialysis indicate an underlying kidney condition that may have long-term implications for his overall health.
4. Nausea and pain management: The patient's nausea and pain require careful attention to ensure he receives appropriate medications for symptom relief without compromising his kidney function or causing further complications.
5. Difficulty taking oral medications: The patient's inability to tolerate oral medications may indicate an ongoing issue with nausea or gastrointestinal problems, which can affect medication absorption and potentially lead to medication errors or inadequate treatment.
6. Infection risk: The presence of central venous lines and arterial lines increases the risk of infection, particularly bloodstream infections.
7. Fluid balance: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. The patient's blood pressure is currently under control after HD, but there was a dramatic drop with oral calcium channel blocker (CCB). An arterial line has been placed for more invasive HD monitoring. The patient's recent head CT was negative. He is experiencing pain and nausea, for which he has been prescribed morphine or oxycodone and compazine as needed, respectively. The patient is on HD and requires continued renal management. He is also receiving sevelamer and renal vitamins, and his electrolytes are being managed accordingly. The patient's nutritional needs are being met with a renal diet. He is currently on multiple medications including PPI, hep sc tid, and bowel medications as needed. The patient has two peripheral IV lines and a confirmed code status of full code. He is currently admitted to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension, which can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage if not properly managed.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Complications may arise if the HD treatment is inadequate or if the patient develops infections related"

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, with readings up to 170s/100s overnight. Minoxidil was added as per renal recommendation. The patient is also allergic to ciprofloxacin and hydralazine, which caused rash and light-headedness, respectively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/65 mmHg to 182/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 83.7 kg.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine (Cr) levels. Hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), troponin-T, glucose, and other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's arterial line was placed for more invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and he will continue to receive arterial line blood pressure measurements while in the ICU. Nitroglycerin gtt may be used if necessary for goal blood pressure. Consideration for dialysis will be made if needed to assist in blood pressure control. The patient's headache is"

The patient's headache has resolved, and a final head CT was negative for any bleeding. 

The patient is on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday hemodialysis schedule. He is taking sevelamer and renal vitamin, and his electrolyte management is being done per renal recommendations. He is also following a fen hemodialysis diet. 

His bowel medications include hep sc tid, PPI per home regimen, and bowel meds prn. The patient has two peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs) in place. Code status is confirmed as full code. Communication was made with the patient and his wife.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a potential hypertensive crisis. It is important to closely monitor and manage his blood pressure to prevent further complications such as stroke or cardiac events.
2. Renal failure: The patient's history of ESRD suggests ongoing renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and adherence to dialysis schedule are crucial to prevent worsening renal failure.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels (s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. The patient's blood pressure is currently under better control but still shows dramatic and dynamic swings. He has been given back all his home medications, including minoxidil, and the doses are staggered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's history of malignant hypertension and current presentation with dynamic swings in blood pressure indicate ongoing high blood pressure. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or damage to organs like the kidneys.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment. If the dialysis is not properly managed, it may result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, or accumulation of waste products in the body, leading to further deterioration of renal function.
3. Infection risk: The patient's immunocompromised state due to ESRD and medication use increases the risk of infections, particularly in the urinary tract, respiratory tract, or at the site of vascular access for dialysis.
4. Bleeding risk: The patient's elevated PT/INR levels indicate a higher risk of bleeding. Any invasive procedures or traumatic events could potentially lead to excessive bleeding.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and ESRD puts him"
