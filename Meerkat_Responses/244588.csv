","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic cerebral vascular accident, chronic renal failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism. She presents with hypercarbic hypoxemic respiratory failure. The cause of her condition is unclear, but it may be related to arrhythmia, medication/fluid non-compliance, worsening pulmonary hypertension, or a combination of these factors.

The patient has been tolerating bipap well overnight but was taken off it in the morning. Her PCO2 level is high at 79. She has been diuresed with Lasix overnight and metoprolol has been held.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/48 to 133/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on CPAP mode with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, chronic renal failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The cause of this presentation is unclear, possibly due to arrhythmia, medication/fluid noncompliance, worsening pulmonary hypertension, or other factors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of arrhythmias, which can worsen her condition.
2. Medication/Fluid Noncompliance: Noncompliance with medications and fluids can lead to complications such as worsening pulmonary hypertension and fluid overload.
3. Worsening Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pre-existing severe pulmonary hypertension may contribute to her current respiratory failure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can have serious consequences if not managed promptly.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of venous stasis changes suggests a risk of impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or other skin complications.
6. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may impact her ability to handle fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
   color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free
   wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully
   coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No residual interatrial shunting seen. Suprasystemic
   pulmonary hypertension with dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
   Severe tricuspid regurgitation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was transferred to the ICU with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient has been diagnosed with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of heart failure symptoms: Due to the presence of diastolic dysfunction and severe TR, the patient may experience worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and fatigue.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's moderate CHF with bilateral pleural effusions seen on CXR indicates a possibility of pulmonary edema. This can lead to increased respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

3. Right ventricular failure: The markedly dilated right atrium and ventricle, along with moderate global free wall hypokinesis seen on TTE, suggest right ventricular dysfunction. This can result in worsening hypoxemia, low cardiac output, and potential hemodynamic instability.

4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and history of lower extremity erythema raise concerns for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient required intermittent BiPAP and showed improvement with diuresis. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed no evidence of atrial septal defect (ASD), but did show severe tricuspid regurgitation and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxemia/hypercarbia, which is likely multifactorial. This could be due to diastolic heart failure and flash pulmonary edema, as suggested by the worsening dyspnea and moderate congestive heart failure (CHF) seen on the chest X-ray.
2. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
3. Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation: The TTE findings indicate severe tricuspid regurgitation, which may contribute to right-sided heart failure and further compromise the patient's respiratory status.
4. Suprasystemic Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient"

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
   color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free
   wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully
   coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No residual interatrial shunting seen. Suprasystemic
   pulmonary hypertension with dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
   Severe tricuspid regurgitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year old Russian speakin female with hx of Diastolic CHF,
   COPD, OSA, Pulmonary HTN on 6L home O2 who is transferred to the ICU
   with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy.
   # Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: This is likley multifactorial but most likely
   [**12-19**] to known diastolic heart failure and mild flash pulmonary edema.
   CXR shows moderate CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.
   ?consolidation, however, patient has been afebrile and normal WBC which
   makes PNA unlikely.  Plan is for continued diuresis.  Patient now on
   BIPAP with mild improvement in ABG.  CHF team was following on medical
   floor and recommended lasix gtt and to stop Metoprolol to prevent
   hypotension during diuresis.  Cards will interrogate pacer in AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient has been receiving diuretics, bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), and has had an echocardiogram done.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: The patient initially presented with hypoxemia/hypercarbia, which could be due to diastolic heart failure and mild flash pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue diuretics and BIPAP to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and is showing signs of moderate CHF with bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray. Continued diuretic therapy and BIPAP are recommended.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, but it is not currently on Coumadin. The plan is to increase ASA to 325 mg daily and hold Metoprolol as recommended by the cardiology team.
4. Lower Extremity Erythema: The patient has documented lower extremity erythema likely from venous stasis. Monitoring and elevating the legs are advised"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, chronic renal failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism. She presents with hypercarbic hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her fluid status has improved after diuresis and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic hypoxemic respiratory failure, which indicates inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. This condition can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially result in respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation, which can contribute to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. RV dysfunction can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and potentially cardiac arrest.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobility in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, have been initiated to prevent DVT.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung hygiene and infection control measures should be implemented to minimize this risk.
5. Electrolyte imbalance"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral artery disease, hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, chronic renal failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism. She presents with hypercarbic hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has shown improvement in fluid status after diuresis and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular strain and failure, potentially causing further hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
2. Tricuspid Regurgitation: This condition can worsen over time due to increased right ventricular pressure and volume overload, leading to heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
3. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient's OSA may exacerbate her respiratory failure, especially during periods of decreased consciousness or sedation.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's COPD can contribute to her respiratory distress and may require additional interventions such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids.
5. Peripheral Artery Disease: This condition can lead to poor peripheral perfusion and increase the risk of tissue necrosis and non-healing ulcers.
6. Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient's"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 7320**] feels she is breathing better
   today. She continues to decline BiPAP with sleep.

   arousable, Tm of 98.2 BP120/52 HR of 60 RR of [**6-26**] with sats of 88%  on

   bases.
   Labs notable for WBC4.8 K, HCT34.5 , K+4.1 , Cr 1.8 ( 2.0). CXR with

   Agree with plan to diruese ( PO lasix with metolazone) and continue
   diamox for now. This can only help with propensity to complex sleep
   apnea with the generation of mild metabolic acidosis. If she can
   tolerate diuertics today without hypotension, she will transition to
   telemetry with altered thersholds for repeat ICU transfer.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was transferred to the ICU with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy, which is likely due to an acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure and mild flash pulmonary edema. The patient's current condition includes obesity, ruddy complexion, sleepiness, and difficulty breathing. Her vital signs show a temperature of 98.2, blood pressure of 120/52, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 23-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on 6 liters per minute nasal cannula. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.8 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin concentration of 34.5%, potassium level of 4.1 milliequivalents per liter, and creatinine level of 1.8 milligrams per deciliter. The chest X-ray reveals moderate CHF with bilateral pleural effusions and severe cardiomegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of hypoxemia/hypercarbia, lethargy, and difficulty breathing may indicate worsening diastolic heart failure.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 7320**] feels she is breathing better
   today. She continues to decline BiPAP with sleep.
   Exam notable for obese ruddy ccomplexioned woman, sleepy but
   arousable, Tm of 98.2 BP120/52 HR of 60 RR of [**6-26**] with sats of 88%  on
   6 lpm NC O2 . She has resolving edema and improving air entry at both
   bases.
   Labs notable for WBC4.8 K, HCT34.5 , K+4.1 , Cr 1.8 ( 2.0). CXR with
   small lung volumes and massive cardiomegaly.
   Agree with plan to diruese ( PO lasix with metolazone) and continue
   diamox for now. This can only help with propensity to complex sleep
   apnea with the generation of mild metabolic acidosis. If she can
   tolerate diuertics today without hypotension, she will transition to
   telemetry with altered thersholds for repeat ICU transfer.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically and chronically ill

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension. She requires intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support and is being diuresed with symptomatic improvement. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), digoxin, albuterol/atropine nebs, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD, OSA, and hypoxemia/hypercarbia indicates a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's known diastolic CHF may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate diuresis. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure, such as increased dyspnea, edema, or jugular venous distention, is necessary.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of right upper lobe consolidation or mild pulmonary edema on chest X-ray should be monitored for progression. This could indicate worsening heart failure or fluid overload."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and lethargy. The patient has been diagnosed with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions such as CHF, COPD, and OSA.
2. Cardiac Arrest: Given the patient's severe TR and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension, there is a risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has lower extremity erythema, which has been documented in the past and is likely from venous stasis. This increases the risk of developing DVT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions and is receiving various treatments.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 mmHg to 127/66 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 85%. The patient's heart rhythm is paced, and she is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 484 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 194 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.5 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 148 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 2.0 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) level of 40 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 55 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 3.7 mEq/L, and glucose level of 148 mg/dL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal limits, as well as her liver function tests.

The patient's medical history includes diastolic CHF, COPD, OSA, and pulmonary hypertension. She is also taking multiple medications such as Lasix (furosemide), metolazone, digoxin, albuterol/atrovent nebs, diamox, and aspirin.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxemia, exacerbation of CHF, further impairment of skin integrity, and the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization. It is important to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation status, cardiac function, fluid balance, and skin integrity. Additionally, the patient's medication regimen should be carefully managed to optimize her condition."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 7320**] feels she is breathing better
   today. She continues to decline BiPAP with sleep.
   Exam notable for obese ruddy complexioned woman, sleepy but
   arousable, Tm of 97.9 BP120/52 HR of 60 RR of [**6-26**] with sats of 88%  on
   6 lpm NC O2 . She has resolving edema and improving air entry at both
   bases. She is a liter negative with PO diuretics.
   Labs notable for WBC 5 K, HCT 34.3 , K+ 3.7 , Cr  2.0. CXR with small
   lung volumes and massive cardiomegaly but possible improvement in
   effusions
   Agree with plan to diruese ( PO lasix with metolazone) and continue
   diamox for now. This can only help with propensity to complex sleep
   apnea with the generation of mild metabolic acidosis. If she can
   tolerate diuretics today without hypotension, she will transition to
   telemetry with altered thersholds for repeat ICU transfer.
   Alteranatively, she will need to be screened for NH/[**Hospital1 169**] given severe
   medical issues.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, and a previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress or dysfunction. This can be caused by various factors such as CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, or pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary to prevent further complications like hypoxic brain damage or cardiac arrest.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has documented lower extremity erythema, likely from venous stasis. This can lead to the development of pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Regular turning, proper positioning, and elevation of the legs can help prevent further skin breakdown and reduce the risk of DVT.

3. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's history of diastolic CHF increases the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Aggressive diuresis is recommended to manage fluid balance and prevent worsening of CHF symptoms. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload, such as increasing edema and worsening shortness of"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 7320**] feels she is breathing better
   today. She used BiPAp for 3 hrs last night with sleep. She has
   effectively diuresed 1.9 L over past 24 hrs.
   Exam notable for obese ruddy ccomplexioned woman, sleepy but
   arousable, Tm of 98.2 BP120/52 HR of 60 RR of [**6-26**] with sats of 88%  on
   6 lpm NC O2 . She has resolving edema and improving air entry at both
   bases.
   Labs notable for WBC 5.8 K, HCT35.5 , K+3.8 , Cr 2.1( 2.0). CXR with
   small lung volumes and massive cardiomegaly.
   Agree with plan to diruese ( PO lasix with metolazone) and continue
   diamox for now. we will recheck ABG today.  If she can tolerate
   diuertics today without hypotension, she will transition to telemetry
   with altered thresholds for repeat ICU transfer. Disposition is the out
   of hospital setting is the the bigger issue and her PCP ( Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8093**]
   will help along these lines. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy, which were likely caused by an acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure and mild flash pulmonary edema.
- The patient has been diuresed with Lasix IV and metolazone, and will continue with a goal of negative 1L output.
- The patient is also on digoxin at a low dose, BIPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) as needed, and albuterol/atrovent nebs as needed.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation but is not on coumadin due to a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- The patient has lower extremity erythema, which is likely from venous stasis and has been documented in the past.
- The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are at baseline and will be monitored during diuresis.
- The patient has been advised to follow a cardiac heart-healthy diet and restrict fluid intake to 1200ml/day.

","The patient is a 99-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxemia and impaired skin integrity. The patient diuresed about -1.9 L in 24 hours and used bipap for 3 hours overnight. The patient also complains of right-sided abdominal pain this morning. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/43 to 131/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is paced at 60 bpm. The patient's weight is currently 98.8 kg, which is slightly lower than the admission weight of 99.2 kg. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 350 mL in and 50 mL out, resulting in a negative balance of -1,925 mL since 12 AM. The respiratory support indicates the use of CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 212 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and a SpO2 of 90%.

 HYPOXEMIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year old Russian speakin female with hx of Diastolic CHF,
   COPD, OSA, Pulmonary HTN on 6L home O2 who is transferred to the ICU
   with hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy.
   # Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: Mulitifactorial but acute exacerbation requiring
   transfer to the MICU most likely [**12-19**] to known diastolic heart failure
   and mild flash pulmonary edema.  Plan is to continue diuresis.  Will
   change Lasix IV to PO and add metolazone.  Wil cont diamox as this will
   help with generation of mild metabolic acidosis and prevent apneic
   episodes.
   - continue Lasix and diamox with goal 1.5L neg, add metolazone.  Change
   lasix to PO
   - cont digoxin at low doses given renal dysfunction
   - cont BIPAP PRN
   - appreciate Cards recs
   - cont albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN
   # CHF: continue diuresis as above  with goal neg 1.5L . Restart
   metoprolol, will also add digoxin at low dose
   -- appreciate cards recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation: not on coumadin [**12-19**] CVA.
   -- cont  ASA to 325mg daily
   -- cont Metoprolol and digoxin
   # Lower extremity erythema: per medical records, this has been
   documented in the past, likely from venous stasis
   - cont to monitor
   - elevate legs
    .# CRI: Cr at baseline. will monitor in setting of diuresis.
    .# FEN: cardiac heart healthy diet, fluid restriction 1200ml/day

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemia/hypercarbia and lethargy. The patient has been diagnosed with multifactorial hypoxia/hypercarbia, most likely due to known diastolic heart failure and mild flash pulmonary edema. The plan includes continuing diuresis, changing Lasix IV to PO, adding metolazone, continuing diamox, and using BIPAP as needed. Other plans include restarting metoprolol and adding digoxin at low doses, continuing albuterol/atrovent nebs as needed, and appreciating cardiology recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's right-sided abdominal pain and past documentation of lower extremity erythema suggest a risk of impaired skin integrity due to venous stasis.
3. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's diuresis and fluid balance indicate ongoing management of CHF, which may worsen if not appropriately controlled.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's use of BIPAP and need for ongoing respiratory support suggest a risk of"
