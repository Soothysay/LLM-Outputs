   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  82yo woman with dementia, DM, AFib and DVT on coumadin, and
   recurrent infections from cholangitis/UTIs/C Diff presenting with DKA
   in the setting of an unwitnessed fall.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to hypovolemia as dependent on
   staff for fluids and has a history of hypernatremia.  This is probably
   worsened by her hyperglycemia.  There is also a concern for sepsis
   given her leukocytosis, tachycardia.  Sources of infection include UTI
   (positive U/A), cholangitis (though LFTs within her baseline), C diff,
   stage IV sacral decub, ?pneumonia (poss LUL infiltrate, currently
   satting high 90s on RA).  Last echo in [**3-22**] showed preserved systolic
   function but diastolic dysfunction.  Currently warm on exam so unlikely
   to have large cardiogenic component; however, does have STD on EKG, 1st
   set of cardiac enzymes neg.
   - IV fluids as tolerated by respiratory status
   - f/u bcxs, ucxs, check c. diff
   - repeat CXR after hydration if becomes hypoxic (currently satting high
   90s on RA)
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover GI, urinary (h/o resistent e.coli), and skin
   sources
   - Flagyl for empiric C. diff coverage
   - serial CEs, EKG, full dose ASA for now
   .
   # s/p fall:
   Unclear precipitant of fall.  She is very weak with severe arthritis,
   so mechanical fall is a possibility.  Would also consider dehydration
   and/or infection as contributing factors.  Also has STD on EKG, will
   complete ROMI.  1st set of cardiac enzymes are negative.  Likely not to
   be PE given lack of hypoxia, on lovenox bridge for DVT (subtherapeutic
   INR), and no additional troponin leak (within her baseline).
   - IVFs as above
   - infectious work-up as discussed below
   - no bleed on head CT, but will f/u final read of head and C-spine CTs
   as well as pelvis and foot films
   - serial CEs, EKG, full dose ASA for now
   .
   # Diabetic ketoacidosis v. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia:  BS 420 in ED.
   No ketones on U/A but gap of 17, bicarb of 15.  Started on insulin gtt,
   gap now closed.  [**Month (only) 11**] be due to missing insulin dose in setting of
   fall.  Would also consider possibility that she has a brewing infection
   that led to hyperglycemia, which caused dehydration and fall. For
   possible sources of infection, please see below.
   - check pH on ABG
   - insulin gtt until pt's gap has closed and she is tolerating POs
   - follow serial lytes Q6H until gap closed and taking POs
   - aggressive IV fluids as tolerated by respiratory status
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Possible sources of infection include UTI, cholangitis, C diff, stage
   IV sacral decub, ? pneumonia.  She has a h/o drug resistant UTIs as
   well as MRSA.  Alternatively, leukocytosis could be stress reaction in
   setting of recent fall and elevated sugars.  Finally, cardiac ischemia
   can cause elevated glucose and white count.
   - change Foley (has chronic Foley per NH notes)
   - will f/u UCx sent in ED
   - obtain BCx and stool Cx for C diff
   - repeat CXR after hydration if becomes hypoxic (currently satting high
   90s on RA)
   - monitor LFTs given h/o recurrent cholangitis
   - wound care for sacral decub
   .
   # ST depressions on EKG:
   Note that patient has troponin of 0.03 (which appears to be her recent
   baseline) and elevated white cound can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.
   Although she does not c/o chest pain, she is not a reliable historian.
   DDx of her EKG changes includes rate-related demand, cardiac
   ischemia/unstable plaque, or PE.
   - serial EKGs and cardiac enzymes
   - ASA 325 mg
   - consider ECHO
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis:  No ketones on UA.  Mildly elevated lactic acid.
   No uremia.  [**Month (only) 11**] be from starvation.  pH currently normal.
   - cont. to monitor
   .
   # ARF:  baseline Cr 0.7-0.8, current Cr 1.2
   Likely due to dehydration in setting of DKA.  Although she is at risk
   for rhabdomyolysis, her CK was normal in the ED.
   - recheck CK this afternoon to be positive it is not increasing
   - monitor with IVF resuscitation
   - if continues to be elevated, would check urine lytes, sed, eos
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Scalp laceration:
   - s/p repair in the ED
   - will likely need sutures out in 1 week (would review w/ ED staff)
   - Td shot given
   .
   # Left common femoral DVT diagnosed [**3-22**]:
   - continue warfarin for now but could place on heparin gtt if any
   procedures anticipated
   .
   # h/o Hypernatremia/dehydration:
   Recurrent issue because of dementia and water intake.
   - monitor Na [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer and heel ulcer:
   - wound care consult appreciated
   .
   # Recurrent choledocholithiasis/cholangitis s/p ERCPs/Stent:
   Patient has a pigtail placed [**5-31**].
   - follow LFTs and monitor clinical exam
   - has repeat ERCP in [**11-21**]
   .
   # Anemia of chronic disease: baseline Hct 31, current Hct 31.9
   - maintain active type and screen
   - if develops evidence of end organ ischemia, would transfuse for
   threshold of 30; otherwise, would wait until Hct < 21 or actively
   bleeding
   .
   # AFib on coumadin:  Currently in NSR.
   - currently therapeutic on coumadin
   - hold dilt for now given hypotension earlier and sinus rhythm
   .
   # Alzheimer's Dementia: severe, at baseline.
   .
   # FEN:  IVFs; when pt is tolerating [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need diabetic diet with
   pureed diet, nectar thicks, 1:1 assistance, HOB elevated, oral care
   [**Hospital1 **],  aspiration precautions
   # Access:  PIVs
   # PPx:  INR therapeutic on coumadin
   # Comm:  Daughter is [**Name (NI) 5133**], ph: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5134**].
   # Code:  Full Code (confirmed with daughter)
   # Dispo:  medical floor once stable, gap closed, and taking POs

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof multiple medical problems now with traumatic fall and head
   laceration, and evidence for hyperglycemia and possible sepsis
   (hypothermia).
   HYPOTENSION
 Recurrent.  Attributed primarily to hypovolemia and
   sepsis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be component of cardiogenic etiology with ischemic ECG
   abnormalites.  Doubt adrenal insufficiency, GI bleed, or recurrent
   pulmonary emboli.  Plan continue to monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 suspect partially-treated DKA
 plan continue iv
   fluids, insulin.  Monitor glucose, HCO3.  Maintain glucose <150.
   SEPSIS
 hypothermia may in part reflect evolving sepsis, in patient
   with recurrent infections and drug resistent colonization.  Sources may
   include urine, possible C. Diff, or cholangitis (recurrent).  Plan
   continue to monitor, replete fliuds, support , empirical antimicrobials
   pending cultures.  Vanco, Zosyn, Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- Progressive Hct drop.  No clinical evidence for bleed.  No
   evidence for hemolysis.  Monitor stool guiac.  Consider Abd CT if Hct
   continues to fall.  Plan monitor serial Hct, transfuse to Hct >27.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   HYPERNATREMIA -- evolving, likely related to NS resussitation.  Provide
   free H2O.
   A-FIB
 continue to monitor.  Hold Diltiazem --> resume Diltiazem for
   rate control when BP stable.  Hold coumadin.
   FLUID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old individual with multiple medical problems. The patient experienced a traumatic fall and head laceration, as well as evidence of hyperglycemia and possible sepsis (hypothermia). The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has recurrent episodes of hypotension, which can be attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. There is also a possibility of cardiogenic etiology with ischemic ECG abnormalities. Monitoring blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is recommended.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, suggesting partially-treated diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Continuous intravenous fluids and insulin should be administered to manage this condition. Glucose levels, bicarbonate levels, and maintaining glucose below 150 should be monitored.

3. Sepsis: The patient may be experiencing evolving sepsis, possibly due to recurrent infections and drug-resistant colonization. Potential sources include urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile infection, or cholangitis. Close monitoring, fluid repletion, supportive care, and empirical antimicrobials pending cultures are necessary. The current antibiotics being administered include vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is dropping progressively, suggesting anemia. No clinical evidence of bleeding or hem"

","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recurrent infections from cholangitis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypotension after an unwitnessed fall. 

The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension overnight requiring IV fluid boluses. Her blood glucose levels have normalized, but anion gap persists. X-rays confirm no acute fractures, and a CT scan of the head shows no intracranial hemorrhage. 

She has been restarted on coumadin for AFib, but her hemoglobin concentration dropped, so it was discontinued and she received a blood transfusion. 

The patient is currently on various medications including insulin, Vanc/Zosyn to cover gastrointestinal, urinary, and skin sources, and Flagyl for empiric C. diff coverage. 

She has a history of recurrent UTIs, and her urine analysis is positive. Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible sepsis. 

Her blood tests show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate acid, while her albumin level is low. Her calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range. 

The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining oxygen saturation above 90%. 

Regarding potential medical complications, the patient's hypotension may be due to inadequate PO intake, hyperglycemia, sepsis, or acute blood loss. Sepsis is suspected due to leukocytosis, hypotension, and lactic acidosis upon arrival. Urosepsis is considered as the most likely etiology given her positive urine analysis and history of recurrent UTIs. 

The patient is also being treated for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with insulin and dextrose in normal saline (D5NS) infusion to prevent hypoglycemia. 

Additionally, the patient's metabolic acidosis is mixed, with both non-anion gap and anion gap components. 

There are concerns about acute renal failure (ARF), which could be due to dehydration in the setting of DKA. The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7-0.8, but it has increased to 1.2. 

The patient has a scalp laceration that was repaired in the emergency department and is stable. She also has anemia of chronic disease with possible acute blood loss. 

Anticoagulation with coumadin is being held for now due to the possibility of active hemorrhage. The patient's Alzheimer's dementia remains severe and at baseline."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, dementia, and Clostridium difficile infection admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension and potential retroperitoneal/abdominal bleeding. There are concerns about a possible abdominal bleed as evidenced by the CT scan. The patient received 150 mEq sodium bicarbonate bolus to address hypotension, and blood pressures normalized. Stool guaiac charted positive, although the nurse mentioned it as weakly positive, and will re-test. Coumadin was restarted when the patient's condition was stable, and consideration was given to discontinuing Flagyl. The patient's diet was advanced, and various medications including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) were administered. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/43 mmHg to 135/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance data are provided. The patient received respiratory support but did not require supplemental oxygen. Peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination findings are not available. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell"

   # Diabetic ketoacidosis v. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia:  BS 420 in ED
   with no ketones on U/A but gap of 17, bicarb of 15.   Although patient
   only missed one dose of insulin may have had predisposition to DKA

   dehydration and/or infection, acute MI ruled out by serial EKG and
   troponins
   -CT head negative for ICH, but if mental status diminishes have low
   suspicion to rescan given anticoagulation with coumadin
   - Pelvis/ foot, c-spine films negative for acute fracture
   # Metabolic acidosis:  mixed anion and nonanion gap metabolic acidosis
   - nonanion gap acidosis [**1-15**] fluid resuscitation with NS, try to
   continue fluid resuscitation with hypotonic fluids
   - anion gap acidosis: mix of lactic acidosis and DKA, correct
   underlying etiologies

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis on coumadin. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypotension after an unwitnessed fall.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite IV fluid boluses. Possible etiologies include inadequate oral intake exacerbated by fluid loss, hyperglycemia, sepsis, and acute blood loss. The patient may have low blood pressure at baseline.

2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis, hypotension, and lactic acidosis on arrival. The likely etiology is urosepsis given her history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and a positive urine analysis.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has DKA with a blood sugar level of 456 in the emergency department. Although she only missed one dose of insulin, she may have had a predisposition to DKA due to recent infection. She is being maintained on an insulin drip and D5NS until the anion gap closes. Serial electrolytes are being monitored.

4. Fall: The patient had an unwitnessed fall, but no evidence of injury was found. The precipitant of the fall"

   # Hypotension:  most likely multifactorial: possible etiologies
   including inadequate PO intake exaccerbated by fluid loss [**1-15**]
   hyperglycemia, sepsis, acute blood loss
   -responds well to IVF boluses, not requiring pressors
   -concern for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS
   #Sepsis: leukocytosis, hypotension, lactic acidosis on arrival
   -etiology: UTI (positive U/A), cholangitis (though LFTs within her
   baseline), C diff, stage IV sacral decub, ?pneumonia (poss LUL
   infiltrate, currently satting high 90s on RA).  Most likely etiology is
   urosepsis in setting of positive UA and given hx of recurrent UTI
   - IV fluids as tolerated by respiratory status
   - f/u bcxs, ucxs, check c. diff, repeat CXR after hydration if becomes
   hypoxic (currently satting high 90s on RA)
   - monitor LFTs given h/o recurrent cholangitis
   - wound care for sacral decub
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover GI, urinary (h/o resistent e.coli), and skin
   sources
   - Flagyl for empiric C. diff coverage
   # Diabetic ketoacidosis v. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia:  BS 420 in ED.
   No ketones on U/A but gap of 17, bicarb of 15.   Although patient only
   missed one dose of insulin may have had predisposition to DKA given
   recent infection.
   -insulin gtt. until gap closes
   - D5NS infusion to prevent hypoglycemia
   - follow serial lytes Q6H until gap closed and taking POs
   - aggressive IV fluids as tolerated by respiratory status

   -CT head negative for ICH, but if mental status diminishes have low
   suspicion to rescan given anticoagulation with coumadin
   - Pelvis/ foot, c-spine films negative for acute fracture
   # Metabolic acidosis:  mixed anion and nonanion gap metabolic acidosis
   - nonanion gap acidosis [**1-15**] fluid resuscitation with NS, try to
   continue fluid resuscitation with hypotonic fluids
   - anion gap acidosis: mix of lactic acidosis and DKA, correct

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis on coumadin. She presented with hypotension and was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with a blood sugar level of 420 in the emergency department. The patient also has sepsis, leukocytosis, hypotension, and lactic acidosis on arrival. The likely etiology of sepsis is urosepsis due to a positive urinalysis and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial, including inadequate oral intake exacerbated by fluid loss, hyperglycemia, sepsis, and acute blood loss. She responds well to intravenous fluid boluses but does not require pressors.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis, hypotension, and lactic acidosis. The most likely etiology is urosepsis due to a positive urinalysis and a history of recurrent UTIs. She will be given intravenous fluids as tolerated by respiratory status and antibiotics to cover gastrointestinal, urinary, and skin sources.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has DKA with a blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof multiple medical problems now with traumatic fall and head
   laceration, and evidence for hyperglycemia and possible sepsis
   (hypothermia).
   HYPOTENSION
 Recurrent.  Attributed primarily to hypovolemia and
   sepsis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be component of cardiogenic etiology with ischemic ECG
   abnormalites.  Doubt adrenal insufficiency, GI bleed, or recurrent
   pulmonary emboli.  Plan continue to monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 suspect partially-treated DKA
 plan continue iv
   fluids, insulin.  Monitor glucose, HCO3.  Maintain glucose <150.
   SEPSIS
 hypothermia may in part reflect evolving sepsis, in patient
   with recurrent infections and drug resistent colonization.  Sources
   identified as urine (E.coli).  Plan continue to monitor, replete
   fliuds, support , empirical antimicrobials pending cultures.  Adjust
   antimicrobials to zosyn alone (d/c Vanco, Flagyl)
   ANEMIA -- Progressive Hct drop.  No clinical evidence for bleed.  No
   evidence for hemolysis.  Monitor stool guiac.  Consider Abd CT if Hct
   continues to fall.  Plan monitor serial Hct, transfuse to Hct >27.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   HYPERNATREMIA -- evolving, likely related to NS resussitation.  Provide
   free H2O.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA --  replete iv
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv
   A-FIB
 continue to monitor.  Hold Diltiazem --> resume Diltiazem for
   rate control when BP stable.  Resume coumadin.
   FLUID
 hypovolemia.  Replete.  Monitor I/O.
   DVT -- resume coumadin.
   LACERATION

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof multiple medical problems now with traumatic fall and head
   laceration, and evidence for hyperglycemia and possible sepsis
   (hypothermia).
   HYPOTENSION
 Recurrent.  Attributed primarily to hypovolemia and
   sepsis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be component of cardiogenic etiology with ischemic ECG
   abnormalites.  Doubt adrenal insufficiency, GI bleed, or recurrent
   pulmonary emboli.  Plan continue to monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 suspect partially-treated DKA
 plan continue iv
   fluids, insulin.  Monitor glucose, HCO3.  Maintain glucose <150.
   SEPSIS
 hypothermia may in part reflect evolving sepsis, in patient
   with recurrent infections and drug resistent colonization.  Sources
   identified as urine (E.coli).  Plan continue to monitor, replete
   fliuds, support , empirical antimicrobials pending cultures.  Adjust
   antimicrobials to zosyn alone (d/c Vanco, Flagyl)
   ANEMIA -- Progressive Hct drop.  No clinical evidence for bleed.  No
   evidence for hemolysis.  Monitor stool guiac.  Consider Abd CT if Hct
   continues to fall.  Plan monitor serial Hct, transfuse to Hct >27.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   HYPERNATREMIA -- evolving, likely related to NS resussitation.  Provide
   free H2O.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA --  replete iv
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv
   A-FIB
 continue to monitor.  Hold Diltiazem --> resume Diltiazem for
   rate control when BP stable.  Resume coumadin.
   FLUID
 hypovolemia.  Replete.  Monitor I/O.
   DVT -- resume coumadin.
   LACERATION
 s/p suture repair.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with multiple medical problems who presented with a traumatic fall and head laceration. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, hypotension, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, atrial fibrillation, and a laceration that has been sutured.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, such as organ dysfunction or failure, respiratory distress, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion, resulting in organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels can increase the risk of infection, delay wound healing, and contribute to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
4. Anemia: The progressive decrease in hematocrit indicates ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypokalemia: Low potassium levels can result in muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and gastrointestinal disturbances.
6. Hypernat"
