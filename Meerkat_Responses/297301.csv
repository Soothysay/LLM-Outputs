   conversion to sinus tach and initiated on arctic sun cooling protocol.
   .
   # RHYTHM: pt found in VF arrest this morning, down time was briefly for
   a few minutes. He was shocked x1 with conversion to sinus tach. He was
   given 100mg IV lidocaine and amiodarone 150mg bolus, currently 1mg/hr.
   Pt with spontaneous movement prior sedation.  He was initiated on artic
   sun protocol at the OSH and transferred here.  Pt unclear h/o ischemia,
   heart failure, LVH, structural heart disease or prior arrhythmia that
   might have caused his VF arrest.
   -- plan to continue cooling protocol
   -- Cardiac Arrest Team consult and recs
   -- EEG with neuro input
   -- initiate sedation with propofol according to cooling protocol
   -- cont amiodarone at 1mg/hr
   -- q6 hour labs and coags per cooling protocol

   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated in the field after being found
   unresponsive and in VF arrest. CXR at OSH showed pulm edema, but no
   other acute abnormality. He was hypoxic on the EMS ride over with desat
   to 94% that improved with suction. Concern for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs pulm edema.
   -- Repeat CXR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient was found unresponsive and in VF arrest, and was shocked once with conversion to sinus tachycardia. 

The patient has been initiated on the Arctic Sun cooling protocol for therapeutic hypothermia following the VF arrest. He received 100mg IV lidocaine and amiodarone 150mg bolus, and is currently being administered amiodarone at 1mg/hr. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 33.2°C (91.8°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/58mmHg to 133/64mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The assessment and plan include rhythm management, cooling protocol, cardiac arrest team consult, EEG with neuro input, sedation with propofol, continuation of amiodarone, q6 hour labs and coags per cooling protocol, head CT to rule out bleed, monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 60-70, trending central venous pressure (CVP), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray (CXR), placement of arterial line and central venous line, and consideration of cardiac catheterization if signs of ischemia are present. 

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation and a plan to repeat CXR, sedation according to cooling protocol, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, and a-line placement. 

There is also a mention of unclear coronary artery disease, pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema, and leukocytosis. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension is noted. 

Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin, bowel regimen as needed, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

The patient's disposition is currently in the critical care unit (CCU)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presented with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He was resuscitated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival in the ICU, he was started on an Arctic Sun cooling protocol due to suspected cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The patient reached cooling temperature at 10 pm last night. He has been sedated, paralyzed, and on amiodarone for VF arrest. 

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced VF arrest and required resuscitation. This indicates an underlying cardiac issue.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema. This may be secondary to the VF arrest or could be indicative of underlying heart failure.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, likely due to the stress of the cardiac event and the cooling protocol. Insulin gtt was initiated to control blood sugar.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 238 to 126 on admission. This could be due to the cooling process or other factors such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
5. Coronary Event: The patient's cardiac biomarkers (CK, CK-MB, Troponin-T) are elevated, suggesting possible myocardial"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presented with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival, he was found to have diffuse pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and was started on an Arctic Sun cooling protocol for targeted temperature management after VF arrest.

The patient's initial lab results show elevated glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. He was started on an insulin infusion and will continue with the insulin infusion during the cooling protocol. His blood pressure is currently being allowed to autoregulate with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-70.

The patient's platelet count has dropped from 238 to 126, which may be due to cooling-induced thrombocytopenia. A pre-test is intermediate for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), so heparin products are being held, and HIT antibodies are being sent for testing.

The patient's cardiac enzymes (troponin-T, CK-MB, and CK) are elevated, indicating some degree of myocardial injury or ischemia. However, the troponin-T level is relatively low, suggesting that the extent of cardiac damage may be limited.

The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, but his liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) are slightly elevated. His"

   # RHYTHM: pt found in VF arrest, down time was brief for a few minutes.
   He was shocked x1 with conversion to sinus tach.   He was started on
   amiodarone and initiated on artic sun cooling.  He reached cooling temp
   at 10pm last night.  No clear h/o ischemia, heart failure, LVH,
   structural heart disease or prior arrhythmia that might have caused his
   VF arrest.  However, given cardiac risk factors pt likely with
   underlying cardiac disease.
   -- plan to continue cooling protocol for 18hrs
   -- Cardiac Arrest Team consult and recs
   -- EEG with neuro input
   -- cont sedation with fentanyl/ mid and cont paralysis with cis
   -- cont amiodarone at 0.5mg/hr for 18 hrs
   -- q8 hour labs and coags per cooling protocol
   -- allow BP to autoregulate with MAPS 60-70
   -- trend CE
   -- TTE
   -- monitor on tele
   -- will consider cath emergently if signs of ischemia, but will hold
   off until patient stablizes.

   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated in the field after being found
   unresponsive and in VF arrest. CXR showed diffuse pulm edema.  Pt
   ventilation improved with sedation and paralysis and have been able to
   wean O2/PEEP overnight. Pt diuresed overnight with 40mg IV lasix.
   Possible aspiration. Pt with improved leukocytosis. Unable to trend
   fever given cooling.
   -- empirically treat with cefepime and vanco
   -- Repeat CXR this AM
   -- cont sedation and paralysis while on cooling protocol
   -- goal PCO2 35-40 per arrest protocol

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. The patient experienced a return of spontaneous circulation after one shock and was subsequently cooled. 

The patient's current condition includes acute coronary syndrome, type II diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure (not ARDS), cardiac arrest, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The echocardiogram indicates mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild regional and global systolic dysfunction, suggesting possible prior congestive heart failure. 

The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is receiving an insulin drip for tight control. The patient's platelet count has decreased from 238 on admission to 126, which may be related to the cooling process. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and bradycardia, which may be secondary to the sedation. The patient's kidney function is normal based on the serum creatinine level. 

The patient has been placed on systemic anticoagulation with heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the critical care unit (CCU)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina), and respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on multiple medications including insulin, heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, lasix, and famotidine.

Potential medical complications:
1. Prolonged QTc and bradycardia: The patient's prolonged QTc and bradycardia should be monitored closely as these can increase the risk of arrhythmias.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotensive state may require further evaluation and management to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
3. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is important to monitor due to his respiratory failure and potential fluid overload.
4. Respiratory support: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and weaning from the ventilator should be carefully planned based on his respiratory function and readiness.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate the possibility of DKA, which should be managed appropriately with insulin and electrolyte replacement.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections due to his prolonged intubation. Surveillance cultures and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.

   re-warmed last night.  No clear h/o ischemia, heart failure, LVH,
   structural heart disease or prior arrhythmia that might have caused his
   VF arrest.  However, given extensive CAD risk factors, CAD may have
   been the trigger.
   -- degree of consciousness last night re-assuring in terms of
   neurologic recovery

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and recent cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). He presented to the ICU after experiencing VF arrest and was successfully resuscitated with one shock. The patient underwent a cooling protocol and had his amiodarone discontinued due to QT prolongation.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, coronary ischemia, diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure (acute but not ARDS), and cardiac arrest. The patient's past medical history includes extensive coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, no clear history of ischemia, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or prior arrhythmia.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild regional and global systolic dysfunction. There is also mild mitral regurgitation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The troponin T levels are within normal range, but CK and CK-MB levels are elevated. Other lab results show normal kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated LD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and no known history of heart failure or structural heart disease. He presented with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. After the arrest, he underwent a cooling protocol.

The patient has been experiencing substernal chest pain without radiation, which worsens with cough. His EKG remains unchanged. He reports feeling generally unwell but is conversing appropriately. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device.

The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and extubated. He is currently receiving insulin, heparin, famotidine, metoprolol, furosemide, and other medications as per the treatment plan. His laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes, but slightly elevated levels of troponin T and lactate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - The patient's VF arrest and chest pain suggest the possibility of ACS. Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization is planned.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient had acute respiratory failure, possibly"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   67 yo M with DM, HTN presents following VF-arrest s/p shock x1 with
   conversion to sinus. S/p cooling protocol.
   # RHYTHM/ s/p ARREST: VF arrest, down time reportedly few minutes. He
   was shocked x1 with conversion to sinus tach.  S/p cooling protocol.
   Amiodarone d/c
ed per EP recs [**2-27**] QT prolongation.  No clear h/o
   ischemia, heart failure, LVH, structural heart disease or prior
   arrhythmia that might have caused his VF arrest.  However, given
   extensive CAD risk factors, CAD may have been the trigger.
   -- neurologic status at this time very encouraging.
   -- epilepsy service, SCD consult team, and EP continuing to follow
   -- will see if okay with neuro to d/c EEG monitoring.
   -- monitor on tele
   -- cath as below, if no reversible ischemic causes, would pursue ICD
   -- will start metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CORONARIES/ NSTEMI: MB with peak at 156 (CK 736), not definitively
   outside of the range of what could be seen without CAD in setting of
   arrest/shocks. Echo suggestive of diffuse CAD vs LAD distribution;
   degree of cardiac enzymes not high enough to explain this degree of
   injury to LV
suggesting possible prior CHF. That said, ischemia most
   likely trigger for VFIB arrest given risk factors.  This am complains
   of CP.  EKG unchanged.  Possibly MSK secondary to CPR
   -- continue heparin gtt until cath, ASA, lipitor 80, plavix 75
   -- CE have peaked
   -- cath early next week
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Respiratory status improving.  Most likely secondary to
   pulmonary edema.  s/p extubation today.  Feel less likely to be related
   to aspiration PNA or other infectious etiology, but pt continues to
   have thick sputum.  Very unlikely to be [**2-27**] resistant organism.
   -- d/c vanco & cefepime.  Start levofloxacin to complete a 8 day
   course.  (day 1=[**1-17**])
   -- attempt diuresis today if BP allows.  Goal I/O 1L neg.

   # PUMP: Pt with significant pulm edema; No prior known history of HF.
   Fairly non-focal distribution (apical predisposition) to hypokinesis
   with EF 35-40%. Suspect that this is acutely depressed (partially [**2-27**]
   stunning) in setting of arrest and potentially reversible.
   -- start metoprolol as above
   -- start lisinopril at 5mg po daily
   -- I/O goal 1L

   -- restart metoprolol and lisinopril as above.

   #. Thrombocytopenia: Plts 126 down from 238 on admission. Cooling can
   cause thrombocytopenia. Pre-test is intermediate for HIT. Improved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and subsequently underwent cooling protocol. The patient has been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and cardiac arrest. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has evidence of ACS, which may have triggered the VF arrest. He is at risk for further ischemic events.

2. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Type II: The patient has a pre-existing diagnosis of DM type II. His blood glucose levels need to be tightly controlled, and he is currently on an insulin drip.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonitis or pulmonary edema. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and diuretic therapy is ongoing.

4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a VF arrest, which required resuscitation. The cause of the arrest appears to be multifactorial, with ACS being a likely trigger.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 238 on admission to 126. This could be due to cooling protocol or other factors. Platelet monitoring is ongoing.

6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension. His blood pressure needs to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital following a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The VF arrest was successfully defibrillated, and the patient was cooled as part of the post-cardiac arrest care protocol. The patient has been extubated and is now on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. His mental status has been improving.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, coronary ischemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. The ACS is believed to be the trigger for the VF arrest, although there is no clear history of prior ischemia, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, structural heart disease, or prior arrhythmia. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK and troponin-T) are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. An echocardiogram showed diffuse CAD rather than localized to the left anterior descending artery, suggesting possible prior congestive heart failure. The degree of cardiac enzymes does not fully explain the extent of myocardial injury, which may be due to prior CHF or a non-cardiac cause.

The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly secondary to pulmonary edema, which has improved since extubation. His sputum continues to be thick, and he is being treated with levofloxacin for pneumonia. The patient's renal function is impaired, as"

   ischemia, heart failure, LVH, structural heart disease or prior
   arrhythmia that might have caused his VF arrest.  However, given
   extensive CAD risk factors, CAD may have been the trigger. neurologic
   status continues to improve
   - appreciate EP recs
   -- cont metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   -- monitor on tele
   -- cath as below, if no reversible ischemic causes, would pursue ICD
   .
   #. ARF: Pt with Cr of 1.4 this AM. This was following IV lasix and poor

   # CORONARIES/ NSTEMI: MB with peak at 156 (CK 736), not definitively
   outside of the range of what could be seen without CAD in setting of
   arrest/shocks. Echo suggestive of diffuse CAD vs LAD distribution;
   degree of cardiac enzymes not high enough to explain this degree of
   injury to LV suggesting possible prior CHF. That said, ischemia most
   likely trigger for VFIB arrest given risk factors.  This am complains
   of CP.  EKG unchanged.  Possibly MSK secondary to CPR
   -- continue heparin gtt until cath, ASA, lipitor 80, plavix 75

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and subsequently cooled according to the cooling protocol. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), type II diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 22 mmHg.

Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in platelet count. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral rhonchi without any additional abnormalities. Imaging studies include an echocardiogram showing diffuse CAD with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35-40%.

The patient's current plan includes continuing heparin infusion until cardiac catheterization, initiating metoprolol 25mg twice daily"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented to the ICU following a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with subsequent shock. He has shown improvement in his neurological status but still exhibits delirium. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poor glycemic control. His respiratory status has improved, but he still has thick sputum production. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He also has acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to overdiuresis and the addition of ACE inhibitors. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and there are no clear signs of ischemia or structural heart disease. He has diffuse CAD and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35-40%. The patient's platelet count has decreased since admission, which may be due to cooling or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Fibrillation: The patient experienced a VF arrest, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. It is essential to monitor his cardiac rhythm and continue with appropriate antiarrhythmic medication.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating AKI. This could be secondary to overdiuresis or the use"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented to the ICU following a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with successful resuscitation. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors and diffuse CAD on echocardiogram, suggesting prior myocardial infarction. The patient experienced an acute decline in renal function, possibly secondary to overdiuresis and the addition of ACE inhibitors. His respiratory status is improving, but there is evidence of pulmonary edema with coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture. The patient also has mild systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. There are no known prior episodes of heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, or structural heart disease. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including heparin, metoprolol, lipitor, and plavix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine level has risen from 0.7 to 1.7, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This could be due to overdiuresis and the addition of ACE inhibitors.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: Given the patient's history of VF arrest, there is a risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of coag-positive St"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented to the ICU following a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient experienced cardiac arrest, resulting in a shock and conversion to sinus rhythm. He underwent a cooling protocol after the arrest. The patient's neurologic status is improving.

Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm/Post Arrest: The patient experienced a VF arrest with downtime reported to be a few minutes. He was shocked once and converted to sinus tachycardia. A cooling protocol was initiated. Amiodarone was discontinued due to QT prolongation. There is no clear history of ischemia, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, structural heart disease, or prior arrhythmia that could have caused the VF arrest. However, given the extensive coronary artery disease risk factors, CAD may have been the trigger. The patient is being monitored on telemetry, and if no reversible ischemic causes are found, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) will be pursued.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 1.7 this morning. This is most likely secondary to overdiuresis and the addition of ACE inhibitors. Possible causes include pre-renal azotemia versus bilateral renal artery stenosis. The patient will have repeat urinalysis, continue to monitor even for now, encourage oral intake, and receive a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented to the ICU following a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient experienced cardiac arrest and was shocked once with conversion to sinus tachycardia. He underwent cooling protocol and was given amiodarone, which was discontinued due to QT prolongation. The patient's neurologic status is within normal limits.

Medical Complications:
1. VF arrest: The patient experienced a VF arrest, which required defibrillation and subsequent management.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has extensive CAD risk factors, and it is suspected that CAD may have triggered the VF arrest.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has been declining, with an elevated creatinine level. This could be secondary to the use of furosemide and ACE inhibitors. The Foley catheter will be removed today.
4. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's cardiac enzymes showed a peak at 156, indicating a possible NSTEMI. However, the degree of cardiac enzymes is not high enough to explain the extent of injury to the left ventricle, suggesting possible prior congestive heart failure (CHF).
5. Diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD): An echocardiogram revealed diffuse CAD, primarily involving the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has been producing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presented following a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with subsequent shock. He was successfully defibrillated and cooled according to the post-cardiac arrest care protocol. The patient's neurologic status is currently within normal limits. His blood glucose levels are being monitored, and he is receiving insulin as needed. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF), most likely secondary to overdiuresis and the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Renal function is expected to improve with appropriate management. Coronary angiography has revealed diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD), which is believed to be the trigger for the VF arrest. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he initially presented with hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema. He also has a sputum culture positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), for which he has been started on vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 35-40%, suggesting possible acute depression that may be reversible. His thrombocytopenia is stable, but there is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain"
