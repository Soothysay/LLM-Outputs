   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment/Plan: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CHF,
   CAD, hypertension, diverticuli who presents with bleeding.
   1. GI bleeding/hypotension: Tagged RBC scan
   Given history of diverticuli, brisk lower bleed and significant hct
   drop, the most likely cause of bleeding is the sigmoid diverticuli.
   Other potential causes include upper GI source, other colonic sources
   including mass, polyps, etc.  Hypotension likely secondary to the GI
   bleeding as patient has improved and has no other causes for
   hypotension.
   - transfuse 2 U PRBC
   - serial hct
   - tagged RBC scan, if positive will get angiography
   - if angiography will pretreat for allergy
   - colonoscopy once stable from current event
   .
   2. dCHF: Patient with grade II diastolic dysfunction.  Has not had
   event of decompensation in approx 1 year, however with the
   administration of blood products, the patient is at risk for volume
   overload.  Currently without 02 requirement, baseline cxr without signs
   of significant volume overload.  Will transfuse slowly, follow with
   serial exams and consider lasix if patient shows signs of volume
   overload. Will also contact outpatient cardiologist regarding current
   admission.  Unable to be on betablocker secondary to bradycardia and
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] secondary to angioedema.
   - slowly transfuse
   - consider lasix if volume overloaded
   - notify cardiologist
   .
   3. Alkylosis: Appears to be very mild respiratory and metabolic
   alkylosis.  Seems likely to be secondary to hyperventilation in the
   setting of anxiety (respiratory) and hypovolemia (metabolic), both
   disorders very mild.  Will repeat ABG with iCal
   - ABG repeat
   .
   4. Allergy history:  the patient has history of multiple allergies
   including shellfish. Thus will pretreat with solumedrol, benadryl and
   famotidine prior to and angiography procedure as the patient is at
   increased risk and is DNR/I.
   - methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, famotidine prn angiography

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diverticulitis. She presents with bleeding, specifically gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The most likely cause of the bleeding is sigmoid diverticulitis. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with a good response and is currently stable. However, she experienced two episodes of bloody brown rice-colored (BRBPR) this morning and is receiving an additional unit of PRBCs. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has a history of allergies to lisinopril, aspirin, tramadol, NSAIDs, and a known allergy to shellfish. She also has a history of hypothyroidism and osteoporosis, for which she will continue her home medications. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding/hypotension: The patient's history of diverticulitis and the significant drop in hematocrit (Hct) suggest a likely cause of the GI bleeding as mentioned before. If the bleeding continues, it may lead to further hypotension and the need for additional blood transfusions.
2. dCHF: Due to the patient's underlying CHF and the administration of blood products, there is a risk of volume overload. This can potentially lead to decomp"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment/Plan: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CHF,
   CAD, hypertension, diverticuli who presents with bleeding.
   1. GI bleeding/hypotension: Tagged RBC scan
   Given history of diverticuli, brisk lower bleed and significant hct
   drop, the most likely cause of bleeding is the sigmoid diverticuli.
   Other potential causes include upper GI source, other colonic sources
   including mass, polyps, etc.  Hypotension likely secondary to the GI
   bleeding as patient has improved and has no other causes for
   hypotension.
   - transfuse 2 U PRBC
   - serial hct
   - tagged RBC scan, if positive will get angiography
   - if angiography will pretreat for allergy
   - colonoscopy once stable from current event
   .
   2. dCHF: Patient with grade II diastolic dysfunction.  Has not had
   event of decompensation in approx 1 year, however with the
   administration of blood products, the patient is at risk for volume
   overload.  Currently without 02 requirement, baseline cxr without signs
   of significant volume overload.  Will transfuse slowly, follow with
   serial exams and consider lasix if patient shows signs of volume
   overload. Will also contact outpatient cardiologist regarding current
   admission.  Unable to be on betablocker secondary to bradycardia and
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] secondary to angioedema.
   - slowly transfuse
   - consider lasix if volume overloaded
   - notify cardiologist
   .
   3. Alkylosis: Appears to be very mild respiratory and metabolic
   alkylosis.  Seems likely to be secondary to hyperventilation in the
   setting of anxiety (respiratory) and hypovolemia (metabolic), both
   disorders very mild.  Will repeat ABG with iCal
   - ABG repeat
   .
   4. Allergy history:  the patient has history of multiple allergies
   including shellfish. Thus will pretreat with solumedrol, benadryl and
   famotidine prior to and angiography procedure as the patient is at
   increased risk and is DNR/I.
   - methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, famotidine prn angiography
   .
   5. Hypothyroidism- will continue home meds
   .
   6. Osteoporosis:  will continue calcium when taking POs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diverticulitis. She presents with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). She has received 2 units of blood transfusion and is stable overnight. However, she experienced two large episodes of blood product reaction and is receiving an additional unit of red blood cells. The patient has a history of allergies, including angioedema with lisinopril, aspirin, tramadol, NSAIDs, and GI bleeding. She also has hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 154/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her hemoglobin level is low at 8.3 g/dL, and she has received a total of 629 mL of blood products. The patient's abdominal examination reveals positive bowel sounds, soft abdomen, and no tenderness. She has trace bilateral lower extremity edema and warm skin. Her neurologic examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient's initial presentation was GI bleeding, which could be due to a lower GI source such as diverticular disease. Other potential causes include upper GI sources"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diverticulitis. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) on 12/23. The bleeding was initially managed with large volume transfusion and tranexamic acid. However, the patient continued to bleed and required additional transfusion. She has a history of multiple drug allergies, including angioedema with lisinopril, aspirin, tramadol, NSAIDs, and GIB. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has ongoing blood loss. Her hemoglobin levels are low, and she has a decreased hematocrit. She has also developed hypernatremia, which has been treated with dextrose in water (D5W). The patient refused colonoscopy, so a tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan was performed, which was negative for active bleeding. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and transfuse if necessary. A repeat tagged RBC scan will be done today. The patient will be pretreated with steroids, antihistamines, and famotidine before angiography due to her allergy history. Her other medical conditions, such as CHF, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis, will also be managed accordingly. The patient is on a clear liquid diet and is well-controlled in terms of glycemic control. She"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diverticulosis who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient experienced two large episodes of bleeding, and the source of bleeding was not identified through a tagged red blood cell scan. The patient refused a colonoscopy, and further treatment options will be discussed with the patient's son or healthcare proxy.

The patient's current condition is stable, and the following plan of care is in place:
- Monitor hematocrit levels and transfuse if below 30 or if there is evidence of continued bleeding.
- Redo tagged RBC scan if the patient continues to bleed.
- Pretreat for allergies before angiography.
- Continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, switched to oral.
- Follow up with gastrointestinal recommendations.
- Slowly transfuse red blood cells and administer lasix with each unit.
- Consider short-acting blood pressure medication if systolic blood pressure exceeds 160.
- Maintain diet of clears and provide dextrose water (D5W) as needed.
- Replete electrolytes and provide as needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient requires packed red blood cell transfusion due to low hematocrit levels. No further evidence of GI bleed was observed overnight, but melena was present in the morning. The patient has a history of allergies to Lisinopril, Aspirin, Diovan, Ultram, NSAIDs, and angioedema. The patient is currently receiving Pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 155/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows total fluid input and output, with a positive fluid balance. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's ABG results are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and normal cardiovascular examination. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits. Assessment and plan include ongoing ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, appropriate lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prevention, and vertical positioning to prevent ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   GI bleed -- Painless, large volume --> suspect diverticular (h/o
   diverticuolosis), doubt malignancy.  If clinical evidence for recurrent
   bleed --> repeat nuclear tagged RBC scan, possible angio with
   embolization if site identified.  Not surgical candidate.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to lower GI source (suspect diverticular).  s/p
   transfusion. Monitor Hct, transfuse to Hct >28.  Currently received
   total of 5 U PRBC.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending GI evaluation.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic, attributed to blood loss.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 Improved with free water.  Monitor Na, goal to Na<146.
   RENAL -- preserved.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   HTN -- stable.  Monitor BP.
   CHF (diastolic) -- clinically stable.  Monitor while receiving PRBC.

   Assessment and Plan
   GI bleed -- Painless, large volume --> suspect diverticular (h/o
   diverticuolosis), doubt malignancy.  If clinical evidence for recurrent
   bleed --> repeat nuclear tagged RBC scan, possible angio with
   embolization if site identified.  Not surgical candidate.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to lower GI source (suspect diverticular).  s/p
   transfusion. Monitor Hct, transfuse to Hct >28.  Currently received
   total of 5 U PRBC.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending GI evaluation.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic, attributed to blood loss.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 Improved with free water.  Monitor Na, goal to Na<146.
   RENAL -- preserved.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   HTN -- stable.  Monitor BP.
   CHF (diastolic) -- clinically stable.  Monitor while receiving PRBC.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with a chief complaint of GI bleed. They have been receiving packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusions due to low hematocrit levels. The patient has experienced some melena in the morning but no further evidence of GI bleed overnight. The patient has a history of allergies to lisinopril, aspirin, Diovan, Ultram, NSAIDs, and angioedema. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 155/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

During the physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and shows no signs of acute distress. Their eyes, heart, lungs, and peripheral vascular systems are all within normal limits. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. No extremity edema or cyanosis is observed. The patient's neurologic examination reveals that they are attentive, follow simple commands, respond to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, and have purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 106 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 100 mg/dL, and slightly low sodium level of 25 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have a painless, large-volume GI bleed likely due to diverticulosis rather than malignancy. If recurrent bleeding occurs, a nuclear tagged RBC scan may be performed, followed by possible angiography with embolization if a bleeding site is identified. The patient is not a surgical candidate. 

Anemia is attributed to the lower GI source and has been treated with transfusions. Monitoring of hematocrit levels will be done, and transfusion will be given to maintain a hematocrit level above 28. The patient is NPO pending GI evaluation. Hypovolemia is attributed to blood loss, and fluid support will be provided. Hypernatremia has improved with free water administration, and sodium levels will be monitored with a goal to keep sodium below 146 mEq/L. Renal function is preserved, and blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urine output, and electrolyte levels will be monitored. 

Hypertension is stable, and blood pressure will be monitored. Diastolic heart failure is clinically stable, and the patient's condition will be monitored while receiving PRBC transfusions. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment/Plan: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CHF,
   CAD, hypertension, diverticuli who presented [**12-23**] with bleeding.
   1. GI bleeding/hypotension: Tagged RBC scan [**12-23**] negative.  Pt with
   further bleeding [**12-24**]  but refused colonoscopy.  She has a history of
   diverticuli and her presentation is consistent with diverticular bleed
   (painless, large volume).  Pt currently hemodynamically stable but Hct
   not bumping appropriately to transfusion and pt with one maroon stool
   o/n and one melanotic stool this am.
   - Q6 Hct, transfuse for Hct <30 or continued evidence of bleed
   - redo tagged RBC scan today- nuclear notified and will come to eval
   -  if angiography will pretreat for allergy
   - continue PPI (switched to PO)
   - f/u GI recs
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diverticulosis who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient had further bleeding on 12/24 but refused a colonoscopy. She has a history of diverticulosis and her presentation is consistent with a diverticular bleed. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but her hematocrit (Hct) levels are not improving as expected, indicating ongoing bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's Hct levels are not increasing appropriately, suggesting ongoing bleeding. This could lead to further anemia, hypotension, and shock if not promptly addressed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating possible hypotension. This can be due to the ongoing bleeding and fluid shifts. Close monitoring and timely interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, which may lead to fluid overload. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is crucial to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or acute kidney injury.

4. Allergic reactions: The patient has a history of multiple drug allergies, including angioedema with Lisinopril, Diovan, Ultram, NSAIDs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diverticulosis. The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and was admitted to the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include vaginal bleeding during bowel movements, melena, and maroon stool. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been increasing, indicating a possible transfusion or internal bleeding cessation. A nuclear medicine scan showed no abnormalities, ruling out other sources of bleeding.

The patient has a history of allergies to lisinopril, aspirin, Diovan (valsartan), Ultram (tramadol), NSAIDs, and GIB with angioedema. She was previously on ciprofloxacin but received her last dose on 12/26 at 03:30 AM.

The patient is currently on pantoprazole (protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and is also receiving other ICU medications. Her vital signs show sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 52 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 138/42 mmHg to 170/85 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%.

   GI bleed -- Painless, large volume --> suspect diverticular (h/o
   diverticuolosis), doubt malignancy.  Clinically stable.  No further
   clincal evidence for bleed.  Not surgical candidate.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to lower GI source (suspect diverticular).  s/p
   transfusion. Monitor Hct, transfuse to Hct >28.  Currently received
   total of 5 U PRBC.
   UTI
 ciprofloxicin
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending GI evaluation.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic, attributed to blood loss.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 Improved with free water.  Monitor Na, goal to Na<146.
   RENAL -- preserved.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   HTN -- stable.  Monitor BP.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of diverticulosis and is suspected to have a diverticular bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 146/55 mmHg, heart rate of 57 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving fluids and has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there is a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction or injury. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated sodium level of 141 mEq/L.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans to continue ICU care. The patient is not a surgical candidate, and nutritional support is pending GI evaluation. Fluid management is being implemented due to hypovolemia caused by blood loss. The patient's hypernatremia has improved with free water administration, and renal function is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further bleeding, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), and kidney injury or failure. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and response to treatment is essential to prevent and manage"

   Assessment and Plan
   GI bleed -- Painless, large volume --> suspect diverticular (h/o
   diverticuolosis), doubt malignancy.  Clinically stable.  No further
   clincal evidence for bleed.  Not surgical candidate.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to lower GI source (suspect diverticular).  s/p
   transfusion. Monitor Hct, transfuse to Hct >28.  Currently received
   total of 5 U PRBC.
   UTI
 ciprofloxicin
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending GI evaluation.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic, attributed to blood loss.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 Improved with free water.  Monitor Na, goal to Na<146.
   RENAL -- preserved.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   HTN -- stable.  Monitor BP.
   CHF (diastolic) -- clinically stable.  Monitor while receiving PRBC.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's history is obtained from hospital records due to encephalopathy, and they are unable to provide their own history. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, aspirin, Diovan, Ultram, NSAIDs, and antibiotics. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-146/37-55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal pupils without conjunctival pallor or scleral edema. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or additional heart sounds. Respiratory examination is clear with no wheezes or crackles. Extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 101 K/uL, platelet count of 132 K/uL, creatinine of 1."
