   CCU following pericardiocentesis for tamponade.   She was also found to
   also have severe elevations of her PCWP independent of the pericardial
   tamponade.  She has a known history of pancreatic carcinoma and is
   currently on chemotherapy.   This morning, she is much improved
   symptomatically and resting comfortably.  The pericardial fluid was >
   100 cc over the past 24 hrs. We will monitor over the next day with
   removal of the pericardial drain for drainage < 50 cc.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently on chemotherapy. She presented with increasing dyspnea over one week and was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade, which required a pericardial drain. The patient also has subacute renal failure with an increase in creatinine levels, proteinuria in nephrotic range, and evidence of volume overload. Additionally, she is experiencing pulmonary edema, hypertension, anemia with signs of hemolysis, and ongoing management for her pancreatic cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion: The patient's history of pancreatic cancer increases the likelihood of malignant pericardial effusion. Other possible etiologies include infectious causes (viral or tuberculosis) or idiopathic reasons. Monitoring the pulsus, heart rate, and blood pressure is important, along with further studies of pericardial fluid cytology, cultures, and adenosine deaminase levels.

2. Subacute renal failure: The gradual increase in creatinine levels and proteinuria suggest an intrinsic renal process, possibly glomerulonephritis or glomerulopathy. There may also be a pre-renal component due to the pericardial effusion. Holding ACE inhibitors, renal consult, and examining the urine sediment are recommended.

3. Dyspnea/pulmonary edema"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with pancreatic cancer stage IIB who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine. The patient presented with increasing difficulty of breathing over a week and was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade, for which she underwent a pericardial drain.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the progress note include:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer, which could be a possible etiology for the pericardial effusion. Other potential causes include infectious (viral or TB) or idiopathic factors. The patient's pericardial fluid analysis showed elevated white blood cell count with polymorphonuclear predominance, high total protein, low glucose, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Further studies such as pericardial fluid cytology, cultures, adenosine deaminase (associated with TB), and viral serologies are pending.

2. Subacute renal failure: The patient has shown a gradual increase in creatinine over months, from 0.7 to 2.2. The presence of red blood cells and protein in the urine suggests intrinsic renal process like glomerulonephritis or glomerulopathy. There may also be a pre-renal component due to the pericardial effusion. Renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer who has undergone a Whipple procedure, chemotherapy with gemcitabine, and radiation. She presented with increasing dyspnea over one week and was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade. She underwent a pericardial drain and the fluid analysis showed a high white blood cell count with polymorphonuclear predominance, elevated total protein, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but negative Gram stain. Cultures are pending. The patient also has renal failure with an increase in creatinine over months, dyspnea/pulmonary edema, hypertension, anemia, and pancreatic cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pericardial effusion: Possible etiologies include malignant (given history of pancreatic cancer), infectious (viral vs. TB), or idiopathic. The patient is already s/p pericardial drain, but further studies of pericardial fluid cytology, cultures, adenosine deaminase (associated with TB), AFB smear, etc. are pending. Repeat TTE and monitoring of pulsus, HR, and BP are recommended.

2. Renal failure: The patient has subacute renal failure with gradual increase in creatinine to 2.2 from 0.7 in [**Month (only) 1780**]. She is volume"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of pancreatic cancer stage IIB, who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine. She presented with increasing difficulty of breathing over one week and was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade, for which she underwent pericardiocentesis.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in symptoms, but she still has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which could be caused by malignant, infectious, or idiopathic factors. Further evaluation of the pericardial fluid cytology, cultures, and adenosine deaminase levels is pending.

2. Subacute renal failure: The patient has a gradual increase in creatinine levels over months, suggesting subacute renal failure. This could be due to an intrinsic renal process such as glomerulonephritis or glomerulopathy. The presence of RBCs and protein in the urine indicates proteinuria in the nephrotic range. Renal function should be closely monitored, and further investigation into glomerulonephritis serologies is recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient shows signs of hemolysis, indicated by decreased hct, elevated LDH, elevated reticulocyte count, and low"

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer who underwent a Whipple procedure. She is currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine and presents with increasing dyspnea over the past week. The patient was found to have pericardial effusion with early tamponade, which has been treated with pericardiocentesis. 

The patient's condition shows improvement in terms of symptomatic relief. However, she is experiencing acute pain, pericardial effusion (without tamponade), subacute renal failure, dyspnea/pulmonary edema, hypertension, anemia, and pancreatic cancer.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: Although the patient's repeat echo shows no echocardiographic signs of tamponade, there is still a possibility of cardiac tamponade due to the presence of a small pericardial effusion.

2. Infection: The patient's pericardial fluid analysis shows a high white blood cell count with predominantly polymorphonuclear cells. This suggests a possible infectious etiology for the pericardial effusion, such as viral or tuberculosis-related pericarditis. Further investigations, including culture and sensitivity tests, are pending.

3. Malignant pericardial effusion: Given the patient's history of pancreatic cancer, it is important to consider the possibility of malignant involvement in"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer, who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine. She was admitted to the ICU for increasing difficulty breathing over a week and was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis and the pericardial fluid was sent for analysis.

The patient's symptoms have improved since the pericardiocentesis, and she is resting comfortably. The pericardial fluid showed no growth on culture, negative gram stain, and negative acid-fast stain. The patient's pleural fluid also showed no growth on culture. The echocardiogram revealed a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.

The patient has a history of subacute renal failure with gradual increase in creatinine from 0.7 to 2.2 over months. Her urine analysis showed red blood cells and protein, indicating possible intrinsic renal process such as glomerulonephritis or glomerulopathy. Renal serologies were sent for further evaluation.

The patient also has dyspnea and pulmonary edema, which improved after diuresis with IV Lasix. Her blood pressure has been elevated, but is now improved to 130-140s. The patient is currently on amlodipine daily, and lisinopril-HCTZ is being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pancreatic cancer stage IIB, who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently undergoing chemotherapy with gemcitabine. She presented with increasing difficulty of breathing over one week and was found to have pericardial effusion with early tamponade. She underwent a pericardial drain and the pericardial fluid showed WBC count of 500, total protein 3.5, glucose 107, and LDH 120. Gram stain was negative, and cultures are pending. The patient also has subacute renal failure, dyspnea/pulmonary edema, hypertension, anemia, and stage IIB pancreatic cancer. She is currently in the CCU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical intervention.
2. Subacute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has gradually increased over months, indicating a decline in kidney function. This may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient's decreased hematocrit, elevated LDH, elevated reticulocyte count, and low haptoglobin suggest hemolysis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with stage IIB pancreatic cancer, who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with increasing dyspnea over one week and was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis and is now on a pericardial drain. Her condition has improved symptomatically, but the pericardial fluid drainage is still above 100 cc per day. The patient's medical history includes severe elevations of her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) independent of the pericardial tamponade, subacute renal failure with an increase in creatinine from 0.7 to 2.2 over months, proteinuria in nephrotic range, and a history of pancreatic cancer. The patient also has dyspnea/pulmonary edema, hypertension, anemia, and pancreatic cancer. She is currently in the CCU and will be monitored with the removal of the pericardial drain for drainage below 50 cc. Further studies of the pericardial fluid cytology, cultures, adenosine deaminase (associated with TB), AFB smear, and repeat TTE are pending. The patient's renal function will be evaluated with a renal consult, urine analysis, and examination of sediment. The respiratory status improved after diuresis with IV Lasix.

 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (WITHOUT TAMPONADE)
   62 year old female with pancreatic cancer stage IIB s/p Whipple, on
   chemotherapy with gemcitabine presents with increasing DOE over 1 week,
   found to have pericardial effusion with early tamponade, now s/p
   pericardial drain.
   This 62 year old woman was admitted to the CCU following
   pericardiocentesis for tamponade.   She was also found to also have
   severe elevations of her PCWP independent of the pericardial
   tamponade.  She has a known history of pancreatic carcinoma and is
   currently on chemotherapy.   This morning, she is much improved
   symptomatically and resting comfortably.  The pericardial fluid was >
   100 cc over the past 24 hrs. We will monitor over the next day with
   removal of the pericardial drain for drainage < 50 cc.

","Based on the provided physician's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 62-year-old female with pancreatic cancer stage IIB who underwent a Whipple procedure and is currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine.
2. She presented with increasing dyspnea over one week and was found to have pericardial effusion with early tamponade, for which a pericardial drain was performed.
3. The pericardial fluid analysis showed elevated white blood cell count, total protein, glucose, and LDH levels, but no growth on Gram stain. Cultures are pending.
4. The patient was volume-overloaded on admission and required non-rebreather for hypoxia. She has shown significant improvement in respiratory status following diuresis with IV Lasix.
5. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with amlodipine and labetalol, and further monitoring is recommended.
6. The patient has renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 2.2, likely secondary to hemolytic-uremic syndrome related to recent gemcitabine use. Other potential causes, such as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, should be considered.
7. The patient has hemolytic anemia with decreased hematocrit, elevated LDH, and positive schistocytes on manual smear, suggesting microangiopathic hemolytic process.
8. A pulmonary nodule"
