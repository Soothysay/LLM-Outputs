   Assessment and Plan
 81M with septic shock likely from pulmonary source
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as possible source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Currently on Dopamine, Levophed,
   and Vasopressin for BP control.   Patient with a mixed venous sat of
   93.  lactate not drawn on initial labs.  This does not appear
   consistent with acute MI or PE
   - Bolus for CVP < 8
   - Maintain UO > 30 cc/hr
   - Transfuse if Hct < 30 and Mixed venous sat of < 70%
   - Maintain pressors for MAP > 65\
   - Continue Vanc/CTX/Azithromycin for now
   - Legionelle urinary Ag
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - Wean Fi02 as appropriate
   - place A-line
   - Goal pH > 7.20
   Coagulopathy: Need to consider TTP vs DIC.  Likely due to shock liver.
   - Check hemolysis labs
   - transfuse cryo for fibronogen < 100
   - D-dimer likely to be positive
   - Trend LFTs
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   Metabolic Acidosis: likely due to lactic acidosis in setting of shock
   - Will adjust vent setting to appropriately compensate
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and UO > 30 cc/hr and titrate off with Neosynephrine then
   Dopamine then Vasopressin as tolerated. ECHO in am to assess for WMA.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.  Maintain on
   telemetry
   ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF likely due to acute tubular
   necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient with high normal CVP and
   MAPs > 65.
   Hypocalcemia: Possible due to chronic renal failure and pancreatitis
   - Will replete as needed and trend
   Hyperphosphatemia: likely a result of renal failure.
   - Will likely resolve with increased urine output.
   - Will trend
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   - Will discuss nutrition, possibly TPN in am.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 81-year-old male with septic shock likely from a pulmonary source. He has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, coagulopathy, transaminitis, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. The patient is currently on multiple pressors for blood pressure control, and his lactate levels are not available on initial labs. 

The plan includes bolusing for CVP < 8, maintaining urine output > 30 cc/hr, transfusing if Hct < 30 and mixed venous saturation < 70%, maintaining pressors for MAP > 65, continuing antibiotics, ruling out Legionella urinary antigen, following culture data, and ruling out flu.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various parameters such as blood pressure, urine output, electrolyte imbalances, and organ functions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with septic shock likely from a pulmonary source. He has been experiencing hypotension due to poor oral intake and is currently on dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. The patient's mixed venous saturation is at 93% and lactate levels are not available in the initial labs. This suggests that the patient does not appear to have acute myocardial infarction (MI) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary infiltrates, which could be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a metabolic acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation. The FiO2 has been decreased and the rate has been increased.

The patient also has a coagulopathy that needs to be evaluated for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is a need to consider liver dysfunction as well. The patient's transaminase levels are elevated.

The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of shock. Ventilator settings will be adjusted appropriately to compensate.

Cardiovascular assessment shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 29%. The patient is normotensive on neosynephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Blood pressure and"

   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient was treated with vanc/ctx/aztro, since patient is being
   started on CVVH, switching CTX to Zosyn. No need to double cover gram
   negative because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - f/u Legionella urinary Ag
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu, continue droplet precautions in the mean time
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   - will discuss possibility of starting Xirgis (APC), caution given CVVH
   line placement and INR from hepatic synthetic dysfx, CVVH also
   contraindication
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - Goal pH > 7.20
   - patient has metabolic acidosis, from renal failure, not lactic
   acidosis, hyperventilating patient to have compensatory resp alkalosis
   - decreasing FiO2 from 60 and increasing PEEP from 5, patient has ARDS
   criteria with P/F ratio of <200, PEEP will be carefully monitored to
   ensure PEEP does not contribute to hypotension
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   -          CVVH through L femoral line being placed now
   -          Hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Will discuss nutrition, possibly TPN in am.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, elevated WBC counts, pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxic respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's elevated WBC count and infiltrates on CXR suggest ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation leading to respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and hypoalbuminemia, indicating possible hepatic involvement due to sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and metabolic acidosis suggest acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and decreased fibrinogen levels indicate a coagulopathy, possibly due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or shock liver.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and previous history of coronary artery disease (CABG, PCI) increase the risk of cardiac complications.
6. Sepsis-induced hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation may indicate ongoing sepsis-induced hypotension.
7. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's decreased albumin levels may be due to chronic inflammation or malnutrition.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels may be related to pancreatitis or renal dysfunction.
9. Myocardial infarction: Although less likely based on EKG findings, the patient's markedly elevated CK levels raise concern for acute myocardial infarction.

It is important to monitor and manage these potential complications closely to optimize the patient's chances of recovery."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient has been treated with early goal-directed therapy and is currently on dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. His mixed venous saturation is 93%, and he has no urine output despite receiving a total of 14 liters of fluid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock suggests poor perfusion and hypotension. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's elevated WBC count, pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, and initial ABG results indicate hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a metabolic acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation. This may be due to lactic acidosis in the setting of shock.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT/PTT and INR suggest a coagulopathy. This could be due to TTP or DIC, both of which are likely in the context of shock liver.

5. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated LFTs indicate transaminitis, which is likely due to shock liver"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is now experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. They also have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperglycemia.

The vital signs show a stable heart rate (HR) within the normal range, but a low blood pressure (BP) indicating possible hypotension. The respiratory rate (RR) is slightly elevated, and the oxygen saturation (SpO2) is within normal limits. The patient's temperature (Tmax and Tcurrent) is within the normal range.

In terms of fluids, there seems to be an imbalance with total in (6,295 mL) exceeding total out (1,552 mL), indicating fluid overload. The central venous pressure (CVP) is also high at 34 cmH2O, which could be due to fluid overload.

The patient is on multiple medications including dopamine, midazolam, fentanyl, vasopressin, insulin, and norepinephrine. They have been given antibiotics as well.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), high creatinine (Cr), high troponin T, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), high amylase and lipase levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows acidosis with a pH of 7.22, low carbon dioxide"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, and multiple comorbidities who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been unstable with several significant events. The patient's vasopressor requirement decreased, and they were successfully weaned off some pressors, except for vasopressin. The patient's FiO2 was weaned to 50%, indicating improvement in oxygenation. 

However, at 4 am, the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) started decreasing despite receiving two 250 cc boluses and a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit (Hct) of 25. 

The patient's sedation was weaned to fentanyl 30 mcg/hour and midazolam (Versed) 1.5 mg/hour, which showed some improvement as the patient started opening their eyes and intermittently following commands. 

The patient is currently on multiple infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, insulin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), and norepinephrine. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/54 mmHg to 141/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (set at 22), oxygen saturation of 97%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 33.8 mmHg. 

The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, azithromycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 20.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.6 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 104 to 119 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 6.9 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal electrolyte levels (Na+/K+/Cl-). 

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, and multiple comorbidities, and is currently being treated for sepsis, ARDS, and hyperglycemia. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing need for vasopressors and respiratory support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, progression of ARDS, acute kidney injury, hyperglycemic crisis, and further complications related to chronic renal failure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient presented with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hyperglycemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which can worsen due to inadequate perfusion or sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to progressive respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock indicates an ongoing infection, which requires prompt identification and treatment to prevent further complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control, increasing the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and underlying conditions.
6. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's multiple organ dysfunctions, including renal and respiratory failure, put him at risk for developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and potential sepsis increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
 81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient was treated with vanc/ctx/aztro, since patient is being
   started on CVVH, switching CTX to Zosyn. No need to double cover gram
   negative because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - f/u Legionella urinary Ag
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu, continue droplet precautions in the mean time
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   - will discuss possibility of starting Xirgis (APC), caution given CVVH
   line placement and INR from hepatic synthetic dysfx, CVVH also
   contraindication
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - Goal pH > 7.20
   - patient has metabolic acidosis, from renal failure, not lactic
   acidosis, hyperventilating patient to have compensatory resp alkalosis
   - decreasing FiO2 from 60 and increasing PEEP from 5, patient has ARDS
   criteria with P/F ratio of <200, PEEP will be carefully monitored to
   ensure PEEP does not contribute to hypotension
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   -          CVVH through L femoral line being placed now
   -          Hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Will discuss nutrition, possibly TPN in am.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. His APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and is currently on dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/54 mmHg to 98/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient also has an elevated troponin T level.

The patient's physical examination reveals warm extremities, absence of peripheral pulses, symmetric chest expansion, and rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally. The patient is unresponsive and sedated.

The patient's assessment includes septic shock, pneumonia, multiorgan failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, coagulopathy, transaminitis, and acute kidney injury.

 81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn/azytro. No need to double cover gram negative
   because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - increased the dose of azytromycin to 500mg from 250mg
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu, continue droplet precautions in the mean time
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   - will discuss possibility of starting Xirgis (APC), caution given CVVH
   line placement and INR from hepatic synthetic dysfx, CVVH also
   contraindication
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - Goal pH > 7.20
   - patient has metabolic acidosis, from renal failure, not lactic
   acidosis, hyperventilating patient to have compensatory resp alkalosis
   - decreasing FiO2 from 60 and increasing PEEP from 5, patient has ARDS
   criteria with P/F ratio of <200, PEEP will be carefully monitored to
   ensure PEEP does not contribute to hypotension
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   -          CVVH through L femoral line, Cr improving
   -          f/u renal recs
   -          Hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, including an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. His APACHE IV score was 114, with a predicted mortality of 77%. He has been treated with dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. The patient's mixed venous saturation is 93%, and he has no urine output despite receiving a total of 14 liters of fluid. He is on vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin. Cultures are pending, and he remains on droplet precautions. The patient's sedation will be weaned, and he will be evaluated for the possibility of starting CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient is currently being treated for septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring his blood pressure and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has elevated WBC counts and pulmonary infiltrates, suggesting a possible respiratory infection. Given the patient's current respiratory failure and the presence of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), it is crucial to optimize oxygen delivery while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury."

 81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn/azytro. No need to double cover gram negative
   because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - increased the dose of azytromycin to 500mg from 250mg
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu, continue droplet precautions in the mean time
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   - will discuss possibility of starting Xirgis (APC), caution given CVVH
   line placement and INR from hepatic synthetic dysfx, CVVH also
   contraindication
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - Goal pH > 7.20
   - patient has metabolic acidosis, from renal failure, not lactic
   acidosis, hyperventilating patient to have compensatory resp alkalosis
   - decreasing FiO2 from 60 and increasing PEEP from 5, patient has ARDS
   criteria with P/F ratio of <200, PEEP will be carefully monitored to
   ensure PEEP does not contribute to hypotension
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   -          CVVH through L femoral line, Cr improving

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, presenting with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114, with a predicted mortality of 77%. He is on vanc/zosyn/azytro antibiotics, and his mixed venous saturation is 93%. Despite receiving a total of 14 liters of fluid, the patient continues to have no urine output.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to pneumonia as the probable source, along with concurrent hypovolemia caused by poor oral intake. He has been treated with River's Early Goal Directed Therapy.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infiltrates. He has an elevated WBC count and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting the possibility of ARDS. The initial ABG results indicate metabolic acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient is showing signs of coagulopathy, most likely due to shock liver. Platelet counts are stable, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

4. Transaminitis: The patient is exhibiting transaminitis,"

   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn/azytro. No need to double cover gram negative
   because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu, continue droplet precautions in the mean time
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - decreasing fFiO2 to 50
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - there appears to be an element of septic cholestatis
   - RUQ u/s today
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Still not making urine
   -          CVVH through L femoral line, Cr improving
   -          f/u renal recs
   -          Hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, presenting with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. He has a low ejection fraction of 30% and is currently on dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. The patient's mixed venous saturation is 93%, and he has no urine output despite receiving a total of 14 liters of fluid. He is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. 

The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary infiltrates, and there are concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His initial arterial blood gas (ABG) indicates metabolic acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation. His coagulation profile shows elevated liver enzymes but stable platelet count, suggesting a possible ""shock liver."" 

The patient also has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lipase, indicating possible muscle injury and pancreatitis, respectively. His cardiac function is compromised, with a low ejection fraction (EF) of 29%, and he is being managed for cardiogenic shock. 

Additionally, the patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis. He is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) through the left femoral line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and acute kidney injury. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation, as well as vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability. The patient also has a history of malnutrition and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of corticosteroids may predispose him to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Dialysis complications: The patient's chronic renal failure requires dialysis, which carries its own risks such as hypotension, infection, or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) progression: Continued inflammation and damage to the lungs can lead to worsening respiratory function and potential need for extr"

   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn/azytro. No need to double cover gram negative
   because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - increased the dose of azytromycin to 500mg from 250mg
   - Follow culture data
   - r/o flu, continue droplet precautions in the mean time
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   - will discuss possibility of starting Xirgis (APC), caution given CVVH
   line placement and INR from hepatic synthetic dysfx, CVVH also
   contraindication
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - Goal pH > 7.20
   - patient has metabolic acidosis, from renal failure, not lactic
   acidosis, hyperventilating patient to have compensatory resp alkalosis
   - decreasing FiO2 from 60 and increasing PEEP from 5, patient has ARDS
   criteria with P/F ratio of <200, PEEP will be carefully monitored to
   ensure PEEP does not contribute to hypotension
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   -          CVVH through L femoral line, Cr improving
   -          f/u renal recs

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114, indicating a high severity of illness and a predicted mortality rate of 77%. He has been receiving dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. The patient's mixed venous saturation is at 93%, and he has no urine output despite receiving a total of 14 liters of fluids so far.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient's condition suggests septic shock, which is likely due to pneumonia as the probable source. This is supported by the presence of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs on sputum culture.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's elevated WBC count and pulmonary infiltrates on CXR indicate hypoxic respiratory failure. This may be due to ARDS, as suggested by the CXR findings and an initial ABG showing a metabolic acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy due to shock liver, but platelet counts are stable, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Transaminitis: The patient likely has transaminitis due to shock liver in the setting of distributive shock"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, chronic renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and suspected cholangitis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing hypotension requiring vasopressors, and an inability to wean off them. The patient remains anuric and is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). He has dilated common bile duct (CBD) measuring up to 15 mm, likely due to cholangitis. The patient is also experiencing malnutrition, hyperglycemia, and requires aggressive glycemic control. He is on mechanical ventilation in the prone position and has been receiving various antibiotics for his infection. The patient's neurologic examination shows inconsistent responses to commands, indicating potential brain dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis is a critical condition that can lead to multiple organ failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS puts him at risk for worsening respiratory function and potential ventilator-associated complications.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's chronic renal failure may progress if not managed properly, leading to further deterioration of renal function.
4. Cholangitis: The patient's dilated CBD suggests an underlying biliary tract infection, which, if left untreated, can lead to septic shock and multi"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. Here are some potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, which indicates an ongoing infection in the body. This could potentially lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of worsening respiratory function or developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may worsen due to factors like sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications.

4. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to inadequate nutritional intake, which can impair wound healing, immune function, and overall recovery.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections, delayed wound healing, and other complications.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT and PTT values, suggesting impaired blood clotting function. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

7. Hepatic dysfunction: Abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST) and low albumin levels suggest possible liver dysfunction. This may be related to the underlying condition or as a result of"

The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, an ejection fraction of 30%, who presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/44-142/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, and abnormal coagulation profile. He has been diagnosed with septic shock due to pneumonia as the probable source, along with hypovolemia caused by poor oral intake. He has also been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease with previous CABG and multiple PCI procedures. He has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 29% and is normotensive on dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin for blood pressure control. He also has a history of atrial"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and hypotension. The patient requires vasopressors, oxygenation is marginally improved, and they are still on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Liver function tests are improving, but there is common bile duct dilatation seen on RUQ ultrasound. The white blood cell count is significantly elevated at 50,000.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102-142 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, unable to provide a medical history.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,406 mL and output of 4,020 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 614 mL. The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation, with set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 250, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide ("

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers goals of
   care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of > 70%. Patient
   is positive 13L of fluid so far, continues to be oliguric.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn/azytro. No need to double cover gram negative
   because of low prob pseudomonas
   - Follow culture data
   - off of pressors
   - in the setting of worsening leukocytosis [**3-21**] c. diff sent -> neg
   - will consider pan-scan for abdominal or other source this afternoon,
   although leukocytosis improving since yesterday
   - f/u ID recs
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0
   - placed A-line
   - changed to PSV
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -checking coags Q8H -> PTT increasing, INR stable, Platelets overall
   down
   -consider peripheral smear, repeat fibrinogen for ?DIC
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, Tbili increasing, others improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Still not making urine
   -          CVVH through L femoral line, Cr improving
   -          f/u renal recs
   -          Hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis
   -          Volume status, patient appears to be somewhat vol down, will
   give bicarb bc met acidosis, low CVP, 5, will monitor
   -          No volume loss from stool, patient does not have diarrhea
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Will start trophic feeds, will check residuals in case of
   ileus, better bowel sounds today
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube, cont insulin drip, will
   monitor lipase
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI IV
   Family
 , family understands prognosis, patient has documented

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, and multiorgan failure.
- He was treated with River Early Goal Directed Therapy and received fluid resuscitation due to poor oral intake and hypovolemia.
- The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. He tested negative for Legionella urinary antigen and had gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs on sputum culture.
- The patient's goals of care include CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, and mixed venous saturation of >70%. He received vancomycin, azithromycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.
- The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing leukocytosis and improving respiratory status. However, he remains oliguric and requires CVVH through the L femoral line, which has improved his creatinine levels.
- Other issues include hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis, transaminitis likely due to shock liver, and an elevated CK level.
- The patient's rhythm is CHB with a DDD pacemaker and an ICD implanted in [**2160**]. He is not on warfarin.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers goals of
   care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of > 70%. Patient
   is positive 13L of fluid so far, continues to be oliguric.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn. No need to double cover gram negative because
   of low prob pseudomonas
   - Follow culture data
   - off of pressors
   - in the setting of worsening leukocytosis [**3-21**] c. diff sent -> neg
   - f/u ID recs
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   Mental Status: Could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and decreased
   metabolism of sedatives.  Also likely [**3-16**] cerebral hypoperfusion on
   initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -checking coags Q8H -> PTT increasing, INR stable, Platelets overall
   down
   -consider peripheral smear, repeat fibrinogen for ?DIC
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Still not making urine
   -          CVVH through L femoral line stopped, Cr now 1.6
   -          f/u renal recs
   -          continues to be oliguric, will monitor
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Will start trophic feeds, will check residuals in case of
   ileus
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI IV
   Family
 , family understands prognosis, patient has documented
   advanced directives
   - will reassess goals of care PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient has been treated with early goal-directed therapy and is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, oliguria, hypoalbuminemia, acute kidney injury, and hypoalbuminemia. He is also experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary infiltrates, which may suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's mental status is impaired, possibly due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery and multiple PCI procedures. His rhythm is currently chaotic atrial fibrillation, and he has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). 

Other findings include elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated cardiac enzymes such as CK and troponin-T. The patient's platelet count is stable, but there is an increasing trend in PTT. 

The plan of care includes continuing with the current antibiotic regimen, closely monitoring culture data, and considering peripheral smear and repeat fibrinogen for possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient will continue to be monitored for mental status improvement, and lactulose will be given for liver function.

   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   Currently on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin for BP control.
   Patient with a mixed venous sat of 93.  lactate not drawn on initial
   labs.  This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers
   goals of care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of < 70%.
   Patient has been given total of 14L of fluid so far, continues to have
   no urine output.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn/azytro. No need to double cover gram negative
   because of low prob pseudomonas.
   - Follow culture data
   - will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to maintain MAP >60,
   decrease in PEEP has improved pressors
   - goal is to decrease sedation
   - in the setting of worsening leukocytosis, will send diff and will
   send for cdiff
   - will continue to decrease sedation, will consider pan-scan for
   abdominal or other source this afternoon
   - f/u ID recs
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Initial ABG on 16*500  fi02 100%  7.08/45/89/14 suggestive
   of a metabolica acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Will increase rate and decrease tidal volume.  Also decrease FiO2.
   - placed A-line
   - decreasing fFiO2 to 50
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -          Trend LFTs, improving
   -          - Given CVVH, checking coags Q8H
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   - Trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Normotensive on Neosynephrine, Dopamine & Vasopressin.
   Keep MAP > 65 and titrate off with Neosynephrine then Dopamine then
   Vasopressin as tolerated.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Will continue to wean pressors as tolerated to MAP >60
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Still not making urine
   -          CVVH through L femoral line, Cr improving
   -          f/u renal recs
   -          Hypocalcemia worsened by pancreatitis
   -          Volume status, patient appears to be somewhat vol down, will
   give bicarb bc met acidosis, low CVP, 5, will monitor
   -          No volume loss from stool, patient does not have diarrhea
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Will start trophic feeds, will check residuals in case of
   ileus, better bowel sounds today
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube, cont insulin drip, will
   monitor lipase
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI IV

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease (EF 30%) who presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient's condition is critical, with an APACHE IV score of 114 and predicted mortality of 77%. 

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia, with a blood pressure ranging from 56-105 mmHg and a heart rate between 60-102 bpm. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 92% through mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (55.5 K/uL), high creatinine levels (1.4-1.6 mg/dL), and liver enzyme abnormalities (ALT/AST: 274/237). The patient also has elevated lactate levels (1.5 mmol/L) and evidence of renal dysfunction with anuria and acute kidney injury.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals pulmonary infiltrates, which may suggest ARDS. The abdominal ultrasound shows known CBD dilation, likely secondary to cholecystitis.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, with previous CABG surgery and multiple PCI procedures. There is also a history of congestive heart failure, as indicated by an ejection fraction of 29%.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Azithromycin, Piperacillin"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions including vasopressors, CVVH, and ventilator support. There have been fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels throughout the day. The patient's temperature spiked to 101 rectally, and cultures were obtained.

The patient's allergies include cholestyramine, niacin, iodine, ciprofloxacin, and muscle weakness. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, azithromycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion for pain control, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. Other medications include vivonex for nutrition and glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 56 to 165 mmHg, heart rate between 60 and 102 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 18 and 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, with set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 24, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 78.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers goals of
   care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of > 70%. Patient
   is positive 13L of fluid so far, continues to be oliguric.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn. Completed course of azytromycin.
   - Follow culture data
   - off of pressors
   - in the setting of worsening leukocytosis [**3-21**] c. diff sent -> neg
   - f/u ID recs
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   Mental Status: Could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and decreased
   metabolism of sedatives.  Also likely [**3-16**] cerebral hypoperfusion on
   initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -checking coags Q8H -> PTT increasing, INR stable, Platelets overall
   down
   -consider peripheral smear, repeat fibrinogen for ?DIC
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Urine output started, 200 cc/ 24 hr, patient off CVVH through L femoral
   line. Now getting dialysis thru that line. Renal recs to place tunneled
   IJ electively through IR once 24 hours afebrile.
   - now doing 20-30cc/hr urine output
   - f/u renal recs
   Resp Alkalosis
 primary uncompensated, patient overbreathing vent
   - will monitor ABG
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr, at goal
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI PO
   Family
 , family understands prognosis, patient has documented
   advanced directives
   - will watch for mental status improvement over the next few days given
   decreased sedation metabolism secondary to hepatic dysfx

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and multiorgan failure. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. He tested negative for Legionella urinary antigen and his sputum culture showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient's initial treatment included receiving fluids according to the Rivers Early Goal Directed Therapy protocol. He was also started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and completed a course of azithromycin. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has elevated white blood cell counts and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the FiO2 is being decreased as tolerated.

2. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status may be due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives. It could also be a result of cerebral hypoperfusion on initial presentation. Monitoring and adjusting sedation levels are recommended.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy likely secondary to shock liver. His platelets are stable, but there is an increasing PTT, indicating the need for further investigation, such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished male in the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and requires small doses of Ativan for tachypnea. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 130/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and laboratory findings may indicate an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms is necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and diffuse lung infiltrates on imaging could suggest the development of ARDS. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation support should be provided, along with careful monitoring of lung function.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure is evident from elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Monitoring fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function parameters is crucial.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's altered mental status and reduced oral intake may contribute to malnutrition. Nutritional"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers goals of
   care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of > 70%. Patient
   is positive 13L of fluid so far, continues to be oliguric.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn. No need to double cover gram negative because
   of low prob pseudomonas
   - Follow culture data
   - off of pressors
   - in the setting of worsening leukocytosis [**3-21**] c. diff sent -> neg
   - f/u ID recs
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   Mental Status: Could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and decreased
   metabolism of sedatives.  Also likely [**3-16**] cerebral hypoperfusion on
   initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.

The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. The patient has been treated with early goal-directed therapy according to the Rivers protocol. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, oliguria, hypoxia, mental status changes, coagulopathy, transaminitis, and acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG and PCI, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient is on multiple medications including statins, beta-blockers (BB), and antiarrhythmics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 130/59 mmHg, heart rate of 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a ventilator. The patient's physical examination reveals warm skin, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchi bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated troponin T, and other abnormalities. Imaging studies show pulmonary infiltrates consistent"

   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs.
   This does not appear consistent with acute MI or PE. Rivers goals of
   care are CVP 8-12, Hct 30, MAP >60, Mixed venous sat of > 70%. Patient
   is positive 13L of fluid so far, continues to be oliguric.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn. Completed course of azytromycin.
   - Follow culture data
   - off of pressors
   - in the setting of worsening leukocytosis [**3-21**] c. diff sent -> neg
   - f/u ID recs
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   Mental Status: Could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and decreased
   metabolism of sedatives.  Also likely [**3-16**] cerebral hypoperfusion on
   initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -checking coags Q8H -> PTT increasing, INR stable, Platelets overall
   down
   -consider peripheral smear, repeat fibrinogen for ?DIC
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is experiencing several acute issues.

1. The patient has an altered mental status, which is not delirium. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or organ dysfunction.
2. The patient is malnourished, as indicated by the low albumin level and the initiation of Vivonex (Full) nutrition support.
3. The patient has hyperglycemia, with glucose levels ranging from 79 to 117 mg/dL.
4. The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is accompanied by organ dysfunction. This could be suggested by the presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and abnormal laboratory values.
5. The patient has chronic renal failure, indicated by the decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as elevated creatinine levels.
6. The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of low oxygen saturation despite being on supplemental oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, progression of ARDS leading to further respiratory distress, development of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections, and potential complications related to prolonged sedation and immobility."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, ARDS, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple events overnight. These include the removal of a hemodialysis catheter due to patient coughing, completion of a course of azithromycin, initiation of codeine for dialysis-induced cough, and restarting of propofol sedation for a respiratory rate in the 40s not responding to small doses of versed. The patient is currently experiencing a fever of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of ARDS. This condition can result in impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may be further compromised due to the ongoing sepsis and other factors. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Proper glycemic control is necessary to prevent complications associated with high blood sugar levels.
5. Malnutrition: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume resuscitated and came off
   pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of azytromycin.  C diff negative, no
   diarrhea.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn today [**9-25**].
   .
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   Mental Status: Could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and decreased
   metabolism of sedatives.  Also likely [**3-16**] cerebral hypoperfusion on
   initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   - will consider for head CT tomorrow
   - currently light sedation with propofol
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -checking coags Q8H -> PTT increasing, INR stable, Platelets overall
   down
   -consider peripheral smear, repeat fibrinogen for ?DIC
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Urine output started, 200 cc/ 24 hr, patient off CVVH through L femoral
   line. Now getting dialysis thru that line. Renal recs to place tunneled
   IJ electively through IR once 24 hours afebrile.
   - now doing 20-30cc/hr urine output
   - f/u renal recs
   Resp Alkalosis
 primary uncompensated, patient overbreathing vent
   - will monitor ABG
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr, at goal
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI PO
   Family
 , family understands prognosis, patient has documented
   advanced directives
   - will watch for mental status improvement over the next few days given
   decreased sedation metabolism secondary to hepatic dysfx
   - needs family mtg since mental status is not the limiting factor,
   continues to have pulmonary and renal failure and patient may require
   prolonged intubation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, but continues to have hypoxic respiratory failure and acute kidney injury.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.

3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can predispose the patient to stress ulcers.

4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and pulmonary infiltrates suggest a possibility of ARDS.

5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating potential hepatic dysfunction, which could lead to hepatic encephalopathy.

6. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated cardiac markers and a history of coronary artery disease increase the risk of myocardial infarction.

7. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury and requires dialysis, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction.

8. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial"

The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 03/23/23 at 11:00 PM and 03/24/23 at 12:14 AM. They have received a course of azithromycin, completed on 03/23/23. The patient is currently on propofol sedation due to a respiratory rate in the 40s that is not responding to small doses of versed.

The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are all documented in the flow sheet data as of 03/24/23 at 07:40 AM. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Cr), total CO2 (TCO2), blood glucose, and lactate levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube, insulin for glycemic control, and dialysis catheter for renal support.

- Patient's temperature is 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Discussion with family regarding patient's prognosis and worsening hypoxic respiratory failure.
- Patient's mental status has not improved significantly.
- Family's wishes to avoid prolonged ventilator dependency and prioritize independent quality of life.

- If there is no improvement in respiratory status and mental status within 24-36 hours, family plans to proceed with Comfort Measures Only (CMO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's condition is worsening, indicating a potential risk of prolonged respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The fever could be indicative of an underlying infection, which needs to be managed promptly.
3. Organ dysfunction: The presence of hepatic toxicity allergy suggests a potential risk for organ dysfunction, particularly liver dysfunction.
4. Drug allergies: The patient has documented allergies to certain medications, including cholestyramine, niacin, iodine, ciprofloxacin, and others. These allergies need to be considered when prescribing future medications.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilator dependency, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection commonly seen in ICU patients on mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving propofol for sedation, and has multiple IV lines in place. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 109/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, increased creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a mixed acid-base disorder. The patient's physical examination reveals poor peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic status not assessed. The patient is expected to have a discussion about prognosis with the family tomorrow, and a CT head has been deferred for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and organ dysfunction suggest ongoing infection and sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on imaging."

   strongly emphasized that he would wish to have an independent quality

   shown any signs of improvement in respiratory status and mental status,

","The patient is a 64-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 102.3°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/54 to 134/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including renal replacement therapy, administration of antibiotics, and insertion of a multi-lumen central venous catheter and dialysis catheter. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's family has expressed their wishes for him to maintain an independent quality of life and has made him do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of current care.

   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume resuscitated and came off
   pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of azytromycin.  C diff negative, no
   diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9 days but now grew out gram negative
   rods concerning for VAP, in the setting of leukocytosis and continued
   spiking.
   -          Patient on vanc [**10-26**], started on tobramycin and meropenem,
   d/c zosyn.
   -          Called lab, pending speciation and sensitivities

   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - will measure dead space today
   Mental Status: improving, could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   - will consider for head CT tomorrow
   - currently light sedation with propofol
   Coagulopathy: improving, due to shock liver, platlets stable, no
   evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive

   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.

   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Urine output started, 200 cc/ 24 hr, patient off CVVH through L femoral
   line. Now getting dialysis thru that line. Renal recs to place tunneled
   IJ electively through IR once 24 hours afebrile.

   - will watch for mental status improvement over the next few days given
   decreased sedation metabolism secondary to hepatic dysfx
   - needs family mtg since mental status is not the limiting factor,
   continues to have pulmonary and renal failure and patient may require
   prolonged intubation

   I had an extensive discussion with family regarding Mr. [**Known lastname **]
   prognosis and current development of worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Furthermore, he has not made much progress in terms of mental
   status. The family has always made it very clear that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would
   not wish to remain in a prolonged state of being vent dependent. The
   strongly emphasized that he would wish to have an independent quality
   of life over duration. At this point, the family has made him DNR with
   no further escalation of current care. If after 24-36 hrs he has not
   shown any signs of improvement in respiratory status and mental status,
   then they would proceed with CMO. - [**Doctor First Name 343**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114, indicating a high risk of mortality, and his predicted mortality was 77%. He has been treated with antibiotics, including azithromycin, and has completed a course of therapy. However, the patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been switched to a different antibiotic regimen. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary infiltrates. The patient's mental status has been improving, but he remains sedated with propofol. He has coagulopathy and transaminitis, which are likely due to shock liver. His cardiac function is compromised, with an ejection fraction of 29%, and he has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with previous CABG and PCI procedures. The patient has chronic renal failure (ARF) and is receiving dialysis. He also has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely secondary to sepsis. The patient's family has made him do not resuscitate (DNR) status and has indicated that they would prefer to withdraw care if there is no improvement in his respiratory and mental status within 24-36 hours.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock, CAP PNA and
   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume resuscitated and came off
   pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of azytromycin.  C diff negative, no
   diarrhea.
   - Patient on vanc/zosyn today [**9-25**].
   .
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   Mental Status: Could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and decreased
   metabolism of sedatives.  Also likely [**3-16**] cerebral hypoperfusion on
   initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   - will consider for head CT tomorrow
   - currently light sedation with propofol
   Coagulopathy: due to shock liver, platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   -checking coags Q8H -> PTT increasing, INR stable, Platelets overall
   down
   -consider peripheral smear, repeat fibrinogen for ?DIC
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Urine output started, 200 cc/ 24 hr, patient off CVVH through L femoral
   line. Now getting dialysis thru that line. Renal recs to place tunneled
   IJ electively through IR once 24 hours afebrile.
   - now doing 20-30cc/hr urine output
   - f/u renal recs
   Resp Alkalosis
 primary uncompensated, patient overbreathing vent
   - will monitor ABG
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr, at goal
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI PO
   Family
 , family understands prognosis, patient has documented
   advanced directives
   - will watch for mental status improvement over the next few days given
   decreased sedation metabolism secondary to hepatic dysfx
   - needs family mtg since mental status is not the limiting factor,
   continues to have pulmonary and renal failure and patient may require
   prolonged intubation
   - SW c/s completed
   I had an extensive discussion with family regarding Mr. [**Known lastname **]
   prognosis and current development of worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Furthermore, he has not made much progress in terms of mental
   status. The family has always made it very clear that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would
   not wish to remain in a prolonged state of being vent dependent. The
   strongly emphasized that he would wish to have an independent quality
   of life over duration. At this point, the family has made him DNR with
   no further escalation of current care. If after 24-36 hrs he has not
   shown any signs of improvement in respiratory status and mental status,
   then they would proceed with CMO. - [**Doctor First Name 343**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. He was treated with early goal-directed therapy and completed a course of azithromycin. He is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn.

The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary infiltrates and ARDS. He is on PSV with decreasing FiO2 as tolerated. Mental status could be due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives, as well as possible cerebral hypoperfusion on initial presentation. Coagulopathy is suspected due to shock liver, but platelets are stable with no evidence of DIC. Transaminitis is likely due to shock liver in the setting of distributive shock with decreased EF. RUQ ultrasound shows known CBD dilation, which was previously addressed.

The patient's CV status does not appear to be ACS, although CK is markedly elevated. It is most likely due to strain in the setting of hypovolemia. He has a history of CABG in 2146 with multiple PCI. He is on ASA and statin, but his beta-blocker is held due to sepsis.

His PUMP function has an EF of 29%. He is off of pressors. RHYTHM is CHB s/p DDD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several ongoing health concerns. The patient has an altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit and an increased heart rate of 82 beats per minute. Blood pressure is low at 86/46 mmHg, and respiratory rate is within normal range at 37 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 98% with the assistance of a ventilator.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,860 mL, with outputs of 2,642 mL (including 142 mL of urine output). The patient is receiving various medications including propofol, meropenem, tobramycin, and heparin sodium.

Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an ongoing infection. Blood cultures were taken on 3/25 and 3/26. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in kidney function, liver enzymes, glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's condition is described as severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications such as septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or death if not properly managed.

   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume resuscitated and came off
   pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of azytromycin.  C diff negative, no
   diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9 days but now grew out gram negative
   rods concerning for VAP, in the setting of leukocytosis and continued
   spiking. Grew out citrobacter freundii. Repeat cultures 2+ GNR.

   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - will measure dead space today
   Mental Status: improving, could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   - will consider for head CT tomorrow
   - currently light sedation with propofol
   Coagulopathy: improving, due to shock liver, platlets stable, no
   evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and multiorgan failure. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. 

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and deterioration. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including azithromycin, Piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, meropenem, and tobramycin. The patient's blood cultures showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs, indicating a possible bacterial infection.

The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was caused by Citrobacter freundii, a type of gram-negative bacteria. The patient's treatment regimen was adjusted accordingly, with the discontinuation of tobramycin and meropenem, and the initiation of vancomycin.

The patient's respiratory status has been concerning, with hypoxic respiratory failure and the development of pulmonary infiltrates. There is a possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the infiltrates seen on chest X-ray.

The patient's mental status has improved, but there are concerns about potential liver dysfunction, which may be related to the patient's history of shock and decreased metabolism of sedatives. The patient's coagulopathy is improving, and his plate"

   multiorgan failure.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Pneumonia as probable source with concurrent
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was addressed with River
   Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate was not obtained in ED.
   APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted mortality of 77%.  Legionella
   urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram negative rods and gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume resuscitated and came off
   pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of azytromycin.  C diff negative, no
   diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9 days but now grew out gram negative
   rods concerning for VAP, in the setting of leukocytosis and continued
   spiking.
   -          Patient on vanc [**10-26**], started on tobramycin and meropenem,
   d/c zosyn.
   -          Called lab, pending speciation and sensitivities
   .
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.
   Patient with elevated WBC counts and infiltrates on CXR. Consider ARDS
   given CXR.  Last ABG 7.43/33/63/23/0.  Now on PSV.
   - changed to PSV
   - will try to decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - will measure dead space today
   Mental Status: improving, could possibly be [**3-16**] shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose for liver
   - will consider for head CT tomorrow
   - currently light sedation with propofol
   Coagulopathy: improving, due to shock liver, platlets stable, no
   evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole.
   -trend LFTs, improving
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip, improving
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Current ARF
   likely due to acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.
   Patient with high normal CVP and MAPs > 65. Given elevated CK,
   possibility of myoglobinuria, but not consistent with UA findings.
   Urine output started, 200 cc/ 24 hr, patient off CVVH through L femoral
   line. Now getting dialysis thru that line. Renal recs to place tunneled
   IJ electively through IR once 24 hours afebrile.
   - now doing 20-30cc/hr urine output
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD goal negative 3L today
   Resp Alkalosis
 primary uncompensated, patient overbreathing vent
   - will monitor ABG
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr, at goal
   FEN
 will give tube feeds through OG tube
   PPx
 Hep SQ, PPI PO
   Family
 , family understands prognosis, patient has documented
   advanced directives
   - will watch for mental status improvement over the next few days given
   decreased sedation metabolism secondary to hepatic dysfx
   - if not significantly improved resp status, will terminally extubate

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

- The patient has a history of chronic renal failure (CRF) and is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
- The patient's mental status is altered, indicating a potential neurological issue. 
- There is evidence of sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by the presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). 
- The patient has malnutrition and hyperglycemia, which may be contributing factors to the overall severity of the condition. 
- The patient's blood cultures were taken on 03/25/2167 at 07:46 PM and 03/26/2167 at 02:08 AM, suggesting a concern for possible infection. 
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including meropenem, tobramycin, heparin sodium, propofol, and others. 
- The patient's vital signs show hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (elevated heart rate), and fever. 
- The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 
- The patient's laboratory results indicate renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes. 
- The patient's abdominal examination reveals significant scrotal edema and hypoactive bowel sounds. 
- The patient's neurologic examination shows minimal sedation with propofol and occasional ability to follow commands. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for more aggressive ventilatory support.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition can further compromise wound healing, immune function, and overall recovery.
5. Hyperglycemia: Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can increase the risk of infections, delayed wound healing, and other complications.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional clinical findings and investigations may be necessary to determine the exact nature and severity of the patient's conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. Recent events include hypotension and the removal of a large brown mucous plug, which could be consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased urine output. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's nutritional intake is being provided through a feeding tube, and glycemic control is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The presence of a large brown mucous plug and the increase in PEEP and FiO2 suggest a potential risk for VAP. This is further supported by the patient's recent hypotensive event.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates a systemic inflammatory response. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to identify any worsening of sepsis.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate impaired kidney function. Renal replacement therapy may be required to manage the patient's renal failure.
4. ARDS"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. 

The patient's recent events include becoming hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and a low central venous pressure (CVP) after the discontinuation of tobramycin. The patient was given 2 liters of normal saline and restarted on levo, which refers to the medication levofloxacin. Additionally, the patient experienced desaturation in the low 90s and was suctioned, resulting in the removal of a large brown mucous plug. This finding raises suspicion for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose, and liver enzymes. The electrolyte levels are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. His APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. He was treated with early goal-directed therapy and completed a course of azithromycin. He was also on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for 9 days but grew out gram-negative rods, which is concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he has pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, leading to the suspicion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's mental status has been improving, possibly due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives. His coagulopathy is improving, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). His transaminitis is likely due to shock liver in the setting of distributive shock with decreased cardiac output. He has a known common bile duct dilation, secondary to cholecystectomy.

The patient's cardiovascular status does not appear to be acute coronary syndrome (ACS), although his creatine kinase (CK) level is markedly elevated. This is most likely due to muscle strain in the setting of hypovolemia. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction (EF 30%). The patient presented with septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and multiorgan failure. He was admitted with an APACHE IV score of 114 and a predicted mortality of 77%. Legionella urinary antigen was negative, sputum culture showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs, and the patient completed a course of azithromycin. C. difficile was negative, and there was no diarrhea.

The patient was on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for 9 days but developed resistance to it, as evidenced by the growth of gram-negative rods, specifically Citrobacter freundii. The patient was then started on vancomycin and tobramycin but later restarted on tobramycin due to worsening condition.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, requiring norepinephrine infusion, and has shown signs of worsening respiratory failure with pulmonary infiltrates. He is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the causative organism is Citrobacter freundii. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, initially not immediately returning to baseline after sedation removal due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives.

The patient has a coagulopathy that is improving, likely caused by shock liver. His platelets are"

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including azithromycin, Zosyn, meropenem, and tobramycin. However, he developed leukocytosis and continued spiking fevers, leading to the suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures grew Citrobacter freundii, prompting the addition of vancomycin and reinitiation of tobramycin therapy.

His mental status is improving after initial presentation, and he is awake and following commands. There is evidence of a coagulopathy, most likely caused by shock liver, but platelets are stable and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, and the patient's cardiovascular status does not appear to be acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), malnutrition, hyperglycemia, and altered mental status. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for ongoing management. The patient's family has decided to proceed with tracheostomy placement. The patient experienced episodes of tachypnea, tachycardia, and mild hypotension during hemodialysis but responded well to a 500 cc bolus and sedation with Zyprexa. The patient's white blood cell count is rising after stopping tobramycin, so it has been restarted. The patient's Hct level has dropped from 27 to 24. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 103/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's ARDS, there is a risk of further respiratory distress and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Infection: The patient's rising WBC count suggests an ongoing infection, which may require adjustment in antibiotic therapy or additional interventions.
3. Renal function: The patient's chronic renal failure puts him at risk for further deterioration of renal function,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of rising WBCs after stopping tobramycin, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This indicates severe lung injury and impaired gas exchange.

3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may be exacerbated by acute kidney injury in the ICU setting. This can result in further deterioration of kidney function.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating poor glycemic control. This can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition is being managed with enteral feeding, suggesting malnutrition as a comorbid condition.

6. Sepsis: The patient's presentation includes signs of systemic inflammation, such as fever and tachycardia, which are consistent with sepsis.

7. Tracheostomy: The family meeting has decided to proceed with tracheostomy placement. This surgical intervention may be necessary for long-term airway management.

8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has demonstrated hypotension during hemodialysis, indicating potential cardiovascular compromise.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and a low ejection fraction (EF 30%). He was admitted with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and respiratory support, but continues to have worsening respiratory failure due to suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other complications include acute kidney injury, hypoalbuminemia, and a coagulopathy likely due to shock liver. The patient's mental status has improved after removal of sedation. The family has agreed to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary infiltrates and suspected VAP. Despite treatment with antibiotics, the patient's condition has worsened, indicating a potential complication.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute on chronic acute renal failure/uremia, with an elevated baseline creatinine level of 2.3. He has been receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis through the left femoral line. The plan is to place a tunneled internal jugular line for elective hemodialysis once the patient is afebrile.
3. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia is decreased in the setting of sepsis. Nutritional support through tube feeds is being provided.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. He completed a course of azithromycin and was initially volume-resuscitated and came off pressors on [3-21]. However, he developed worsening leukocytosis and continued spiking fevers, leading to the suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures grew Citrobacter freundii, and he was started on vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [3-26] but restarted on [3-27]. Zosyn and meropenem were stopped on [3-26].

The patient's mental status initially did not immediately return once sedation was removed due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives. He is now awake and following commands. The patient has a coagulopathy that is improving, likely caused by shock liver. His platelets are stable, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Transaminitis is also improving and is likely due to shock liver.

The patient's cardiovascular status shows signs of heart failure with an ejection fraction of 29%. He had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in [2146] with multiple percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He is currently on aspirin (ASA), a statin, and his beta-blocker has been held due to sepsis.

The patient's rhythm is currently chaotic atrial fibrillation (CHB) secondary to dual-chamber pacemaker (DDD PCM) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placed in [2160]. He is not on warfarin and will maintain on telemetry.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) on top of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine of 2.3. He is currently undergoing continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) through the left femoral line and will continue dialysis through that line. Renal recommendations include placing a tunneled inferior vena cava (IVC) line electively through interventional radiology (IR) once he is 24 hours afebrile.

The patient also has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely due to sepsis. His respiratory status shows signs of hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infiltrates, likely secondary to ARDS. There are plans for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Tuesday.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical with multiple organ dysfunctions. The family understands the prognosis, and the patient has documented advanced directives."

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male in the ICU with a history of chronic renal failure, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6 F, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on minimal sedation with propofol and occasionally follows commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction: The patient has multiple allo-antibodies in their blood, which could lead to a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction if incompatible blood is transfused.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating an ongoing infection that requires prompt management to prevent further complications.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to the ongoing sepsis and other comorbidities.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition could contribute to delayed wound healing, impaired immune function, and increased risk of infections.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, fever, and multiple allo-antibodies in their blood, which could potentially lead to a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through enteral feeding, and their glycemic control is being monitored. They are on multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment of various conditions, including DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.4°F (37.4°C), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, along with low hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. The patient's blood cultures were taken twice on the current day due to suspicion of infection. The patient's overall condition remains critical, and they require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction: The presence of multiple allo-antibodies in the patient's blood increases the risk of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction if incompatible blood is transfused.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and signs of infection indicate ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's condition.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory support and ABG results suggest ongoing respiratory distress, which may require further intervention and management.
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, which can contribute to fluid imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, and the need for ongoing dialysis.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's low albumin levels suggest malnutrition, which can impair wound healing, immune function, and overall recovery.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, indicating an increased risk of blood clots due to immobility and other risk factors.
8. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcers, which can occur due to critical illness and may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to endotracheal intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP.
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures 2+ GNR. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by infected
   HD line in femoral vein.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, presenting with septic shock, pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been admitted multiple times since March 21st and has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infection. He has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG in 2146. He also has a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation was septic shock due to pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrent or persistent sepsis if the current infection is not adequately controlled.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient developed VAP, which required a change in antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of further development or progression of VAP if appropriate measures are not taken.
3. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): The patient had a catheter-related bloodstream infection, as indicated by leukocytosis and positive cultures from the hemodialysis line. There is a risk of ongoing infection if the infected line is not removed and replaced with a new, properly sited line.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has anuric acute on chronic ARF/Uremia, likely due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypotension."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe malnutrition. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, and hepatic dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further progression of sepsis due to the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and positive urine culture. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures are crucial.

2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening lung function or development of new respiratory complications. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation support may be required.

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's pre-existing renal failure needs to be managed appropriately. Close monitoring of renal function tests and adjustment of dialysis regimen as needed are essential.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been noted to have elevated blood glucose levels. Tight glycemic control is important to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, which increases the risk of delayed wound healing, infections, and other complications. Nutritional support should be initiated and tailored to meet the patient's specific needs.

   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP and possible femoral line
   infection.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP.
   - patient to complete 14 day course of vancomycin on [**3-31**].
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein. Will complete 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem.
    - cont tobra/meropenem, will continue until [**4-3**].
   - cont PSV 12/5 trials, currently on PSV 17/5
   - IP will trach/PEG on Tuesday ( will notify of severe anemia and
   complication in transfusion)
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia.
   -          will notify IR for line placement and IP for [**Female First Name (un) **] placement
   -          will give iron now
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive

   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.

   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection.
           - Last HD [**3-28**]
   - place IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port, non-tunnelled since still

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure from pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. He completed a course of azithromycin and was on Zosyn for 9 days until he developed VAP. The patient has been on vancomycin and tobramycin, which was discontinued but restarted due to worsening hypotension and sepsis. Repeat cultures showed Citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobramycin/meropenem. The patient will continue with tobramycin/meropenem until April 3rd. The patient also has severe anemia and should only receive blood transfusions in emergency settings of active ischemia. Mental status is improving, coagulopathy is resolving, and transaminitis is improving due to shock liver. The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, and he is off pressors. The patient has acute kidney injury with anuria, and dialysis has been initiated through the left femoral line."

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, presenting with septic shock, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's respiratory support consists of endotracheal intubation with CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's blood culture results indicate the presence of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 16.8 to 30.2 thousand/mm3, elevated hematocrit (Hct) levels, and decreased platelet count. Liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine (Cr) levels.

The patient's clinical course is complicated by various complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and hypoalbuminemia. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient's condition has been unstable, with periods of improvement followed by deterioration. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including azithromycin, zosyn, meropenem, and vancomycin. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG and PCI, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which was treated with early goal-directed therapy. The source of sepsis was pneumonia, and the patient responded well to volume resuscitation and antibiotic therapy.
2. VAP PNA/Resp Failure/ARDS: The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leading to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This was likely due to pulmonary infiltrates caused by retained partial dentures. The patient's condition initially improved but then worsened, necessitating a change in antibiotic therapy.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, with a positive direct Coombs test and the presence"

   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein. Will complete 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a possible femoral line infection. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. He also received River's Early Goal Directed Therapy for septic shock.

The patient's condition has been improving and then worsening, with signs of respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and VAP. He has an elevated white blood cell count and infiltrates on chest X-ray. ARDS is secondary to the pneumonia. Initially, the patient was improving but then started to deteriorate due to possible VAP. The VAP grew out Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to tobramycin and meropenem.

The patient also has severe anemia with a positive direct Coombs test (DAT), indicating that he has antibodies that will cause hemolysis of donor blood. Only transfusion should be done in emergency settings of active ischemia. The patient has anemia of chronic disease and will not benefit from iron supplementation.

Other findings include improving coagulopathy, transaminitis likely due to shock liver, and hypoalbuminemia decreased in the setting of sepsis. The patient's mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, an ejection fraction of 30%, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. He has undergone various interventions, including antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and placement of a femoral line for hemodialysis. The patient's condition has been complicated by anemia of chronic disease, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, transaminitis, and hypoalbuminemia. He has also had issues with mental status changes and cardiac function. The patient's family has agreed to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for long-term management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia of chronic disease: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic inflammation and may not respond well to iron supplementation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating chronic kidney disease. Acute tubular necrosis may have occurred due to hypotension, leading to anuric acute on chronic ARF/uremia.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is improving but may be related to shock liver and decreased metabolism of coagulation factors.
4. Transaminitis:"

   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP and possible femoral line
   infection.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   - will bolus for CVP <14 with NS 250cc
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein. Will complete 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem.
    - cont tobra/meropenem, will continue until [**4-3**].
   - cont SBT, spoke to respiratory
   - IP will trach/PEG on Tuesday ( will notify of severe anemia and
   complication in transfusion). From speaking to IP/thoraccis, patient is
   addon for OR today, rpt Hct 19.4, and pt getting 1u PRBC now, will
   notify family if procedure happens today
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   -          will notify IR for line placement and IP for [**Female First Name (un) **] placement
   (depends on Hct status)
   -          heme consult placed [**3-31**] for anemia and DAT positive, sent

   non-tunnelled HD line [**3-31**]. Tip culture grew yeast. Non-cadidida
   albicans.
   - consulting ID re starting antifungals.
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   - decreased dose of PRN ativan
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   - 2u FFP on call to OR for trach and PEG today
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   - will con

   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection.
           - Last HD [**3-28**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure from pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection.

The patient's medical history includes a previous central line infection, which was treated with antibiotics. He also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is currently undergoing hemodialysis through a femoral line. The patient has severe anemia and is DAT positive, indicating that he should only receive blood transfusions in emergency settings of active ischemia. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. His coagulation profile is improving, but he still has transaminitis and hypoalbuminemia. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible myocardial damage. His renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level.

The patient's current plan of care includes continuing with tobramycin and meropenem for VAP, which grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to these antibiotics. He will also continue with daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and will undergo a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of VAP, development of new infections due to prolonged use of central lines, further decline in renal function, and potential complications"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, diabetes, and sepsis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 110/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving fluids and blood products as needed. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 18.6 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 367 K/uL. His blood glucose level is within normal range at 102 mg/dL. Renal function tests reveal a creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL and urea nitrogen level of 39 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. Liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes but are not significantly abnormal. 

The patient has a history of multiple infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infection, for which he is receiving appropriate antibiotics. His nutritional status is impaired, and he requires enteral nutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further deterioration of renal function, development of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications related to prolonged immobilization and malnutrition. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP and possible femoral line
   infection.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein. Will complete 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem.
    - cont tobra/meropenem, will continue until [**4-3**].
   - cont SBT, spoke to respiratory
   - IP will trach/PEG on Tuesday ( will notify of severe anemia and
   complication in transfusion). From speaking to IP/thoraccis, patient is
   addon for OR today, rpt Hct 19.4, and pt getting 1u PRBC now, will
   notify family if procedure happens today
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron.
   -          will notify IR for line placement and IP for [**Female First Name (un) **] placement
   (depends on Hct status)
   -          heme consult placed [**3-31**] for anemia and DAT positive, sent
   smear and retic count, will follow LDH and hapto, bili not as helpful
   giving resolving shock liver
   -          starting IV folate
   -          spoke to renal [**3-31**] to increase EPO, but will not help
   significantly
   ? of line infection
 removed fem line, culture pending, IR to place
   non-tunnelled HD line today
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   - will con
t to monitor
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection.
           - Last HD [**3-28**]
   - place IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port, non-tunnelled since still
   spiking ( will notify of severe anemia and complication in
   transfusion), will f/u with IR
   - renal giving additional EPO, see above
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. Legionella urinary antigen negative, sputum culture showing gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient has been on vancomycin and tobramycin, which were discontinued on 3/26 but restarted on 3/27 due to worsening hypotension and sepsis. Repeat cultures grew Citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobramycin/meropenem. The patient has anemia, severe anemia with a DAT (super Coombs positive), many antibodies, and will hemolyze donor blood. Only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia. The patient also has hypoalbuminemia and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which was resolved with fluid resuscitation and the implementation of River's Early Goal Directed Therapy. However, there is a risk of recurrence if the source of infection is not adequately controlled.
2. Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient developed VAP, which led to worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This condition can progress to respiratory failure and"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP and possible femoral line
   infection.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   - will bolus for CVP <14 with NS 250cc
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein. Will complete 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem.
    - cont tobra/meropenem, will continue until [**4-3**].
   - cont SBT, spoke to respiratory
   - IP will trach/PEG on Tuesday ( will notify of severe anemia and
   complication in transfusion). From speaking to IP/thoraccis, patient is
   addon for OR today, rpt Hct 19.4, and pt getting 1u PRBC now, will
   notify family if procedure happens today
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   -          will notify IR for line placement and IP for [**Female First Name (un) **] placement
   (depends on Hct status)
   -          heme consult placed [**3-31**] for anemia and DAT positive, sent
   smear and retic count, will follow LDH and hapto, bili not as helpful
   giving resolving shock liver
   ? of line infection
 removed fem line [**3-28**], culture pending, IR placed
   non-tunnelled HD line [**3-31**]. Tip culture grew yeast. Non-cadidida
   albicans.
   - consulting ID re starting antifungals.
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   - decreased dose of PRN ativan
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   - 2u FFP on call to OR for trach and PEG today
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   - will con
t to monitor
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection.
           - Last HD [**3-28**]
   - place IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port, non-tunnelled since still
   spiking ( will notify of severe anemia and complication in
   transfusion), will f/u with IR

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, ejection fraction of 30%, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient's APACHE IV score was 114 with a predicted mortality of 77%. Legionella urinary antigen was negative, sputum culture showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient was initially treated with azithromycin, followed by a 14-day course of vancomycin. Due to worsening hypotension and sepsis, tobramycin was restarted for likely VAP. Repeat cultures grew Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to tobramycin/meropenem. The patient will continue on tobramycin/meropenem until April 3rd.

The patient also has severe anemia, with a DAT (super Coombs positive) indicating that the patient's blood cells will be destroyed by transfused blood. Only emergency transfusions should be given in settings of active ischemia. The patient has anemia of chronic disease and will not benefit from iron supplementation. Folate levels are normal, B12 is high, and there is evidence of hemolysis due to low haptoglobin and high LDH.

A hematology consult was placed on March 31st for anemia and DAT positive, with a smear and retic count sent"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient's condition initially improved but has now worsened due to suspected VAP. He has been on various antibiotics including vancomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**4-1**] but failed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He is scheduled for an open G-tube placement on [**4-2**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's initial improvement followed by worsening suggests a possible VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been restarted, and the patient is being monitored closely.
2. Femoral line infection: The removal of the femoral line on [**3-28**] and the subsequent culture showing yeast growth indicate a possible line infection. The patient has already been switched to a non-tunnelled HD line, and fungal blood cultures are pending.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia with a positive direct Coombs test, suggesting autoimmune hemolysis. Blood transfusions should be reserved for emergencies only.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure, resolved septic shock, treated ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and persistent acute renal failure/chronic kidney disease (ARF/ESRD). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to wean him off as tolerated. He has completed treatment for Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Gram-negative rod (GNR) pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated complications: Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma.

2. Nosocomial infections: The patient has been treated for Staphylococcus pneumoniae and GNR pneumonia, indicating a possible nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection. Other hospital-acquired infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections, may also occur due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has ARF/ESRD, which indicates impaired kidney function. AKI can worsen renal function and lead to further complications like fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.

4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can increase the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and other comorbidities. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing respiratory support and hemodynamic instability. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tube placement, blood product transfusions, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's laboratory results indicate ongoing inflammation, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to decreased oxygenation and increased work of breathing.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations indicate ongoing cardiovascular compromise, which can lead to shock and organ hypoperfusion.
3. Infection: Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient remains at risk for nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's chronic renal failure may progress, leading to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and uremic symptoms.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and prolonged bedrest.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagulability increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
7. Malnutrition and glycemic control: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient's condition initially improved but then worsened, leading to the restart of meropenem and tobramycin due to suspected VAP. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there are infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating ARDS secondary to pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, failure of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), open G-tube placement, removal of femoral line, and placement of a non-tunnelled hemodialysis line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours. This increases the risk of mortality and prolongs hospital stays.
2. Femoral line infection: The patient may have a line infection at the femoral site, indicated by leukocytosis and positive cultures. This can lead to sepsis and requires prompt treatment.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis. This may require hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has resolved septic shock and treated ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient still has persistent respiratory failure and acute renal failure/end-stage renal disease (ARF/ESRD). 

24-hour events include a transfusion and successful endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 to 134/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient is receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, lorazepam, and heparin sodium. Other medications have been reviewed on rounds and no antibiotics are currently being administered. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Flow sheet data shows the patient's fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 449 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH of 7"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   ====
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.
   - cont SBT, spoke to respiratory and to continue to come down on PSV
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   -          Heme following
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
           - HD today
   -  renal giving EPO
   - patient afebrile since [**4-1**], will consider changing to tunneled line
   if remains afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          decreased dose of PRN ativan
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,
   increased free water boluses on [**4-4**] given slowly increasing serum
   sodium.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube placement, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) failure. The patient's medical history includes anemia, septic shock/hypotension, coagulopathy, transaminitis, oliguric acute on chronic acute renal failure (ARF)/uremia, mental status changes, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's current condition includes hypoalbuminemia and a recent increase in serum sodium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It is caused by bacteria that colonize the endotracheal tube and can lead to pneumonia.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric ARF, indicating reduced urine output. AKI can occur due to various reasons such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis, which may be due to shock liver caused by septic shock. Liver function"

   ====
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.
   - cont SBT, spoke to respiratory and to continue to come down on PSV
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   -          Heme following
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   ? of line infection
 removed fem line [**3-28**], culture pending, IR placed
   non-tunnelled HD line [**3-31**]. Tip culture grew yeast. Non-cadidida
   albicans. ID recommended no antifungals. Since yeast in urine as well,
   changed foley [**4-1**].
   - f/u fungal blood cultures.
   Ear pain
 complaining from [**4-2**], no tragus tenderness or evidence of
   otitis externa. No evidence of infection on otoscopic exam.
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   - 2u FFP on call to OR for open Gtube today
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
           - HD today
   -  renal giving EPO
   - patient afebrile since [**4-1**], will consider changing to tunneled line
   if remains afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          decreased dose of PRN ativan
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with significant heart disease, including an ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and possible femoral line infection. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and tobramycin. He underwent tracheostomy placement on [**4-1**] and failed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient then went to the operating room on [**4-3**] for open gastrostomy tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient initially improved but then worsened, suggesting a possible case of VAP. Cultures grew Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to tobramycin and meropenem. Repeat cultures showed the same organism.
2. Femoral line infection: There is a suspicion of infected hemodialysis (HD) line in the femoral vein, as indicated by leukocytosis. The tip culture is pending.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia with a Coombs positive DAT, many antibodies, and evidence of hemolysis. Only transfusion should be done in emergency settings of active ischemia.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient experienced resolved hypotension, likely"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of pneumonia, sepsis, renal failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes in place. They have impaired muscle performance, chronic renal failure, and are receiving hemodialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have diminished breath sounds in the chest and significant edema in both extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes, among other abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's history of pneumonia and sepsis puts them at risk for developing ARDS, which is already present. Monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is crucial, and weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper oral hygiene, head-of-bed elevation, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential for preventing and managing this condition.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's chronic renal failure requires ongoing hemodialysis. Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is vital to prevent further deterioration.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis, which led to tracheostomy and g-tube placement. The patient also has chronic renal failure and has been unable to receive hemodialysis (HD) yesterday. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL and respiratory rate (RR) set at 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%. The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings ranging from 85/42 mmHg to 104/64 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is stable, ranging from 71 to 110 beats per minute. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, ranging from 36.2 to 37.3 degrees Celsius.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures of tracheal aspirates are necessary to detect early signs of infection.
2. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may worsen due to inadequate fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte management are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been on hemodialysis (HD) and has experienced various medical complications including anemia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, oliguric acute on chronic acute renal failure (ARF)/uremia, mental status changes, and hypoalbuminemia. The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), open gastrostomy, and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours. It is caused by bacteria that colonize the respiratory tract and infect the lungs.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI)/acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to AKI/ARF. This could be due to factors such as sepsis, hypotension, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, which may be attributed to chronic disease"

The patient's oliguric acute on chronic acute renal failure (ARF) is attributed to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension. He underwent continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) through the left femoral line, followed by intermittent hemodialysis (HD). The patient's mental status initially did not immediately return once sedation was removed due to shock liver and decreased metabolism of sedatives.

Cardiovascularly, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG and multiple PCI. He is currently on ASA and statin, but his beta-blocker was held due to sepsis. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure ranging from 91/44 mmHg to 124/79 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient is unable to provide a history as they are on a ventilator.

The patient has undergone various interventions and tests, including blood cultures, urine culture, infusion of medications such as heparin sodium, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole. The patient also has a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support.

The patient's lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, and glucose levels. The patient has impaired muscle performance, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's anemia is being followed, and the patient is receiving nutritional support through a g-tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on a ventilator for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's new fever and ongoing micro work-up may indicate an infection, and it is important to monitor for symptoms and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure and impaired muscle performance. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), blood pressure ranging from 91/44 mmHg to 124/79 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The platelet count is within normal range, but creatinine levels are elevated. Other lab values, including electrolytes and enzymes, are also abnormal.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no assessment of skin or neurologic status due to being on ventilator.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include worsening respiratory failure, infection (as indicated by the fever and ongoing work-up for micro), and potential complications related to chronic renal failure. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in vital signs, further deterioration of respiratory status, and the results of the ongoing work-up for infection. Additionally, the patient's muscle weakness and anemia should be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) due to acute kidney injury (AKI) and has undergone tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placements. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to VAP, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with multiple types of infections, including CAP, VAP, and potentially a line infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent the spread of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia due to hemolysis caused by antibodies in his blood. Blood transfusion should only be done in emergency settings of active ischemia.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, likely secondary to shock liver. Platelet counts are stable, but there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric AKI from acute tubular necrosis. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and intermittent hemodialysis (HD"

 sent blood, urine cultures
   (awaiting sputum), will change foley today, will leave RIJ given IR
   placement and need for dialysis
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.

   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   -          Heme following
   -          In communication with blood bank with regards to units
   avaliable
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
           - f/u renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - cannot change to tunneled line, spiked [**4-5**] -> will tunnel when
   cultures neg/stops spiking
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          decreased dose of PRN ativan
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on hemodialysis.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension, likely due to pneumonia as a probable source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.

2. Pneumonia (VAP): Patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, which initially improved and then worsened. The patient has been on various antibiotics including meropenem, tobramycin, and vancomycin. The repeat cultures showed citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem.

3. Anemia: Severe anemia, likely due to autoimmune hemolysis as indicated by a positive direct Coombs test. The patient should only be transfused in emergency settings of active ischemia. The anemia is also attributed to chronic disease, and the patient will not benefit from iron supplementation.

4. Coagulopathy: Improving, likely due to shock liver. Platelets are stable, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

5. Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in the setting of distributive picture with decreased EF."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic renal failure, sepsis, and other comorbidities. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, altered mental status, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, muscle performance, transfers, ventilation, and malnutrition. He also has a history of heart failure (CHF), chronic impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to acute lung injury and difficulty in oxygenation. There is a risk of developing further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Renal Complications: The patient has chronic renal failure (CRF), increasing the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), which may result in worsening cardiac function and potential cardiac complications.
4. Infection-related Complications: The patient is at high risk for infections due to impaired immune system function, especially in the ICU setting. Sepsis is already present, and there is a risk of developing other infections like catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcers.
5. Nutritional Complications: The patient's impaired nutritional status may lead to malnutrition and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with ischemic heart disease and a low ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) and has experienced various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period of time. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and changes in sputum culture.
2. Line-related infection: The patient has had multiple lines placed, including a tunneled dialysis catheter, central venous catheters, and arterial lines. These lines can serve as potential sources of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and local signs of inflammation at the insertion site, is crucial.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric acute kidney injury, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis due to hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary. Continued use of renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, may be required.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis, likely due to shock liver. Monitoring liver enzymes and assessing for"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   leukocytosis
 one spike on [**4-5**]
 blood culture negative, urine showed
   yeast, sputum showing pansensitive serratia in setting of improved
   pulmonary status.
   - will change to tunneled HD line [**4-8**]
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.
   -          cont to wean to trach mask
   -          S&S for PMV
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   -          Heme following
   -          In communication with blood bank with regards to units
   available
   -          Rechecking ferritin and retic count
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
           - f/u renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - changing to tunneled HD line [**4-8**]
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          decreased dose of PRN ativan
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Started on ACE for afterload reduction in setting of mitral
   regurgitation
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,
   increased free water boluses on [**4-4**] given slowly increasing serum

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 119/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is being ventilated mechanically.

The patient has a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube in place. There is significant scrotal edema observed during the physical examination. The patient's extremities show 2+ edema but remain well perfused. Neurologically, the patient is off sedation and able to follow commands.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate, suggesting possible renal dysfunction and tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver enzymes, are relatively stable.

The patient's current conditions include heart failure, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity, balance, muscle performance, ventilation, altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient may include worsening heart failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent these complications and optimize the patient's overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis
 progressive since [**4-5**]
 blood culture NTD, urine showed
   yeast, sputum showing pansensitive serratia in setting of improved
   pulmonary status. Holding antibiotics at this time. Differential
   includes line infection, VAP, sinusitis, cholecystisits, pancreatitis.
   - panculturing now, getting cultures of the non-tunnelled HD line in
   since [**3-31**].
   - getting CXR today
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - getting UENI of L arm to eval for thombosis, differential includes
   thrombophebilits
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.
   -          cont to wean to trach mask
   -          Continue pulmonary toilet and chest PT.
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   -          Heme following, resending hemolysis labs and smear [**4-8**]
   -          In communication with blood bank with regards to units
   available
   -          Rechecking ferritin and retic count
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**]. Hypotensive after HD with multiple liters of fluid removed,
   mentating fine with SBP in 80s.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
           - f/u renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          Stopping ativan, will give zyprexa if needed
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Started on ACE for afterload reduction in setting of mitral
   regurgitation
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a low ejection fraction (EF 30%). He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) due to acute renal failure.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. VAP: The patient has developed VAP, which is a secondary infection acquired during mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture showed pansensitive Serratia, and the patient was treated with meropenem and tobramycin. However, the VAP recurred, and the patient required a repeat course of antibiotics.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has progressive leukocytosis since April 5th. Blood cultures are pending, and the differential diagnosis includes line infection, VAP, sinusitis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis.

3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, which is likely due to autoimmune hemolysis as indicated by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and many antibodies. The patient should only be transfused in emergency settings of active ischemia. The cause of hemolysis is believed to be anemia of chronic disease, and iron supplementation will not be beneficial.

4. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient experienced septic shock"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%. He was admitted with septic shock and multi-organ failure from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) and is currently showing signs of improvement in his pulmonary status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. This requires prompt antibiotic therapy and other interventions to prevent further complications.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia. The patient has been started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) through the left femoral line and later switched to hemodialysis (HD). Close monitoring of renal function and adjustments to fluid and electrolyte balance are necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, likely due to chronic disease and hemolysis. Blood transfusions should be given only in emergency settings of active ischemia. Iron supplementation is not recommended as the patient has anemia of chronic disease.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient initially presented with coagulopathy, which appears to be caused by shock liver. Platelet counts are stable,"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia in setting of improved pulmonary status. No other organisms
   have grown in  blood or sputum.  Did have positive c.diff reported this
   morning.
   - pan culture again
   - CXR to evaluate for PNA, no obvious consolidation
   - KUB to follow c.diff, belly exam benign
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - consider line infection as well as etiology
   - treat HAP with vanco/zosyn, peel off in 48 hrs if no growth evident,
   likely is colonized with serratia
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multiorgan failure from CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and current on hemodialysis (HD). The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. He has a positive c.diff infection, and his blood culture showed yeast. The sputum culture revealed pansensitive serratia, and the patient's lungs are showing signs of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient also has severe anemia due to autoimmune hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates sepsis, as evidenced by fever, hypotension, and altered mental status.
3. Multiorgan failure: The patient is experiencing multiorgan failure, including renal, hepatic, and respiratory dysfunction.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status suggests ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia in setting of improved pulmonary status. No other organisms
   have grown in  blood or sputum.  Did have positive c.diff reported this
   morning.
   - pan culture again
   - CXR to evaluate for PNA, no obvious consolidation
   - KUB to follow c.diff, belly exam benign
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - consider line infection as well as etiology
   - treat HAP with vanco/zosyn, peel off in 48 hrs if no growth evident,
   likely is colonized with serratia
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme consult, likely having accelerated breakdown
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today for Hct of 19 in setting of new sepsis from
   c.diff
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          Stopping ativan, will give zyprexa if needed
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis
 progressive since [**4-5**]
 blood culture NTD, urine showed
   yeast, sputum showing pansensitive serratia in setting of improved
   pulmonary status. Holding antibiotics at this time. Differential
   includes line infection, VAP, sinusitis, cholecystisits, pancreatitis.
   - panculturing now, getting cultures of the non-tunnelled HD line in
   since [**3-31**].
   - getting CXR today
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - getting UENI of L arm to eval for thombosis, differential includes
   thrombophebilits
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.
   -          cont to wean to trach mask
   -          Continue pulmonary toilet and chest PT.
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   -          Heme following, resending hemolysis labs and smear [**4-8**]
   -          In communication with blood bank with regards to units
   available
   -          Rechecking ferritin and retic count
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-21**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP. Patient completed 14 day course of vancomycin on
   [**3-31**]. Hypotensive after HD with multiple liters of fluid removed,
   mentating fine with SBP in 80s.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
           - f/u renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          Stopping ativan, will give zyprexa if needed
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Started on ACE for afterload reduction in setting of mitral
   regurgitation
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a low ejection fraction (EF 30%). He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has had multiple lines and catheters placed. His condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including leukocytosis, anemia, thrombosis, dysphonia, ARDS, C. difficile infection, coagulopathy, transaminitis, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has had progressive leukocytosis since 4/5, with blood cultures showing yeast and sputum showing pan-sensitive Serratia marcescens. This suggests a possible line infection or VAP. The patient is currently holding antibiotics while awaiting cultures and panculturing.
2. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia with a positive direct Coombs test, indicating autoimmune hemolysis. He is DAT positive with many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Only transfusion in emergency settings of active ischemia is recommended.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has LUE swelling, which could be due to thrombosis from pacer wires. A left upper extremity"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia in setting of improved pulmonary status. No other organisms
   have grown in  blood or sputum.  Did have positive c.diff reported this
   morning.
   - pan culture again
   - CXR to evaluate for PNA, no obvious consolidation
   - KUB to follow c.diff, belly exam benign
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - consider line infection as well as etiology
   - treat HAP with vanco/zosyn, peel off in 48 hrs if no growth evident,
   likely is colonized with serratia
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme consult, likely having accelerated breakdown
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today for Hct of 19 in setting of new sepsis from
   c.diff
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for aggitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Stopping ACEI in setting of hypotension
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,
   increased free water boluses on [**4-4**] given slowly increasing serum
   sodium.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fever and leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) since April 5th, indicating a possible infection. The presence of yeast in the urine and positive cultures for serratia suggest ongoing infections. Additionally, the patient developed sepsis from Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient developed pneumonia (PNA) with pulmonary infiltrates, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Initially improving, the patient's condition worsened due to possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

3. Hypotension/septic shock: The patient was initially hypotensive and received early goal-directed therapy for septic shock. The Apache IV score indicated severe illness. The patient's blood pressure has been trending downward, possibly due to sepsis or the use of ativan.

4. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, which is likely due to accelerated hemolysis caused by antibodies in their blood. The patient should only receive blood transfusions in emergency settings of active ischemia.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient initially had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it is now improving. The patient's platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of right chest wall pain and fever. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and cholecystitis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 107/48-119/64 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft non-tender abdomen, significant scrotal edema, and stage 2 decubitus ulcer around the perianal area. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is off sedation and following commands.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperchlorcemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria.

The patient's condition has been complicated by Clostridium difficile"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, treating for HAP with
   vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR and
   stopped vanco. KUB did not show any evidence of megacolon. Also will
   consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP with, peel off in 48 hrs if no growth evident, likely is
   colonized with serratia
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme consult, likely having accelerated breakdown
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today for Hct of 19 in setting of new sepsis from
   c.diff
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for aggitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a low ejection fraction. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has shown improvement but continues to experience complications. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia), and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent spike in leukocytosis and fever suggests the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection could be related to C. difficile, HAP, or a line infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric acute on chronic ARF (acute renal failure) with a baseline creatinine of 2.3. He is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to hypotension and hypoperfusion.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's initial pneumonia has progressed to VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. Appropriate antibiotic therapy needs to be continued or adjusted based on culture results.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has tested positive for C"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with meropenem.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on meropenem.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme consult, likely having accelerated breakdown
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today for Hct of 19 in setting of new sepsis from
   c.diff
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for aggitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Stopping ACEI in setting of hypotension
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with meropenem.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on meropenem.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme consult, likely having accelerated breakdown
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today for Hct of 19 in setting of new sepsis from
   c.diff
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for aggitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,
   increased free water boluses on [**4-4**] given slowly increasing serum
   sodium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was initially on high-dose antibiotics but developed Clostridium difficile colitis, leading to the discontinuation of oral vancomycin and IV flagyl. The patient then developed health care-associated pneumonia (HAP) due to Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia species, which were initially colonized and subsequently infected. The patient's condition worsened, and he required mechanical ventilation.

The patient has had multiple complications including acute kidney injury (AKI), coagulopathy, anemia of chronic disease, and hypoalbuminemia. He has been treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent hemodialysis (HD). The patient's mental status improved after removing sedation but fluctuated due to liver dysfunction. His cardiac function has been monitored closely, and he is on appropriate cardiac medications.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), meropenem, and tobramycin. He has also received antifungal therapy with metronidazole. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with meropenem.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on meropenem.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - started levophed for pressure support
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - place arterial line today
   - wean pressors as possible
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above, follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme consult, likely having accelerated breakdown
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today for Hct of 19 in setting of new sepsis from
   c.diff
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for aggitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, HAP with meropenem, and treatment for c.diff. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including leukocytosis/fever, anemia, LUE swelling, dysphonia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, mental status changes, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.
2. Anemia: The patient's severe anemia is likely due to accelerated hemolysis. Hemolytic workup and consultation with a hematologist should be done.
3. LUE Swelling: The left upper extremity swelling could be related to thrombosis from pacemaker wires. Monitoring and appropriate intervention should be considered.
4. Dysphonia: The patient's dysphonia is attributed to a cuffed tracheostomy tube. Tracheostomy tube change and ENT consultation should be planned.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP. He is currently on HD with c diff colitis, on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl, and HAP GNR with meropenem. The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis/fever, progressive since 4-5, with blood culture NTD, urine showing yeast, and sputum showing pansensitive serratia and klebsiella oxytoca. He also has anemia, severe anemia with DAT (super Coombs positive), hemolyzing donor blood, and only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia. Other findings include dysphonia due to cuffed trach, improving coagulopathy, transaminitis likely due to shock liver, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, mental status awake and following commands, and hypoalbuminemia decreasing in the setting of sepsis. The patient has a history of CABG, PCI, CHF, EF 29%, on ASA, statin, re-start BB when pressures stable, CHB s/p DDD PCM, ICD in 2160, and not on Warfarin. He has a low EF, CHB, and hypoalbuminemia."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of chronic conditions such as chronic systolic heart failure, chronic anemia, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient also has acute issues like Clostridium difficile infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hyperglycemia.

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of these conditions. They are receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and renal nutrition support. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they do show signs of hypotension and altered mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, worsening renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of skin integrity. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), severe systolic heart failure, and acute renal failure. He initially improved but then developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and required tracheostomy. He was taken off the ventilator but subsequently worsened, leading to the need for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and the initiation of pressors. As of the most recent assessment, the patient is off pressors and shows signs of improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has a history of septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a widespread infection that affects the body's organs. It can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff infection, which is a bacterial infection caused by the Clostridium difficile bacteria. This infection can cause severe diarrhea and abdominal pain, and it can be challenging to treat.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient developed VAP after being on mechanical ventilation. VAP is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on a ventilator for an extended period. It can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which is"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuccitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - back on ventilator AC and more comfortable
   - wean to trach mask as tolerated
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunnelled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line when afebrile
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for aggitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr stopped for 24 s/p G tube placement,

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> will change flagyl to TID dosing per renal
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - add dopamine today, has room with HR and has poor EF at baseline
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line on Monday if remains afebrile
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

   off.
   CTX for klebsiella VAP.
   C. diff:  continue IV flagyl and po vanco
   Acute renal failure:  on CVVH, try and remove fluid.  Will hold off on
   tunneled catheter until off CVVH.
   high residuals on TFs:  will try erythromycin for improved motility.
   Respiratory failure:  On PSV ventilation, but will need more fluid off
   before he can wean more.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and requires intensive care. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions such as IV fluids, pressors, and changes in ventilation mode. He also has klebsiella VAP and is being treated with CTX antibiotics. The patient has several medical complications, including septic and cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, Clostridium difficile infection, and high residuals on tube feedings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic and cardiogenic shock: The patient's unstable hemodynamics indicate ongoing shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), indicating renal dysfunction. This may require further management, such as dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is being treated with IV flagyl and oral vancomycin for C. difficile infection. It is important to monitor for symptoms of worsening infection or complications.
4. Klebsiella VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with klebsiella VAP and is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy with CTX. Close monitoring for clinical improvement and potential complications related to VAP is necessary.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> flagyl changed to TID
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - add dopamine today, has room with HR and has poor EF at baseline
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   - F/u new Gram neg sensitivities
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   - Consider EPO to bolster
   - Add Fe++ po
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, stable
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   - Will hold off until resp status improves
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - No placement of tunneled HD line as pos blood cultures
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   .
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Consider midodrine if pressure supports, otherwise add
   vasopressin if hypotensive
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, ejection fraction of 30%, who was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on hemodialysis and has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis, which is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. The patient has also been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) caused by Gram-negative rods, specifically Serratia and Klebsiella oxytoca, for which he is being treated with meropenem.

The patient has shown improvement in his condition but continues to experience complications. He is still hypotensive and requires vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. His mental status has fluctuated, and he has been sedated due to shock liver. He has anemia of chronic disease, likely exacerbated by hemolysis due to blood transfusions. The patient also has elevated lactate levels, indicating ongoing end-organ hypoperfusion.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition. These include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest that he may still be experiencing sepsis, possibly due to C. difficile infection or another source.
2. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria and"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> will change flagyl to TID dosing per renal
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - add dopamine today, has room with HR and has poor EF at baseline
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guiaic negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - change to tunneled HD line on Monday if remains afebrile
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> will change flagyl to TID dosing per renal
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - add dopamine today, has room with HR and has poor EF at baseline
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, continue to monitor
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .

The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, ejection fraction 30%, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP (pneumonia) complicated by VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), currently on HD (hemodialysis) with c.diff colitis on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl, and HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) GNR with ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis/fever - progressive since 4-5, spiked last two nights. Blood culture NTB, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily infected on 4-7. Positive c.diff 4-8 in the setting of prolonged antibiotic administration.
2. Septic Shock/Hypotension - initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock. Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114. Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs. Initial PNA treated. Then patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until 4-1. He was doing well until last two days when BPs started to trend downward. Thought to possibly due to Ativan.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   .
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] was on
   ceftriaxone, currently on meropenem [**4-13**] due to CTX interaction with
   CVVH
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> flagyl changed to TID
   - lactates stable at 2.2
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - Tried dopamine, but weaned off
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion - stable
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able totolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem) ending [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   - F/u new Gram neg sensitivities
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   - Add Procrit
   - Add Fe++ po
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, stable
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   - Will hold off until resp status improves
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - No placement of tunneled HD line as pos blood cultures
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   .
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Consider midodrine if pressure supports, otherwise add
   vasopressin if hypotensive

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   .
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] was on
   ceftriaxone, currently on meropenem [**4-13**] due to CTX interaction with
   CVVH
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> flagyl changed to TID
   - lactates stable at 2.2
   - ID c/s for persistent fever
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - Tried dopamine, but weaned off
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion - stable
   - on CVVH
   - Started midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean
   Levophed
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able totolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem) ending [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   - F/u new Gram neg sensitivities
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   - F/u hemolysis labs
   - Add Procrit
   - Add Fe++ po
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, stable
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   - Will hold off until resp status improves
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - No placement of tunneled HD line as pos blood cultures
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   .
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Add midodrine
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a femoral line. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Gram-negative rods. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues including severe anemia, coagulopathy, oliguric acute on chronic renal failure/uremia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has had multiple infections including septic shock, C. difficile colitis, and HAP. There is a concern for further infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to VAP. This may require prolonged mechanical ventilation and may lead to further lung complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia with a positive direct Coombs test, indicating autoimmune hemolysis. Blood transfusions should be used cautiously due to the patient's antibodies against"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> flagyl changed to TID
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - add dopamine today, has room with HR and has poor EF at baseline
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   - F/u new Gram neg sensitivities
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   - Consider EPO to bolster
   - Add Fe++ po
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, stable
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   - Will hold off until resp status improves
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - No placement of tunneled HD line as pos blood cultures
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   .
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Consider midodrine if pressure supports, otherwise add
   vasopressin if hypotensive
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] currently
   on ceftriaxone.
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> flagyl changed to TID
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - add dopamine today, has room with HR and has poor EF at baseline
   - d/c ativan because worsening hypotension
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion
   - on CVVH
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone) ending
   [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   - F/u new Gram neg sensitivities
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   - Consider EPO to bolster
   - Add Fe++ po
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, stable
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   - Will hold off until resp status improves
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - No placement of tunneled HD line as pos blood cultures
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   .
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Consider midodrine if pressure supports, otherwise add
   vasopressin if hypotensive
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on ceftriaxone for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate [**Month/Day (4) 1881**].
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem). Day 8 today. Will ask ID about discontinuing.
   - HD line replaced (was accidentally d/c
d while moving patient);
   beneficial if the line was source of fever
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff
   - CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for occult foci of infection
   per ID recs
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - ID c/s for persistent fever
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA and C. diff are likely source.  Lactate [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be indicative
   of decreased end organ perfusion. On Levophed to maintain BP
   - Would add vasopressin if lactate increases further or levophed
   requirement increases >0.15mcg/kg/min
   - on CVVH; run it even while needing pressors
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean
   Levophed
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA.. Patient trached on
   [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able to tolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem), follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - f/u heme recs
   - F/u hemolysis labs
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - continue checking stool guaiac
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time
   - Renal following
   - Continue EPO
   .
   Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation. Frustrated with
   long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Continue midodrine
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   continue erythromycin for bowel motility

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multiorgan failure from CAP pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with Clostridium difficile colitis on PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole; on ceftriaxone for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient had leukocytosis/fever overnight, but is now afebrile. No new microbiology data. Lactate levels are concerning for decreased end-organ perfusion.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Treat new HAP as above with an 8-day course of antibiotics (ceftriaxone -> meropenem), follow-up cultures.
2. HD line replaced (accidentally disconnected while moving the patient); beneficial if the line was a source of fever.
3. On PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. diff colitis.
4. CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for occult foci of infection per ID recs.
5. Consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema.
6. ID c/s for persistent fever.
7. F/u beta-glucan, galactomannan for persistent yeast in urine.
8. Septic Shock/Hypotension: Initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on HD with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl and  HAP GNR with ceftriaxone.
   PLAN:
   .
   Leukocytosis/fever
 progressive since [**4-5**], spiked last two nights
   blood culture NTD, urine showed yeast, sputum showing pansensitive
   serratia and KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA initially colonized and secondarily
   infected on [**4-7**].  Had positive c.diff [**4-8**] in the setting of prolonged
   antibiotic administration. For the repeat PNA on the [**4-7**], there were
   not significant radiographic findings, but with increased secretions
   and needing to be placed back on the vent, started treating for HAP
   with vanco/zosyn, until [**4-10**], when repeat sputum cultures showed GNR
   and stopped vanco and switched zosyn to meropenem. KUB did not show any
   evidence of megacolon. Also will consider non-tunnelled line as source.
   Other source as of [**4-10**] could be from foley, since oliguric, d/c foley
   and will straight cath as needed.
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - treat HAP serratia and klebsiella 8day course ending [**2167-4-15**] was on
   ceftriaxone, currently on meropenem [**4-13**] due to CTX interaction with
   CVVH
   - treat c.diff with PO vanco and IV flagyl 14 days after PNA abx
   stopped -> flagyl changed to TID
   - lactates stable at 2.2
   - ID c/s for persistent fever
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   Initial sputum with GNRs and GPCs in pairs.  Initial PNA treated.  Then
   patient developed what is thought to be VAP, treated until [**4-1**].  He
   was doing well until lsat two days when BPs started to trend downward.
   Thought to possibly due to ativan.  Now with more information, due to
   sepsis from c.diff (see above for infection discussion).  Had SBPs in
   the 50s/30s and change in mental status overnight.
   - Tried dopamine, but weaned off
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   - trend lactates as end measure of end organ perfusion - stable
   - on CVVH
   - Started midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean
   Levophed
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-26**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-28**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-26**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-27**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein, see below. Completed 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem. Patient trached on [**4-1**] and failed PEG. Patient went
   to OR on [**4-3**] for open G-tube placement.  Was doing well on trach mask
   trial until [**4-9**] when he was tachypneic and tiring.
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able totolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem) ending [**2167-4-15**], follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   - F/u new Gram neg sensitivities
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, will not benefit from Iron. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH. Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - heme following
   - F/u hemolysis labs
   - Add Procrit
   - Add Fe++ po
   .
   LUE swelling
 could be in setting of thrombosis from pacer wires
   - LENI is negative, stable
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach, will change on [**4-13**] and then get
   ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   - Will hold off until resp status improves
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection. [**3-31**], placed IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port,
   non-tunneled since was spiking.
   - holding HD today in setting of acute infection, continue to follow up
   renal recs. Since patient on pressors since [**4-8**] in the setting of c
   diff sepsis and VAP, renal restarted CVVH on [**4-10**].
   -  renal giving EPO
   - No placement of tunneled HD line as pos blood cultures
   .
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   -          MS much improved, cont zyprexa as needed for agitation
   .
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn. -   Stopped ACEI in setting of
   hypotension
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Add midodrine
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   add erythromycin for bowel motility

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to pneumonia (PNA) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also had Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR), and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including severe anemia, thrombosis, dysphonia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, oliguric acute on chronic renal failure/uremia, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation and treatment are necessary.
2. Hypotension/Septric Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and septic shock may be due to ongoing infection and inadequate perfusion. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening respiratory status and positive cultures for GNR suggest VAP. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics and consideration of non-tunnelled line as a source are important.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) Colitis: The patient's recent antibiotic administration and positive test for C. diff indicate"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a low ejection fraction (EF 30%). He presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with Clostridium difficile colitis. He has been treated with various antibiotics for different infections, including ceftriaxone, erythromycin, metronidazole, and meropenem. The patient also has severe anemia, likely due to autoimmune hemolysis, and is unable to tolerate blood transfusions. He has been on pressors for hypotension and has had multiple episodes of hypotension and sepsis. There are concerns about possible line infections and the source of infection, with suggestions of a non-tunnelled line or Foley catheter. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and he has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pneumonia. He has had multiple central venous catheters, including a right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter, and has had a tracheostomy tube. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple episodes of sepsis due to various infections, including CAP, VAP, and C."

   CT abdomen with IV contrast [**2167-4-15**], prelim read:
   PFI: Collection of fluid with a few foci of gas situated between the
   duodenum
   and the pancreatic head. The collection is intimately associated with
   the
   duodenum as well as the pancreatic head and uncinate process.
   Diverticulum
   off the second portion of the duodenum is again noted, and is within
   the fluid
   collection.
   CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with PO contrast only, [**2167-4-15**], final read:
   1. Approximately 7.8 cm low-attenuation lesion in the region of the
   second
   and third portion of the duodenum, adjacent to the uncinate process of
   pancreas with multiple pockets of gas. This finding is most consistent
   with
   abscess, possibly from perforated duodenal ulcer or duodenal
   diveritulitis,
   although underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded. Additionally, it is
   difficult
   to assess how much of this lesion represents abscess, underlying
   hematoma, or
   component of known duodenal diverticulum. Further evaluation with
   contrast-
   enhanced study is recommended.
   2. Moderate amount of ascites identified, tracking into the pelvis.
   3. Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
   4. Coronary calcifications are identified.
   5. Exophytic lesion arising from the right kidney and hyperintense
   lesion in
   the left kidney, possibly representing cysts, although these are
   incompletely
   evaluated on this study. Further evaluation with dedicated ultrasound
   is
   recommended when patient is stable.
   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3934**] [**Name (STitle) 3935**], including the assessment and plan. I
   would emphasize and add the following points: 81M DCM (30%), septic
   shock c/b MOSF. Remains on vent, pressors and CVVH with c. diff+ stool.
   Lost HD catheter with movement, agitated / delerious overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.1 BP 95/52 HR 86 VAC 500x14 0.4
   5 7.45/32/82 with sat 98. Frail man, interactive, denies pain. Coarse
   BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 23K, HCT 23,
   K+ 4.4, Cr 1.5. CXR with cardiomegaly, patchy ASD.
   Agree with plan to manage septic shock from c. diff with levophed, TBB
   even, antibiotics and f/u cultures; concern over [**Name (STitle) 1881**] lactate, may
   need to add VPA if levo >0.15. Will continue midodrine in an attempt to
   wean levophed while on CVVH, and will accept SBP>80, MAP>50. Will try
   PSV 15/8 trials, and continue antibiotics x8 days for VAP, to be d/c'ed
   today. For ARF/ESRD, continue CVVH via temp VIP line. Appreciate ID
   input, will obtain pan-scan today to r/o focal collection, which might
   explain ongoing pressor dependence, and will f/u fungal markers. For
   his anemia, will restart epo and start iron PGT, while monitoring for
   hemolysis and continuing folate. Will use zyprexa, rather than benzos,
   to manage delirium. Continue supportive care with TFs, change
   erythromycin to PGT. Above d/w patient, wife and daughter at bedside.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff

   Leukocytosis/fever
 afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate [**Name (STitle) 1881**].
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem). Day 8 today. Will ask ID about discontinuing.
   - HD line replaced (was accidentally d/c
d while moving patient);
   beneficial if the line was source of fever
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff

   PNA and C. diff are likely source.  Lactate [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be indicative
   of decreased end organ perfusion. On Levophed to maintain BP
   - Would add vasopressin if lactate increases further or levophed
   requirement increases >0.15mcg/kg/min
   - on CVVH; run it even while needing pressors
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. Some of these complications include:

1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction. The patient required early goal-directed therapy and was treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and CVVH.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, which is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea and colitis. This infection is commonly associated with antibiotic use and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not treated appropriately.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in individuals who are receiving mechanical ventilation. VAP can be challenging to treat and may require prolonged antibiotic therapy.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has evidence of AKI, characterized by an increase in serum creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). AKI can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or direct kidney injury.

5. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and is DAT positive with many antibodies. This suggests that the patient may have an autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, malnutrition, anxiety, impaired muscle performance, impaired balance, and impaired aerobic capacity. The patient's chief complaint is an abdominal pain. The CT scan of the torso/abdomen shows fluid and air collection associated with the duodenum and head of the pancreas, which raises concerns about a possible perforated duodenal diverticulum or pancreatic pseudocyst with superinfection. Surgery has been consulted.

The patient has received several antibiotic treatments, including ceftriaxone, erythromycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and metronidazole. He is currently on norepinephrine infusion and other ICU medications such as famotidine, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated potassium and lactate levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, and hypotension may indicate an ongoing infection, leading to sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3934**] [**Name (STitle) 3935**], including the assessment and plan. I
   would emphasize and add the following points: 81M DCM (30%), septic
   shock c/b MOSF. Remains on vent, pressors and CVVH with c. diff+ stool.
   Lost HD catheter with movement, agitated / delerious overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.1 BP 95/52 HR 86 VAC 500x14 0.4
   5 7.45/32/82 with sat 98. Frail man, interactive, denies pain. Coarse
   BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 23K, HCT 23,
   K+ 4.4, Cr 1.5. CXR with cardiomegaly, patchy ASD.
   Agree with plan to manage septic shock from c. diff with levophed, TBB

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and tachycardia. He has a fever and increased lactate levels, indicating ongoing sepsis. His mental status is altered, and he is agitated and delirious.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and low hemoglobin. Blood cultures have been obtained to guide further antibiotic therapy. Imaging studies reveal cardiomegaly and patchy airspace disease on chest X-ray.

The patient's plan includes managing septic shock with levophed, TBB even, antibiotics, and follow-up cultures. There is concern about rising lactate levels, which may require the addition of vasopressin if levo >0.15. The team will attempt to wean levophed while on CVVH and accept a systolic blood pressure >80 mmHg and mean arterial pressure >50 mmHg. Polysomnography (PSV) trials will be tried, and antibiotics will be continued for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), to be discontinued today."

   CT abdomen with IV contrast [**2167-4-15**], prelim read:
   PFI: Collection of fluid with a few foci of gas situated between the
   duodenum
   and the pancreatic head. The collection is intimately associated with
   the
   duodenum as well as the pancreatic head and uncinate process.
   Diverticulum
   off the second portion of the duodenum is again noted, and is within
   the fluid
   collection.
   CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with PO contrast only, [**2167-4-15**], final read:
   1. Approximately 7.8 cm low-attenuation lesion in the region of the
   second
   and third portion of the duodenum, adjacent to the uncinate process of
   pancreas with multiple pockets of gas. This finding is most consistent
   with
   abscess, possibly from perforated duodenal ulcer or duodenal
   diveritulitis,
   although underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded. Additionally, it is
   difficult
   to assess how much of this lesion represents abscess, underlying
   hematoma, or
   component of known duodenal diverticulum. Further evaluation with
   contrast-
   enhanced study is recommended.
   2. Moderate amount of ascites identified, tracking into the pelvis.
   3. Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
   4. Coronary calcifications are identified.
   5. Exophytic lesion arising from the right kidney and hyperintense
   lesion in
   the left kidney, possibly representing cysts, although these are
   incompletely
   evaluated on this study. Further evaluation with dedicated ultrasound
   is
   recommended when patient is stable.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate [**Month/Day/Year 1881**].
   - On meropenem Day   HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone
   -> meropenem). Day 8 today. Will ask ID about discontinuing.
   - HD line replaced (was accidentally d/c
d while moving patient);
   beneficial if the line was source of fever
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff
   - CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for occult foci of infection
   per ID recs
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - ID c/s for persistent fever
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA and C. diff are likely source.  Lactate [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be indicative
   of decreased end organ perfusion. On Levophed to maintain BP
   - Would add vasopressin if lactate increases further or levophed
   requirement increases >0.15mcg/kg/min
   - on CVVH; run it even while needing pressors
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean
   Levophed
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA.. Patient trached on
   [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able to tolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem), follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - f/u heme recs
   - F/u hemolysis labs
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - continue checking stool guaiac
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time
   - Renal following
   - Continue EPO
   .
   Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation. Frustrated with
   long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Continue midodrine
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   continue erythromycin for bowel motility

   Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock.
   Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.  PNA and
   C. diff are likely source; fluid/air collection, if indeed an abscess,
   may be contributing. Levophed requirement increasing to maintain BP.
   Shock may be both septic and cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease
   with EF 20-30%).
   - check mixed venous O2 sat
   - Consider use of inotropes to increase cardiac contractility

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has Clostridium difficile colitis. A fluid/air collection adjacent to the duodenum and pancreas is observed on CT scan, which may indicate a pancreatic pseudocyst with superinfection or a perforated duodenal diverticulum. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, blood pressure of 83/45 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on assist-control ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient is initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock, and there may be both septic and cardiogenic causes for the shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3934**] [**Name (STitle) 3935**], including the assessment and plan. I
   would emphasize and add the following points: 81M DCM (30%), septic
   shock c/b MOSF. Remains on vent, pressors and CVVH with c. diff+ stool.
   Lost HD catheter with movement, agitated / delerious overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.1 BP 95/52 HR 86 VAC 500x14 0.4
   5 7.45/32/82 with sat 98. Frail man, interactive, denies pain. Coarse
   BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 23K, HCT 23,
   K+ 4.4, Cr 1.5. CXR with cardiomegaly, patchy ASD.
   Agree with plan to manage septic shock from c. diff with levophed, TBB
   even, antibiotics and f/u cultures; concern over [**Name (STitle) 1881**] lactate, may
   need to add VPA if levo >0.15. Will continue midodrine in an attempt to
   wean levophed while on CVVH, and will accept SBP>80, MAP>50. Will try
   PSV 15/8 trials, and continue antibiotics x8 days for VAP, to be d/c'ed
   today. For ARF/ESRD, continue CVVH via temp VIP line. Appreciate ID
   input, will obtain pan-scan today to r/o focal collection, which might
   explain ongoing pressor dependence, and will f/u fungal markers. For
   his anemia, will restart epo and start iron PGT, while monitoring for
   hemolysis and continuing folate. Will use zyprexa, rather than benzos,
   to manage delirium. Continue supportive care with TFs, change
   erythromycin to PGT. Above d/w patient, wife and daughter at bedside.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on ceftriaxone for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate [**Name (STitle) 1881**].
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem). Day 8 today. Will ask ID about discontinuing.
   - HD line replaced (was accidentally d/c
d while moving patient);
   beneficial if the line was source of fever
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff
   - CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for occult foci of infection
   per ID recs
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - ID c/s for persistent fever
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA and C. diff are likely source.  Lactate [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be indicative
   of decreased end organ perfusion. On Levophed to maintain BP
   - Would add vasopressin if lactate increases further or levophed
   requirement increases >0.15mcg/kg/min
   - on CVVH; run it even while needing pressors
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean
   Levophed
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA.. Patient trached on
   [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able to tolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem), follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.

   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with initial admission with sepsis attributable to pulmonary
   source who has had proloned coure complicated by persistent renal
   failure and hypotension.
   1)Respiratory Failiure--likely secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **] in the setting of
   sepsis.  Secondary insult of VAP (Serratia/Klebsiella) is likely source
   of continued failure.  He has persistent high ventilatory requirements
   but actually has been able to tolerate PSV intermittently
   -PSV trial today
   2)Sepsis-Continued insult with C. Diff colitis and possibly significant
   fluid collection in abdomen
does appear to be in a challenging location
   for tap.  Of note Lactate has decreased.
   -Levophed continued
   -Midodrine
   -Meropenem
for VAP
   -PO vanc/IV Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Will look to IR for possible tap of fluid collection in the setting of
   persistent sepsis and given CT scan findings.  Given difficulty with
   obtaining sample would consider Rx with Caspofungin and will have to
   coordinate with ID for choice on treatment and Renal for dosing if
   pursued.
   3)Renal Failiure-
   -Epogen
   -CVVH to continue
   -Goal negative fluid balance
   -Continue with change to Dobutamine today with goal for diuresis
   4)Altered Mental Status-
   -Olanzapine as needed
   -Improved this am
   -PRN medications and minimize sedation

   CT abdomen [**2167-4-15**] Final read
   FINDINGS: Again seen, but better defined, is a collection of fluid
   containing
   a few small foci of gas. It is located between the second and third
   portions
   of the duodenum and the pancreatic head and uncinate process. The
   patient's
   previously seen duodenal diverticulum projects into this collection off
   the
   second portion of the duodenum. The collection measures approximately
   5.6 x
   5.4 x 6.9 cm.
   The pancreatic head and uncinate process appear somewhat indistinct.
   They may
   be either atrophic or potentially involved with the above-described
   inflammatory process.
   The visualized portion of the liver is unremarkable. The patient is
   status
   post cholecystectomy. Kidneys appear somewhat atrophic. Note is made of
   a
   hyperdense lesion off the inferior pole of the left kidney. Renal cyst
   is
   noted on the right. There is no hydronephrosis. Atheromatous
   calcifications
   of the abdominal aorta are noted. There is ascites, mild in severity.
   Subcutaneous edema is noted.
   Adrenals are unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Fluid collection containing small bubbles of gas as described above,
   situated between the duodenum and pancreatic head and uncinate process.
   Differential considerations include perforation of a duodenal ulcer or
   duodenal diverticulum with resultant abscess. Much less likely, given
   the
   proximity of the pancreas, a pancreatic process such as an infected
   pseudocyst
   (given the presence of gas) is a differential consideration. No
   definite mass
   is identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 Afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate now back down to 2.  CT torso showing a fluid/air collection in
   duodenum adj to pancreas. Fluconazole was added yesterday for fungal
   coverage.
   - IR drainage of the fluid collection today after reversing INR
   - On meropenem Day  10 for the lastest HAP
 Pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH).
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff (Day 5 today)
   - f/u ID recs
   - galactomannin neg. beta-glucan was cancelled, hemolyzed.
   .
   Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock.
   Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.  PNA and
   C. diff are likely source; fluid/air collection, if indeed an abscess,
   may be contributing. Levophed requirement increasing to maintain BP.
   Shock may be both septic and cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease
   with EF 20-30%).
   - mixed venous O2 sat was checked- 96%-- erroneous?
   - Consider use of inotropes to increase cardiac contractility
   - on CVVH; try gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is extremely
   volume overloaded (however limited by low BP)
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**]. On
   Vent, Assist Control
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able to tolerate a few hours before tiring
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Continue EPO
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; increased folate 1mg to 4mg Qday
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: Appears to be have been caused by shock liver. Platelets

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with Clostridium difficile colitis on oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole; on meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 108/48 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 96%, which may be erroneous. The patient is receiving norepinephrine at 0.12 mcg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.8 K/uL and fever. The patient is afebrile overnight. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, which could be an abscess. The patient has been started on fluconazole for fungal coverage.

The patient's coagulopathy appears to be caused by shock liver, with an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 27"

   CT abdomen [**2167-4-15**] Final read
   FINDINGS: Again seen, but better defined, is a collection of fluid
   containing
   a few small foci of gas. It is located between the second and third
   portions
   of the duodenum and the pancreatic head and uncinate process. The
   patient's
   previously seen duodenal diverticulum projects into this collection off
   the
   second portion of the duodenum. The collection measures approximately
   5.6 x
   5.4 x 6.9 cm.
   The pancreatic head and uncinate process appear somewhat indistinct.
   They may
   be either atrophic or potentially involved with the above-described
   inflammatory process.
   The visualized portion of the liver is unremarkable. The patient is
   status
   post cholecystectomy. Kidneys appear somewhat atrophic. Note is made of
   a
   hyperdense lesion off the inferior pole of the left kidney. Renal cyst
   is
   noted on the right. There is no hydronephrosis. Atheromatous
   calcifications
   of the abdominal aorta are noted. There is ascites, mild in severity.
   Subcutaneous edema is noted.
   Adrenals are unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Fluid collection containing small bubbles of gas as described above,
   situated between the duodenum and pancreatic head and uncinate process.
   Differential considerations include perforation of a duodenal ulcer or
   duodenal diverticulum with resultant abscess. Much less likely, given
   the
   proximity of the pancreas, a pancreatic process such as an infected
   pseudocyst
   (given the presence of gas) is a differential consideration. No
   definite mass
   is identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 Afebrile overnight. Lactate fluctuating, currently
   3. CT torso showing a fluid/air collection in duodenum adj to pancreas.
   Fluconazole was added yesterday for fungal coverage.
   - IR drainage of the fluid collection today after reversing INR (will
   need FFP prior to procedure; will likely need 4 units with goal INR <2)
   - On meropenem Day  10 for the lastest HAP
 Pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH).
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff (Day 5 today)
   - f/u ID recs
   - galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.
   .
   Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock.
   Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.  PNA and
   C. diff are likely source; fluid/air collection, if indeed an abscess,
   may be contributing. Levophed requirement increasing to maintain BP.
   Shock may be both septic and cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease
   with EF 20-30%).
   - mixed venous O2 sat was checked- 96%-- erroneous?
   - Consider use of inotropes to increase cardiac contractility- if
   levophed requirement goes up, add vasopressin.
   - on CVVH; try gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is extremely
   volume overloaded (however limited by low BP)
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**]. On
   Vent, Assist Control
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Continue EPO
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; increased folate 1mg to 4mg Qday
   .
   Coagulopathy: Appears to be have been caused by shock liver. Platelets
   gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay. No evidence
   of DIC. INR increasing.
   Coagulopathy needs to be at least partially reversed before IR drainage
   of abdominal fluid collection. Received Vit K IV (gut absorption of PO
   Vitamin K may be inadequate) however INR not decreasing appropriately.
   - Give FFP for IR procedure today.
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation at this time.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at
   moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 Afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate now back down to 2.  CT torso showing a fluid/air collection in
   duodenum adj to pancreas
   - Arrange for IR drainage of the fluid collection
   - On meropenem Day  9 for the lastest HAP
 Pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH).
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff (Day 4 today)
   - f/u ID recs
 ask about adding a fungal coverage
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock.
   Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.  PNA and
   C. diff are likely source; fluid/air collection, if indeed an abscess,
   may be contributing. Levophed requirement increasing to maintain BP.
   Shock may be both septic and cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease
   with EF 20-30%).
   - check mixed venous O2 sat
   - Consider use of inotropes to increase cardiac contractility
   - on CVVH; try gentle diuresis 50cc/hr off since pt is extremely volume
   overloaded (while monitoring BP closely)
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**]. On
   Vent, Assist Control
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able to tolerate a few hours before tiring
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Continue EPO
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; increased folate 1mg to 4mg Qday
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8155**] [**4-4**].  Needs
   to be at least partially reversed before IR drainage of abdominal fluid
   collection
   - following daily
   - continue checking stool guaiac
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation at this time.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at
   moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who is currently in the ICU for septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with Clostridium difficile colitis, and has been receiving vancomycin and metronidazole for the C. diff infection. He is also on meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to pansensitive Serratia and Klebsiella.

The patient's recent events include being afebrile overnight, with no new microbiology data. His lactate levels have decreased, but there is a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, which needs to be addressed. The plan is to arrange for interventional radiology (IR) drainage of the fluid collection. 

The patient's current medical issues include shock/hypotension, respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), oliguric acute on chronic renal failure/uremia, anemia, dysphonia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, and mental status changes.

The patient's physical examination reveals vital signs within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly low blood pressure. His arterial line was started on 04/16/2167 at 05:33 PM. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, anemia, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status (not delirium), malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and ARDS. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high INR value indicating a bleeding risk. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate measures to prevent bleeding events should be taken.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient's history of recent antibiotic use increases the risk for C. diff infection. Monitoring for symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever is essential.
3. Chronic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload or other contributing factors. Regular monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
4. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia. Further evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate management is required.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for pressure ulcers. Frequent repositioning, proper skin care, and use of pressure-relieving devices are crucial.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multiorgan failure, and complications including c. diff colitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a fungal abdominal abscess. The patient's condition has been complex and requires careful management of various medical complications.

1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which required early goal-directed therapy. Despite this, the patient remains hypotensive, and there is an ongoing concern for both septic and cardiogenic shock. The mixed venous O2 saturation is low at 52%, indicating poor tissue perfusion. Consideration should be given to the use of inotropes to increase cardiac contractility, especially if levophed requirement increases. Vasopressin may also be considered in this scenario. Gentle diuresis should be continued, but limited by low blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA, requiring mechanical ventilation. Pressure support ventilation trials should be continued as tolerated. 

3. Oliguric, Acute on Chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure, likely due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis. CVVH is currently being used for renal support. Renal function should be closely monitored, and the patient should continue to receive erythropoietin (EPO).

4. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, most likely due to chronic disease and hemolysis. Only emergency transfusions should be given in settings of active ischemia. The patient also has antibodies against donor blood, so blood transfusions should be limited. Folate supplementation should be increased.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient appears to have a coagulopathy likely caused by shock liver and subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The platelet count is decreasing, and the INR is increasing. The patient is also positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). If coagulation parameters normalize, Argatroban may be considered as an anticoagulant.

6. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis likely due to shock liver. RUQ ultrasound shows known common bile duct dilation, which is stable.

7. Dysphonia: The patient has dysphonia due to a cuffed tracheostomy tube. The cuff size should be reduced once respiratory status improves.

8. Mental Status: The patient is alert and oriented but can be delirious at times. Frequent reorientation and maintaining a sleep-wake cycle are recommended.

9. Cardiovascular: The patient's cardiovascular system is stable. CK levels are elevated due to hypovolemia and shock. No ischemic EKG changes have been noted.

10. CABG: The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been diagnosed with a fungal upper abdominal abscess, for which he is being treated with fluconazole. The patient is also suffering from Clostridium difficile colitis and has been on vancomycin and metronidazole. He has been on meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to pansensitive Serratia and Klebsiella. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he requires norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. He is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has severe anemia with positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and will only be transfused in emergency settings. He is also experiencing coagulopathy with elevated INR and PTT, likely due to subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's mental status is fluctuating between alertness and delirium. His cardiac function is compromised with an ejection fraction (EF) of 29%. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Multiorgan failure: The patient has already developed multiorgan failure, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and hematological dysfunction.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's CAP has complicated into VAP, which can increase the risk of mortality.
4. Fungal infection: The patient has a fungal upper abdominal abscess, and there is a risk of further dissemination or development of antifungal resistance.
5. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis, and there is a risk of recurrence or complications such as toxic megacolon.
6. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has developed HAP, which can be caused by drug-resistant organisms and may be difficult to treat.
7. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing AKI, which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.
8. Anemia: The patient has severe anemia, and ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells may worsen his condition.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for HAP, fluconazole for
   fungal upper abd abcess.
   Leukocytosis/fever
 Afebrile overnight. Lactate fluctuating, currently
   3. CT torso showing a fluid/air collection in duodenum adj to pancreas.
   Fluconazole was added [**4-16**] for fungal coverage. Will continue as abcess
   growing yeast.
   - IR drainage of the fluid collection today after reversing INR (will
   need FFP prior to procedure; will likely need 4 units with goal INR <2)
   - On meropenem Day [**12-26**] for the latest HAP
 Pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH).
   - on PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff (Day [**8-21**] today)
   - On Fluconazole (Day 3) for fungal abcess.
   - f/u ID recs
   - galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.
   .
   Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic shock.
   Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.  PNA, C.
   diff, intra-abdominal abcess are likely sources. Levophed requirement
   increasing to maintain BP. Shock may be both septic and cardiogenic (pt
   has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%).
   - mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked- 52%
   - Consider use of inotropes to increase cardiac contractility- if
   levophed requirement goes up, add vasopressin.
   - on CVVH; try gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is extremely
   volume overloaded (however limited by low BP) Consider increasing
   levophed to allow for more aggressive diuresis.
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**]. On
   Vent, Assist Control
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Continue EPO
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis b/c low hapto, high LDH,
   high D Bili. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Patient likely has subacute
   DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; increased folate 1mg to 4mg Qday
   .
   Coagulopathy: Appears to be have been caused by shock liver. Platelets
   gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay. INR
   increasing. Patient likely with subacute DIC. Also found to be HIT+
   yesterday. Per heme, will check serotonin release assay for
   confirmation and monitor INR/PTT.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - If coags normalize, will consider starting Argatroban
   .
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation at this time.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at
   moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Continue midodrine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP. The patient is currently on CVVH and has c. diff colitis. The patient also has a fungal upper abdominal abscess and is being treated with fluconazole. Leukocytosis/fever has subsided overnight, but lactate levels are fluctuating. A CT torso showed a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas. An IR drainage of the fluid collection was performed today after reversing INR, and the patient will likely need FFP prior to the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. Early goal-directed therapy was initiated, and the patient is currently on CVVH with gentle diuresis of 50cc negative/hr. The mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked at 52%. Consideration should be given to using inotropes to increase cardiac contractility, especially if levophed requirement increases. Vasopressin may also be considered if necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA. The patient is intubated and on assist control ventilation. Pressure support ventilation trials should be attempted as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for VAP, fluconazole for
   fungal upper abd abcess.
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x48h. Lactate fluctuating, currently
   3.1. CT torso showing a fluid/air collection in duodenum, adj to
   pancreas, drained with IR on [**4-17**] with pigtail placement, and gram stain
   shows budding yeast.. Fluconazole was added [**4-16**] for fungal coverage.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.
   - On meropenem Day [**12-26**] for the latest HAP
 Pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH). Plan to
   d/c meropenem today.
   - on PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff (Day [**8-21**] today)
   - On Fluconazole (Day 3) for fungal abcess.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u surgery recs for further management upper abd abcess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abcess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement increasing to maintain BP. Shock may be both septic and
   cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%). Currently
   on levophed and midodrine.
   - Mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked- 52%. Consider use of inotropes if
   levophed requirement increases.
   - on CVVH; try gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is extremely
   volume overloaded (however limited by low BP). Consider increasing
   levophed during dialysis to allow for more aggressive diuresis.
   - Once negative fluid goal met (-1 to 2L), trial weaning levophed.
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Start Neutra-phos today per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis b/c low hapto, high LDH,
   high D Bili. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Patient likely has subacute
   DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today.  Post-transfusion Hct check.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; increased folate 1mg to 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   INR increasing. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin
   release assay for confirmation and monitor INR/PTT.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - If coags normalize (PTT <60), will consider starting Argatroban
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation x48 hours.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at
   moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Continue midodrine

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to CAP (pneumonia) complicated by VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). He has a history of c. diff colitis, upper abdominal abscess, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), receiving meropenem for VAP, fluconazole for fungal abdominal abscess, and vancomycin and IV flagyl for c. diff. He also has severe anemia, likely due to subacute DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), and is positive for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The patient's mental status is alert and oriented, but he may experience delirium at times.

Potential medical complications:
1. Shock/hypotension: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is likely both septic and cardiogenic in nature due to his ischemic heart disease. He requires Levophed and midodrine to maintain blood pressure.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA (pneumonia). He is intubated and on assist control ventilation. Pressure support ventilation trials are being attempted as tolerated.
3. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/uremia: The patient is in acute renal failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, ejection fraction of 30%, who is currently in the ICU due to septic shock and multiorgan failure from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need attention.

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. He received early goal-directed therapy with an Apache IV score of 114. The possible sources of shock include PNA, C. diff, and intra-abdominal abscess. The patient is currently on levophed and midodrine.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA and is tracheostomized. He is on assisted control ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Pressure support ventilation trials are planned as tolerated.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient was afebrile for 48 hours, but now has fluctuating lactate levels. A CT torso showed a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, which was drained with interventional radiology on [**4-17**]. The gram stain showed budding yeast, indicating a fungal infection. Fluconazole was added on [**4-16**] for fungal coverage.

4. Oliguric, Acute on Chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient's baseline creatinine is 2.3, and he is in acute renal failure from acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease with limited benefit from iron supplementation. He has evidence of hemolysis due to low haptoglobin, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and high total bilirubin. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was initially positive but negative on repeat testing. The patient should only be transfused in emergency settings of active ischemia, as he likely has subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

6. Coagulopathy: The patient likely has coagulopathy due to shock liver, subacute DIC, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). His platelets are gradually decreasing, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is increasing. He tested positive for HIT on [**4-18**]. The serotonin release assay will be checked for confirmation, and he will be monitored for INR/PTT.

7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis likely due to shock liver in the setting of distributive shock with decreased ejection fraction."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for VAP, fluconazole for
   fungal upper abd abcess.
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x48h. Lactate fluctuating, currently
   3.1. CT torso showing a fluid/air collection in duodenum, adj to
   pancreas, drained with IR on [**4-17**] with pigtail placement, and gram stain
   shows budding yeast.. Fluconazole was added [**4-16**] for fungal coverage.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.
   - On meropenem Day [**12-26**] for the latest HAP
 Pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH). Plan to
   d/c meropenem today.
   - on PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff (Day [**8-21**] today)
   - On Fluconazole (Day 3) for fungal abcess.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u surgery recs for further management upper abd abcess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abcess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement increasing to maintain BP. Shock may be both septic and
   cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%). Currently
   on levophed and midodrine.
   - Mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked- 52%. Consider use of inotropes if
   levophed requirement increases.
   - on CVVH; try gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is extremely
   volume overloaded (however limited by low BP). Consider increasing
   levophed during dialysis to allow for more aggressive diuresis.
   - Once negative fluid goal met (-1 to 2L), trial weaning levophed.
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Start Neutra-phos today per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis b/c low hapto, high LDH,
   high D Bili. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Patient likely has subacute
   DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today.  Post-transfusion Hct check.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; increased folate 1mg to 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   INR increasing. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin
   release assay for confirmation and monitor INR/PTT.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - If coags normalize (PTT <60), will consider starting Argatroban
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation x48 hours.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious at
   moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Continue midodrine

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has Clostridium difficile colitis, for which he is receiving oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. He also has a fungal upper abdominal abscess and is being treated with fluconazole.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient is afebrile for the past 48 hours, but his lactate levels are fluctuating. A CT scan of the torso shows a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, which was drained with percutaneous irrigation on [4-17]. Gram stain of the drainage shows budding yeast, indicating a fungal infection. Fluconazole was added on [4-16] for fungal coverage. The beta-glucan test was canceled due to a hemolyzed sample.
2. Shock/hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. He received early goal-directed therapy, and his Apache IV score was 114.

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and pressure ulcers.
4. Further deterioration of renal function leading to acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to ongoing sepsis and underlying comorbidities.
6. Progression of heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock.
7. Complications related to C. difficile infection, including severe colitis and toxic megacolon.
8. Hypotension and hemodynamic instability due to sepsis and chronic heart failure.
9. Impaired wound healing and"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH. Current
   infectious issues include C. diff colitis and upper abdominal fungal
   abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abcess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement decreased overnight. Shock may be both septic and
   cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%). Currently
   on levophed and midodrine.
   - Mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked- 52%. Consider use of inotropes if
   levophed requirement increases.
   - on CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is
   extremely volume overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   - A-line d/c
d on [**4-19**], unable to get very accurate [**Last Name (LF) 8356**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] try
   other extremities to continue BP monitoring. SBP goal > 70 on NIV BP
   cuff. Hard to justify another a-line placement as patient
s mental
   status is baseline
 unable to gauge with UOP.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. 28 Liters positive for length of stay at
   highest point.
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated. [**Month (only) 60**] tolerate it
   better with continued diuresis.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x72h. Lactate fluctuating, 2-3 range.
   CT torso showed a fluid/air collection in duodenum, adj to pancreas, so
   it was drained with IR on [**4-17**] with pigtail placement, and gram stain
   shows budding yeast.. Fluconazole was added [**4-16**] for fungal coverage.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.
   - Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella HAP (Was on ceftriaxone however interacts with CVVH)
   yesterday
   - Meropenem restarted for peritoneal fluid positive for GNR on [**4-19**] (day
   2 - [**4-20**])
   - on PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when Meropenem is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper
   to prevent recurrence.
   - On Fluconazole (Day 3) for fungal abscess per ID recs.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u surgery recs for further management upper abd abcess
 would like
   to feed patient through G-tube
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Started Neutra-phos yesterday per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure due to CAP (pneumonia) complicated by VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). The patient also has C. diff colitis and an upper abdominal fungal abscess. 

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. He received early goal-directed therapy, and his Apache IV score was 114. PNA, C. diff, and intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. Levophed requirement decreased overnight. Shock may be both septic and cardiogenic (due to ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%). The patient is currently on levophed and midodrine.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA. He is intubated and on assist control ventilation with a 28 liter bag. Pressure support ventilation trials are being attempted as tolerated.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has been afebrile for 72 hours, but his lactate levels are fluctuating between 2-3. A CT scan showed a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, which was drained with IR on 4/17. Gram stain showed budding yeast, and flu"

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multiorgan failure, C. diff colitis, and an upper abdominal fungal abscess. He is currently on CVVH, experiencing oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, anemia of chronic disease, subacute DIC, and HIT. The patient's condition is complex, involving various organ systems and requiring multiple interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which may be both septic and cardiogenic in nature. He requires continuous monitoring and management of his blood pressure, possibly with the use of inotropes and diuretics.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to pneumonia, for which he has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Pressure support ventilation trials should be continued as tolerated, considering ongoing diuresis.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: Although the patient has been afebrile for the past 48 hours, his lactate levels are fluctuating. Close monitoring is required, and further investigation into the source of infection is necessary.

4. Oliguric, Acute on Chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient's renal function is compromised due to acute tubular necrosis. He is currently on CVVH and should continue gentle diuresis while closely monitoring blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement decreased overnight from 0.07->0.05. Shock may be both
   septic and cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%,
   MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**]). Currently on levophed and midodrine. Has been
   difficult to wean levophed in setting of CVVH. Also unsure if BP
   measurements are accurate as have not been able to obtain invasive
   monitoring and currently only [**Location (un) 308**] off right forearm BP cuff. Mental
   status appears more clear than what would be expected for SBPs in the
   80s.
   - Check thigh/calf pressures today. If these SBP > 110s, will rapidly
   wean levophed.
   - Recheck MvO2 today. If low, consider starting dobutamine vs.
   vasopressin.
   - On CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is volume
   overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. 26L positive for length of stay at highest
   point.
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated. [**Month (only) 60**] tolerate it
   better with continued diuresis.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 4days. Lactate fluctuating, [**3-17**]
   range. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella HAP. CT torso showed a fluid/air collection in duodenum, adj
   to pancreas, so it was drained with IR on [**4-17**] with pigtail placement,
   and gram stain shows budding yeast, pan-sensitive Serratia.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess.
   - Added Cefepime and d/c
d Meropenem for pan-sensitive serratia on [**4-20**]
   (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - On Fluconazole (Day 6) for fungal abscess per ID recs.
   - F/U speciation of yeast and adjust anti-fungals as needed.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u surgery recs for further management upper abd abcess
 recommend
   advancing Gtube to G-J for post-abcess feeds.
   - f/u IR recs for drain flushes and need for further abd imaging.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time. Will continue on CVVH until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Should still only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia.
   Patient likely has subacute DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 1 U frozen
   for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   INR increasing. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin
   release assay for confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. **Pt needs separate
   order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban.
   PTT is < 60, but risks for bleeding in this pt if on Argatroban are
   substantial, and will thus wait for SRA result. Appreciate further heme
   recs.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for at least 4
   days. Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious
   at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above. Last transfusion 1U PRBCs [**4-18**].
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and ejection fraction of 30% who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with ongoing pressor requirement. He has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/gamma-neg. abscess. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. There is a concern for both septic and cardiogenic shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient is currently on levophed and midodrine, and it has been difficult to wean off levophed due to CVVH. The mental status appears more clear than expected for the blood pressure readings in the 80s. 
- Check thigh/calf pressures today. If these SBP > 110s, will rapidly wean levophed.
- Recheck MvO2 today. If low, consider starting dobutamine vs. vasopressin.
- Continue CVVH and gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is volume overloaded.
- Wean lev"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH. Current
   infectious issues include C. diff colitis and upper abdominal
   fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement decreased overnight. Shock may be both septic and
   cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%). Currently
   on levophed and midodrine. Has been difficult to wean levophed in
   setting of CVVH.
   - Mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked- 52% [**2166-4-18**]. Consider use of
   inotropes if levophed requirement increases.
   - On CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is
   extremely volume overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID
   - A-line d/c
d on [**4-19**], unable to get very accurate [**Last Name (LF) 8356**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] try
   other extremities to continue BP monitoring. SBP goal > 70 on NIV BP
   cuff. Hard to justify another a-line placement as patient
s mental
   status is baseline
 unable to gauge with UOP.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. 26L positive for length of stay at highest
   point.
   - Pressure support ventilation trials as tolerated. [**Month (only) 60**] tolerate it
   better with continued diuresis.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x72h. Lactate fluctuating, 2-3 range.
   CT torso showed a fluid/air collection in duodenum, adj to pancreas, so
   it was drained with IR on [**4-17**] with pigtail placement, and gram stain
   shows budding yeast, pan-sensitive Serratia. Galactomannin negative;
   beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole
   [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive Serratia and
   Klebsiella HAP
   - Added Cefepime and d/c
d Meropenem for pan-sensitive serratia on [**4-20**]
   (Day 1 [**2167-4-20**])
   - on PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when Meropenem is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper
   to prevent recurrence.
   - On Fluconazole (Day 4) for fungal abscess per ID recs.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u surgery recs for further management upper abd abcess
 and timing
   of restarting tube feeds.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
  Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Should still only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia.
   Patient likely has subacute DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 1 U frozen
   for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   INR increasing. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin
   release assay for confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. INR 2.0 but PTT
   39.7 today.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].

   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for at least 72
   hours. Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious
   at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB

   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH. Current
   infectious issues include C. diff colitis and upper abdominal
   fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement decreased overnight. Shock may be both septic and
   cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%). Currently
   on levophed and midodrine. Has been difficult to wean levophed in
   setting of CVVH.
   - Mixed venous O2 sat was rechecked- 52% [**2166-4-18**]. Consider use of
   inotropes if levophed requirement increases.
   - On CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is
   extremely volume overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Wean levophed as tolerated

","The patient is a 81-year-old male with ischemic heart disease and a baseline ejection fraction of 30% who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive due to septic shock, which is likely caused by the pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, and possibly cardiogenic factors due to his ischemic heart disease. He is currently on norepinephrine and midodrine to maintain blood pressure.

2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to the CAP. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient had leukocytosis and fever, which is consistent with an ongoing infection. His temperature has been afebrile for the past 72 hours.

4. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) on top of chronic kidney disease (CKD). His baseline creatinine was 2.3, and he is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease with evidence of ongoing hemolysis. He should only be transfused"

   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. Levophed
   requirement decreased overnight from 0.07->0.05. Shock may be both
   septic and cardiogenic (pt has ischemic heart disease with EF 20-30%,
   MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**]). Currently on levophed and midodrine. Has been
   difficult to wean levophed in setting of CVVH. Also unsure if BP
   measurements are accurate as have not been able to obtain invasive
   monitoring and currently only [**Location (un) 308**] off right forearm BP cuff. Mental
   status appears more clear than what would be expected for SBPs in the
   80s.
   - Check thigh/calf pressures today. If these SBP > 110s, will rapidly
   wean levophed.
   - Recheck MvO2 today. If low, consider starting dobutamine vs.
   vasopressin.
   - On CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is volume
   overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP. He is currently on CVVH with ongoing pressor requirement. The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. He has been receiving early goal-directed therapy, but his blood pressure measurements may not be accurate due to the absence of invasive monitoring. Weaning of levophed and consideration of starting dobutamine or vasopressin should be considered.

2. Resp failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA. He is intubated and on assist control ventilation. Pressure support ventilation trials should be continued as tolerated.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient was previously febrile but is now afebrile for four days. Lactate levels have been fluctuating. He has completed 11 days of meropenem for pansensitive Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. A CT scan showed a fluid/air collection in the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas, which was drained with IR on [date]. The gram stain of the drainage showed budding yeast, pan-sensitive Serratia. Fluconazole and cefepime were started, and the patient is currently on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. diff.

4. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient has acute tubular necrosis and is on CVVH. Renal function should continue to be closely monitored.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, but there is limited benefit from iron supplementation. However, it is safe to give it. Folate levels are normal, B12 levels are high, and there is evidence of ongoing hemolysis. The patient tested positive for super Coombs but was negative on repeat testing. Only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient likely has subacute DIC and HIT. Platelets are gradually decreasing, and INR is increasing. The patient should have daily platelet counts, and further heme recommendations should be followed.

7. Transaminitis: This is likely due to shock liver in the setting of distributive picture with decreased EF. RUQ ultrasound shows known CBD dilation, which was stable after cholecystectomy.

8. Dysphonia: This is due to the cuffed tracheostomy tube. It is important to hold off changing to a smaller cuff until respiratory status improves.

9. Mental Status: The patient is alert and oriented x3, with clear mentation for at least four days. He may experience delirium at moments"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Levophed and midodrine weaned overnight and 1.5L removed w/
   CVVH yesterday, however lactate rose to 5.9 w/ decreasing mental
   status. Restarted levophed at 0.2mcg/kg this AM for SBPs in 60s.
   - Trial dobutamine for probable cardiogenic component to ongoing
   hypotension.
   - Will hold CVVH during dobutamine trial and plan to restart tonight.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 55, SPB 90.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trials yesterday but then
   required MMV for apnea and Assist Control after midnight.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled this AM to
   5.9, repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing budding yeast,
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Continue Fluconazole (Day 7) for fungal abscess.
   - F/U speciation of yeast and adjust anti-fungals as needed.
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time, holding temporarily during dobutamine trial. Will
   continue on CVVH until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Will not repeat Super Coombs per Heme. Should still only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient likely has subacute DIC.
   Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25, but Hct down
   again today to 22.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Transfused 1U today and check post-transfusion Hct.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin release assay for
   confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. **Pt needs separate order for
   platelet count daily.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban.
   PTT is < 60, but risks for bleeding in this pt if on Argatroban are
   substantial, and will thus wait for SRA result. Appreciate further heme
   recs.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for past 4
   days, unless more somnolent this AM off pressors. Frustrated with long
   ICU stay and illness. Will reassess mental status when back on pressors
   later today.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine/dobutamine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP. He has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/GNR abscess. The patient is currently on CVVH with ongoing pressor requirement and has a cardiac ejection fraction of 30%. He is also experiencing oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, anemia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, dysphonia, mental status changes, CV stability, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock and had early goal-directed therapy. However, the patient's cardiogenic component to shock needs to be addressed with a trial of dobutamine. This may require holding CVVH temporarily and restarting it later.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA and is on assist control ventilation. Pressure support trials should continue as tolerated.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's lactate levels have increased, indicating a possible recurrence of infection. Repeat blood cultures should be sent, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued.
4. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/uremia: The patient's baseline creatinine is 2.3, and he is in ARF from acute tub"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart disease with EF
   20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had A-line pulled on
   [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure monitoring; unsure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Mentating well with SBPs in 80s.
   Levophed and midodrine weaned overnight; no longer requiring pressors.
   Able to remove ___ fluid with CVVH yesterday. Lactate elevated at 5.9
   this morning.
   - On CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is volume
   overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 50-55.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trials yesterday but then
   required MMV for apnea.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled this AM to
   5.9, repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing budding yeast,
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Continue Fluconazole (Day 7) for fungal abscess.
   - F/U speciation of yeast and adjust anti-fungals as needed.
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time. Will continue on CVVH until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Should still only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia.
   Patient likely has subacute DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 1 U frozen
   for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - F/U Super Coombs test from Blood Bank.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin release assay for
   confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. **Pt needs separate order for
   platelet count daily.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban.
   PTT is < 60, but risks for bleeding in this pt if on Argatroban are
   substantial, and will thus wait for SRA result. Appreciate further heme
   recs.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for at least 4
   days. Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious
   at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above. Last transfusion 1U PRBCs [**4-18**].
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.
   .
   FEN
 Holding TFs per surgery. Replete lytes PRN. Place G-J w/ IR today
   for post-abscess feeds.

","The patient's chief complaint is septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 30%, and there is also a cardiogenic component to the shock. The patient has been treated for various conditions including C. difficile colitis, intra-abdominal fungal/Gram-negative bacterial abscess, and multiorgan failure.

The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with ongoing pressor requirement. They have been hypotensive and required early goal-directed therapy. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by ARDS secondary to pneumonia, and they have been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support trials as tolerated.

The patient has leukocytosis and fever, and there is a concern for ongoing infection. They have been treated with multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and fluconazole. The patient also has anemia of chronic disease, ongoing hemolysis, and a positive Super Coombs test initially, which later turned negative. They have been transfused with packed red blood cells.

The patient has a coagulopathy likely due to shock liver, subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). They have been found to be HIT positive, and their platelet count has been decreasing over time.

The patient also has transaminitis likely due to shock liver, dysphonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and anxiety. The patient's current condition is unstable with altered mental status, impaired balance, muscle performance, and ventilation. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on pressors for hemodynamic support. The patient's blood cultures have shown an increase in lactate levels, indicating ongoing tissue perfusion abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of septic shock indicates a systemic infection that may lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT/PTT/INR suggests a coagulation disorder, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to decreased renal perfusion in the setting of sepsis.
5. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's pre-existing heart condition can be exacerbated by sepsis and fluid shifts.
6. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's anemia may progress if the underlying cause is not addressed.
7. Malnutrition: Prolonged ICU stay and impaired"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Levophed and midodrine weaned overnight and 1.5L removed w/
   CVVH yesterday, however lactate rose to 5.9 w/ decreasing mental
   status. Restarted levophed at 0.2mcg/kg this AM for SBPs in 60s.
   - Trial dobutamine for probable cardiogenic component to ongoing
   hypotension.
   - Will hold CVVH during dobutamine trial and plan to restart tonight.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 55, SPB 90.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trials yesterday but then
   required MMV for apnea and Assist Control after midnight.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled this AM to
   5.9, repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing budding yeast,
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Continue Fluconazole (Day 7) for fungal abscess.
   - F/U speciation of yeast and adjust anti-fungals as needed.
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time, holding temporarily during dobutamine trial. Will
   continue on CVVH until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Will not repeat Super Coombs per Heme. Should still only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient likely has subacute DIC.
   Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25, but Hct down
   again today to 22.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Transfused 1U today and check post-transfusion Hct.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin release assay for
   confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. **Pt needs separate order for
   platelet count daily.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban.
   PTT is < 60, but risks for bleeding in this pt if on Argatroban are
   substantial, and will thus wait for SRA result. Appreciate further heme
   recs.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for past 4
   days, unless more somnolent this AM off pressors. Frustrated with long
   ICU stay and illness. Will reassess mental status when back on pressors
   later today.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine/dobutamine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with ongoing pressor requirements.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. He had early goal-directed therapy and is currently on pressors to maintain blood pressure. There is also a cardiogenic component to the shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA. He is intubated and on assist control ventilation. Pressure support trials have been attempted, but the patient requires MMV for apnea and assist control after midnight.
3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient is afebrile for the past five days, but his lactate levels have doubled to 5.9. A repeat blood culture has been sent. The patient has completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources. [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart disease with EF
   20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had A-line pulled on
   [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure monitoring; unsure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Mentating well with SBPs in 80s.
   Levophed and midodrine weaned overnight; no longer requiring pressors.
   Able to remove ___ fluid with CVVH yesterday. Lactate elevated at 5.9
   this morning.
   - On CVVH; continuing gentle diuresis of 50cc neg/hr since pt is volume
   overloaded (however limited by low BP).
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 50-55.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trials yesterday but then
   required MMV for apnea.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled this AM to
   5.9, repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing budding yeast,
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Continue Fluconazole (Day 7) for fungal abscess.
   - F/U speciation of yeast and adjust anti-fungals as needed.
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time. Will continue on CVVH until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Should still only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia.
   Patient likely has subacute DIC. Per Heme, blood bank has 1 U frozen
   for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - F/U Super Coombs test from Blood Bank.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin release assay for
   confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. **Pt needs separate order for
   platelet count daily.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban.
   PTT is < 60, but risks for bleeding in this pt if on Argatroban are
   substantial, and will thus wait for SRA result. Appreciate further heme
   recs.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for at least 4
   days. Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 60**] also be delirious
   at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above. Last transfusion 1U PRBCs [**4-18**].
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and ejection fraction of 30% who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been in the ICU for over a month and has developed various complications including C. difficile colitis, intra-abdominal fungal and gram-negative bacterial abscess, acute kidney injury, anemia, coagulopathy, and transaminitis. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension in the setting of septic shock may be due to several factors including pneumonia, cardiogenic component from ischemic heart disease, and possibly distributive shock. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and continue with gentle diuresis as tolerated.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA and requires mechanical ventilation. Pressure support trials should be continued as tolerated to wean off ventilatory support.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: Although the patient has been afebrile for five days, the recent increase in lactate levels suggests ongoing infection. Repeat blood cultures should be sent, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued.
4. Oliguric, acute on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires multiple vasopressors for blood pressure control. There is evidence of large bilateral pleural effusions with right lower lobe consolidation, suggesting pneumonia. The patient also has anasarca and decreased size of abdominal fluid collection. Renal recommendations include giving albumin with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) to maintain blood pressure stability. Additionally, the patient has a left arm swelling, but an ultrasound preliminary report indicates no deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Allergies include cholestyramine, niacin, iodine, ciprofloxacin, heparin agents, and muscle weakness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's current condition of septic shock can lead to complications such as organ dysfunction, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
2. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome: Due to sepsis and septic shock, the patient may develop multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, which can affect various organs including the kidneys, liver, heart, and lungs.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia in a patient on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory status and lead to further complications.
4. Renal Failure"

   24 Hour Events:
   *Hypotension:
   - Added back levophed for SBPs in 60s with elevated lactate, poor
   mental status.
   - Trial dobutamine for goal MAP 55, SBP 90 --> not much benefit; d/c'd
   and added vasopressin instead.
   - Was doing well on vasopressin only (levophed turned off), but BP
   decreased, thus levophed was re-added, initially at 0.3mcg/kg. Pt
   mentating fine.
   - ID Recs -> continue Fluc until yeast speciation returns. If
   deteriorates, switch to micafungin (has been switched; also gave
   one-time dose of IV vancomycin)
   - Per Surgery -> will need interval CTAbd in 2 wks.
   - CT Abd obtained to check for interval change in the abscess
   (Radiology not willing to do IV contrast due to no PIV)
 Prelim Read:
   Large b/l pleural effusions w/ RLL consolidation and air bronchograms

   anasarca.
   - Transfused 1U PRBCs overnight (started at midnight). ?leak during
   transfusion, may only have received

   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Levophed and midodrine weaned overnight and 1.5L removed w/
   CVVH yesterday, however lactate rose to 5.9 w/ decreasing mental
   status. Restarted levophed at 0.2mcg/kg this AM for SBPs in 60s.
   - Trial dobutamine for probable cardiogenic component to ongoing
   hypotension.
   - Will hold CVVH during dobutamine trial and plan to restart tonight.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 55, SPB 90.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trials yesterday but then
   required MMV for apnea and Assist Control after midnight.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.

   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH
   at this time, holding temporarily during dobutamine trial. Will
   continue on CVVH until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - On Neutra-phos per Renal
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Will not repeat Super Coombs per Heme. Should still only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient likely has subacute DIC.
   Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient.
   - Transfused 1U [**4-18**] with appropriate Hct bump from 19->25, but Hct down
   again today to 22.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Transfused 1U today and check post-transfusion Hct.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and HIT.
   Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the hospital stay.
   Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**]. Per heme, will check serotonin release assay for
   confirmation and monitor INR/PTT. **Pt needs separate order for
   platelet count daily.
   - F/U serotonin release assay. F/U daily coags.
   - Per Heme: If coags normalize (PTT <60), consider starting Argatroban.
   PTT is < 60, but risks for bleeding in this pt if on Argatroban are
   substantial, and will thus wait for SRA result. Appreciate further heme
   recs.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation for past 4
   days, unless more somnolent this AM off pressors. Frustrated with long
   ICU stay and illness. Will reassess mental status when back on pressors
   later today.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine/dobutamine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been in the ICU for several weeks. He has developed complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, coagulopathy, and dysphonia. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires ongoing pressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypotension despite receiving multiple vasopressors. This indicates ongoing septic shock and requires careful monitoring and adjustment of pressor therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA and is on mechanical ventilation. He is tolerating pressure support trials but may require tracheostomy and continued ventilatory support.
3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but there is concern for ongoing infection due to the presence of leukocytosis. Cultures should be monitored, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on the identified pathogens.
4. Oliguric, Acute on Chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient has acute kidney injury superimposed on chronic kidney disease. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) but may require a permanent dial"

   24 Hour Events:
   *Hypotension:
   - Added back levophed for SBPs in 60s with elevated lactate, poor
   mental status.
   - Trial dobutamine for goal MAP 55, SBP 90 --> not much benefit; d/c'd
   and added vasopressin instead.
   - Was doing well on vasopressin only (levophed turned off), but BP
   decreased, thus levophed was re-added, initially at 0.3mcg/kg. Pt
   mentating fine.
   - ID Recs -> continue Fluc until yeast speciation returns. If
   deteriorates, switch to micafungin (has been switched; also gave
   one-time dose of IV vancomycin)
   - Per Surgery -> will need interval CTAbd in 2 wks.
   - CT Abd obtained to check for interval change in the abscess
   (Radiology not willing to do IV contrast due to no PIV)
 Prelim Read:
   Large b/l pleural effusions w/ RLL consolidation and air bronchograms

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30% who presented with septic shock, multi-organ failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been in the ICU for several weeks and has developed complications including c. difficile colitis, intra-abdominal fungal/green-nosed bacterial abscess, acute kidney injury/uremia, anemia, coagulopathy, and left upper extremity swelling. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement followed by setbacks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient's shock status requires ongoing monitoring and management with pressors such as levophed/vasopressin. Close attention should be given to maintaining a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mmHg.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's ARDS secondary to PNA is a significant concern. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential. Pressure support trials should be attempted as tolerated to wean the patient off assist control mode.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: Despite the patient being afebrile for five days, there is a concern about leukocytosis. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

   Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia
   24 Hour Events:
   *Hypotension:
   - Added back levophed for SBPs in 60s with elevated lactate, poor
   mental status.
   - Trial dobutamine for goal MAP 55, SBP 90 --> not much benefit; d/c'd
   and added vasopressin instead.
   - Was doing well on vasopressin only (levophed turned off), but BP
   decreased, thus levophed was re-added, initially at 0.3mcg/kg. Pt
   mentating fine.
   - ID Recs -> continue Fluc until yeast speciation returns. If
   deteriorates, switch to micafungin (has been switched; also gave
   one-time dose of IV vancomycin)
   - Per Surgery -> will need interval CTAbd in 2 wks.
   - With decreasing mental status, CT Abd obtained to check for interval
   change in the abscess (Radiology not willing to do IV contrast due to
   no PIV)
 Prelim Read: Large b/l pleural effusions w/ RLL consolidation
   and air bronchograms suspic for PNA. Decreased size of abd fluid
   collection. Persistent anasarca.
   - Transfused 1U PRBCs overnight (started at midnight). ?leak during
   transfusion, may only have received

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/dobutamine yesterday for poor mentation, elevated
   lactate, but BP did not improve. Switched to levophed/vasopressin and
   able to wean levophed briefly, but then had to add back for precipitous
   BP drop. Did not receive CVVH. Lactate decreased , MvO2 Sat increased,
   and mental status improved today. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Attempt to wean levophed/vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 3hrs but back
   on Assist Control per remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled yesterday,
   repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**],
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave vanco IV x 1 given
   worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV contrast) prelim read
   shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Per ID, switch back to fluconazole as this is better coverage for
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**].
   - F/U sensitivities of c.[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**].
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.

   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension. CVVH held
   yesterday during multiple pressor trials. Phos elevated today. Will
   restart CVVH today and continue until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - d/c
d neutraphos for elevated phosphate.
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Will not repeat Super Coombs per Heme. Should still only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient likely has subacute DIC.
   Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient. Transfused 1 U
   overnight, but large quantity of blood leaked from line, may only have
   received
 unit. Post-transfusion Hct 23.7.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - sending new T&S to Red Cross today per Blood Bank in order to obtain
   more blood. Has 1U frozen in hospital.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. INR 3.5
   today. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Appreciate further heme recs, especially regarding HIT status given
   heparin Ab+ but SRA neg.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Left arm again swollen >> right arm
   overnight. U/S obtained, and again no DVT observed but asymmetric
   waveforms seen in L subclavian vein. Has symmetric strength/sensation
   in bilateral UE.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine/levo/vasopressin.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Agree with excellent MSIV note above.  Briefly, patient is a 82 yo M
   who presented with septic shock and has had a complicated ICU course.
   Mental status improved overnight with resumption of pressors to support
   BP.  Plans for today as follows:
   - resume CVVH
   - change micofungin back to fluconazole per ID recs
   - wean levophed as possible
   - discuss with IR if G-tube stoma fastener can be loosened
   - additional blood samples to be sent to blood bank for analysis
   - pressure support trial
   Of note after discussion with family this afternoon, patient is DNR
   (but not DNI as already trached).
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), C. difficile colitis, and an intra-abdominal fungal/green gram-negative bacterial abscess. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing hypotension requiring vasopressor support. He is also experiencing oliguric acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, transaminitis, dysphonia, and mental status changes. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery bypass graft surgery and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires continuous monitoring and adjustment of vasopressor therapy to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pneumonia. Pressure support trials may be attempted as tolerated.
3. Leukocytosis/Fever: Despite being afebrile for five days, the patient's lactate levels have doubled. Repeat blood cultures have been sent, and the patient is being treated for intra-abdominal abscess with fluconazole and micafungin.

   Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia
   24 Hour Events:
   *Hypotension:
   - Added back levophed for SBPs in 60s with elevated lactate, poor
   mental status.
   - Trial dobutamine for goal MAP 55, SBP 90 --> not much benefit; d/c'd
   and added vasopressin instead.
   - Was doing well on vasopressin only (levophed turned off), but BP
   decreased, thus levophed was re-added, initially at 0.3mcg/kg. Pt
   mentating fine.
   - ID Recs -> continue Fluc until yeast speciation returns. If
   deteriorates, switch to micafungin (has been switched; also gave
   one-time dose of IV vancomycin)
   - Per Surgery -> will need interval CTAbd in 2 wks.
   - With decreasing mental status, CT Abd obtained to check for interval
   change in the abscess (Radiology not willing to do IV contrast due to
   no PIV)
 Prelim Read: Large b/l pleural effusions w/ RLL consolidation
   and air bronchograms suspic for PNA. Decreased size of abd fluid
   collection. Persistent anasarca.
   - Transfused 1U PRBCs overnight (started at midnight). ?leak during
   transfusion, may only have received

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/dobutamine yesterday for poor mentation, elevated
   lactate, but BP did not improve. Switched to levophed/vasopressin and
   able to wean levophed briefly, but then had to add back for precipitous
   BP drop. Did not receive CVVH. Lactate decreased , MvO2 Sat increased,
   and mental status improved today. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Attempt to wean levophed/vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 3hrs but back
   on Assist Control per remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled yesterday,
   repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**],
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave vanco IV x 1 given
   worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV contrast) prelim read
   shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Per ID, switch back to fluconazole as this is better coverage for
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**].
   - F/U sensitivities of c.[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**].
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension. CVVH held
   yesterday during multiple pressor trials. Phos elevated today. Will
   restart CVVH today and continue until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - d/c
d neutraphos for elevated phosphate.
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Will not repeat Super Coombs per Heme. Should still only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient likely has subacute DIC.
   Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient. Transfused 1 U
   overnight, but large quantity of blood leaked from line, may only have
   received
 unit. Post-transfusion Hct 23.7.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - sending new T&S to Red Cross today per Blood Bank in order to obtain
   more blood. Has 1U frozen in hospital.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. INR 3.5
   today. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Appreciate further heme recs, especially regarding HIT status given
   heparin Ab+ but SRA neg.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Left arm again swollen >> right arm
   overnight. U/S obtained, and again no DVT observed but asymmetric
   waveforms seen in L subclavian vein. Has symmetric strength/sensation
   in bilateral UE.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine/levo/vasopressin.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been experiencing hypotension, requiring multiple pressor agents, and has had difficulty maintaining stable blood pressure. There have been attempts to wean off the pressors, but the patient's blood pressure remains unstable. The patient has also shown signs of respiratory failure, with ARDS secondary to PNA, and oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a severe and life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to an infection. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring ongoing pressor support.
2. Multi-Organ Dysfunction: The patient is experiencing multi-organ dysfunction, with involvement of the lungs, kidneys, and liver. This is indicated by the presence of ARDS, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, and elevated liver enzymes.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of consolidation and pleural effusions.
4. Abdominal Abscess: The patient had an abdominal abscess, which was drained on [**4-17**]. The abscess was caused by an intra-abdominal fungal/Gram-negative bacterial infection.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to shock liver, subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and poor nutrition. The patient's platelet count has been decreasing over time, and they have a positive result for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely due to chronic disease and ongoing hemolysis. The patient's reticulocyte count is appropriate, indicating that the bone marrow is responding to the anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has left upper extremity swelling, and an ultrasound has been done to rule out DVT. Asymmetric waveforms were observed in the left subclavian vein, which may indicate a possible DVT.
2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver dysfunction. This could be due to shock liver or other underlying causes.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has had fluctuating mental status, ranging from alert and oriented to drowsy and poorly responsive. This could be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other factors.
4. Dysphonia: The patient's voice has been affected by the cuffed tracheostomy tube. This may improve once the cuff size is adjusted or the tube is changed.
5. Tremor: The patient has developed a new resting and action tremor in both hands. This could be due to side effects of levophed, neuropathy, or hypocalcemia.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications related to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and VAP. Ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to address these complications and improve the patient's condition."

   2. Asymmetric waveforms demonstrated in the subclavian veins. ?? distal
   stenosis on the left.
   3. Left arm edema.
   Renal Ultrasound ([**4-23**]): No hydronephrosis. Multiple small right renal
   cysts.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Able to wean off all pressors overnight.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   - If pressors required, start with vasopressin first.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) prelim read shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Continue fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc [**2167-4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and
   will continue until off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and
   no evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g
   Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help with persistent anasarca.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Left arm again swollen >> right arm.
   Has symmetric strength/sensation in bilateral UE. No evidence DVT on
   U/S but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, vasopressin/levophed as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and multiorgan failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, anemia of chronic disease, coagulopathy, and dysphonia due to a cuffed tracheostomy tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock and required early goal-directed therapy. He has a cardiogenic component to shock due to ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient's blood pressure should be monitored and maintained with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 100 mmHg. If pressors are required, vasopressin should be started first.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to pneumonia and is currently on assist control ventilation. Pressure support trials should be continued as tolerated. The patient may require tracheostomy tube changes, and extubation should be considered when appropriate.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia. He also had an intra-ab"

   2. Asymmetric waveforms demonstrated in the subclavian veins. ?? distal
   stenosis on the left.
   3. Left arm edema.
   Renal Ultrasound ([**4-23**]): No hydronephrosis. Multiple small right renal
   cysts.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Able to wean off all pressors overnight.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100. If pressors
   required, start with vasopressin first.
   - Pt may also have blood loss contributing to hypotension. Will recheck
   PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue
   zyprexa 5mg daily, prn, for anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) prelim read shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abd abcess.
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - f/u further ID recs
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with persistent anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   - Recheck Albumin today.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened today.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Recheck PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved today. No evidence DVT on U/S
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Agree with excellent MSIV note.  Briefly, patient is a 81 yo M admitted
   with septic shock who has had a complicated and prolonged ICU course.
   Major issues continue to be
   - hemodynamics and fluid status with the patient intermittently
   requiring pressors to maintain perfusion, though off pressors
   currently.  Continuing CVVH with goal to remove excess volume as
   tolerated.  Plan to place HD line likely early next week.
   - infection
 cont. to have air & fluid in abdomen & pigtail drain
   continues to drain infection.  Continuing cefepime & fluconazole for
   intra-abdominal abscess per ID recs & PO vanc & IV flagyl for C. diff.
   - hct remains stable, though coagulation labs appear somewhat worse.
   Will cont. to follow.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with ischemic heart disease who was admitted with septic shock. The patient has had a complicated ICU course and currently has several ongoing issues:

1. Hemodynamics and fluid status: The patient intermittently requires pressors to maintain perfusion, but is currently off pressors. CVVH is being continued to remove excess volume as tolerated, and a plan is in place to place a hemodialysis line early next week.

2. Infection: The patient continues to have air & fluid in the abdomen, and a pigtail drain is in place to drain the infection. Cefepime and fluconazole are being continued for the intra-abdominal abscess per ID recs, and PO vancomycin and IV flagyl are being given for C. diff.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, and there has been limited benefit from iron supplementation. Folate levels are normal, B12 levels are high, and there is evidence of ongoing hemolysis. The patient tested positive for super Coombs but on repeat testing was negative. It is advised to only transfuse in emergency settings of active ischemia due to a history of delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has frozen one unit for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red Cross.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor nutrition. Plate"

   1. No son[**Name (NI) **] evidence for DVT of the left upper extremity.
   2. Asymmetric waveforms demonstrated in the subclavian veins. ?? distal
   stenosis on the left.
   3. Left arm edema.
   Renal Ultrasound ([**4-23**]): No hydronephrosis. Multiple small right renal
   cysts.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Able to wean off all pressors overnight.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100. If pressors
   required, start with vasopressin first.
   - Pt may also have blood loss contributing to hypotension. Will recheck
   PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue
   zyprexa 5mg daily, prn, for anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) prelim read shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abd abcess.
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - f/u further ID recs
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with persistent anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   - Recheck Albumin today.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened today.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Recheck PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved today. No evidence DVT on U/S
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, anxiety, impaired balance, muscle performance, transfers, ventilation, altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, and a previous diagnosis of C. difficile infection.

24-hour events include loosening of the G-tube at the site of skin breakdown, weaning off all pressors, and changes in medication and family history. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/53 to 141/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's renal function is being monitored through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results indicate coagulopathy, lactic acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening of tissue perfusion, further development of coagulopathy, potential relapse of C. difficile infection, progression of chronic heart failure, exacerbation of chronic renal failure, hemolytic anemia, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, muscle performance, transfers, ventilation, altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical assessment and investigations may be necessary to determine the exact medical complications that can arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Able to wean off all pressors overnight.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   - If pressors required, start with vasopressin first.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes

   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) prelim read shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Continue fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc [**2167-4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and
   will continue until off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and
   no evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g
   Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help with persistent anasarca.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Left arm again swollen >> right arm.
   Has symmetric strength/sensation in bilateral UE. No evidence DVT on
   U/S but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, vasopressin/levophed as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Able to wean off all pressors overnight.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   - If pressors required, start with vasopressin first.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to CAP PNA complicated by VAP. The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, intra-abdominal fungal/GNR abscess, and is currently on CVVH with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient's current infectious issues include C. diff colitis and intra-abdominal abscess. The patient has been weaned off all pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock and required early goal-directed therapy. There is a cardiogenic component to the shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient had a line pulled and was unable to obtain central pressure monitoring. They are now on midodrine TID and continue to monitor pressure with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 100. If pressors are required, they will start with vasopressin first.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA and is tracheostomized. They were on assist control ventilation but tolerated a pressure support trial for 5 hours yesterday. New BAL and sputum cultures are negative. They will continue pressure support trials as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/ ongoing
   pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C. diff colitis
   and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/dobutamine yesterday for poor mentation, elevated
   lactate, but BP did not improve. Switched to levophed/vasopressin and
   able to wean levophed briefly, but then had to add back for precipitous
   BP drop. Did not receive CVVH. Lactate decreased , MvO2 Sat increased,
   and mental status improved today. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Attempt to wean levophed/vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 3hrs but back
   on Assist Control per remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis/fever
 Pt afebrile x 5days. Lactate doubled yesterday,
   repeat BC sent. Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**],
   pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in place.
   Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to hemolyzed
   sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for intra-abdominal
   abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave vanco IV x 1 given
   worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV contrast) prelim read
   shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**])
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - Per ID, switch back to fluconazole as this is better coverage for
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**].
   - F/U sensitivities of c.[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**].
   - f/u ID recs
   - Had G-J tube placed w/ IR [**4-21**] for post-abscess tube feeds
   - f/u final read CT Abdomen.
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension. CVVH held
   yesterday during multiple pressor trials. Phos elevated today. Will
   restart CVVH today and continue until off pressors.
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   - d/c
d neutraphos for elevated phosphate.
   - Continue EPO
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Stool guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested
   super Coombs positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg.
   Will not repeat Super Coombs per Heme. Should still only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient likely has subacute DIC.
   Per Heme, blood bank has 2 U frozen for this patient. Transfused 1 U
   overnight, but large quantity of blood leaked from line, may only have
   received
 unit. Post-transfusion Hct 23.7.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - sending new T&S to Red Cross today per Blood Bank in order to obtain
   more blood. Has 1U frozen in hospital.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. INR 3.5
   today. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Appreciate further heme recs, especially regarding HIT status given
   heparin Ab+ but SRA neg.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Left arm again swollen >> right arm
   overnight. U/S obtained, and again no DVT observed but asymmetric
   waveforms seen in L subclavian vein. Has symmetric strength/sensation
   in bilateral UE.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine/levo/vasopressin.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, multiorgan failure, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and chronic anemia. He has multiple comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for severe pneumonia with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute kidney injury and is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for various infections, including MRSA and fungal/Gram-negative bacterial abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure and inadequate tissue perfusion. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's ARDS is secondary to severe pneumonia and is a critical complication that requires close monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can further worsen the respiratory status.
3. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/uremia: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to uremia and requiring ongoing management with dialysis.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, which is commonly seen in individuals with long-standing illnesses. It can be exacerbated by acute blood loss or ongoing hemolysis.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised due to liver dysfunction, subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and malnutrition. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Left upper extremity swelling: The patient's left arm swelling may indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or subclavian vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not treated promptly.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes are likely due to shock liver, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any progression or new causes of liver dysfunction.
8. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status fluctuates due to various factors including sepsis, sedation, and the ICU environment. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required to maintain his mental well-being.
9. CV/HF: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and ongoing monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
10. Tremor: The patient's new tremor could be a side effect of medications or a sign of hypocalcemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

Overall, the patient is facing multiple medical complications that require careful monitoring and management. The priority is to stabilize his hemodynamics, address the infections, and support organ functions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating blood pressures and lactate levels. Vasopressin was restarted due to increasing lactate and borderline blood pressures. Levophed was restarted for persistent mean arterial pressures in the 40s.

The patient developed epigastric pain around 5 am, and the gastrointestinal tube was draining clumpy, maroon fluid. Stool guaiac positive. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, alteration in tissue perfusion, coagulopathy, Clostridium difficile infection, chronic heart failure, hemolytic anemia, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines (dialysis catheter and PICC line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate order in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which indicates severe respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the need for"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue
   zyprexa 5mg daily, prn, for anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.

   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) prelim read shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abd abcess.
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - f/u further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge. Stool guaiac
   negative Pigtail output much clearer, green than previously. No nausea.
   LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday, Hct stable, amylase/lipase
   normal. Concern for cholangitis vs new ischemic injury to liver.
   - Consider repeat CT abdomen this AM.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with persistent anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   - Recheck Albumin today.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened today.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Recheck PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved today. No evidence DVT on U/S
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure, and multiorgan failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for several weeks and has multiple medical complications, including leukocytosis, abdominal pain, anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, transaminitis, dysphonia, mental status changes, cardiovascular instability, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. There is a cardiogenic component to the shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease. The patient requires ongoing pressor support and careful monitoring of blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient developed ARDS secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode. The patient tolerated a pressure support trial but was placed back on assist-control mode for the remainder of the day. A possible evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia was noted on a recent CT scan.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has an intra-abdominal abscess that is sensitive to fluconazole and vancomycin. The patient's leukocyte"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - f/u further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will reconsider repeating CT
   today.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Concern for gastric ulcer,
   cholangitis vs new ischemic injury to liver.
   - Consider repeat CT abdomen this AM.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with persistent anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit. Albumin [**4-24**]
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   - Recheck Albumin today.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened today.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Recheck PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved today. No evidence DVT on U/S
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Tolerated PS trial yesterday x 5hrs but back
   on Assist Control for remainder of day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT
   [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover GNR infection that he previously
   had. New BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes
   fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue
   zyprexa 5mg daily, prn, for anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) prelim read shows no interval worsening of abscess.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abd abcess.
   - On PO vanc  and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C.
   diff when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - f/u further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Will consider repeat CT on Monday, [**4-27**] to look for
   interval change.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge. Stool guaiac
   negative Pigtail output much clearer, green than previously. No nausea.
   LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday, Hct stable, amylase/lipase
   normal. Concern for cholangitis vs new ischemic injury to liver.
   - Consider repeat CT abdomen this AM.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with persistent anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   - Recheck Albumin today.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened today.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool (neg
   thus far); f/u further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   - Recheck PM Hct and transfuse prn.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved today. No evidence DVT on U/S
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. Stable. Will recheck LFTs today given elevated Alk Phos and
   TBili.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure, and multiorgan failure. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and intra-abdominal fungal and Gram-negative bacterial abscesses. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and intermittent pressor support. He has been experiencing abdominal pain, which could be due to cholangitis or a new ischemic injury to the liver. The patient also has anemia of chronic disease, low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and a positive super Coombs test. He is HIT positive but SRA negative. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Shock/hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. There is a cardiogenic component to the shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease. The patient continues to require pressor support, and efforts are being made to wean the pressors as tolerated.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to pneumonia. He is on ventilatory support and has been tracheostomized. Pressure support trials are being attempted as tolerated.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsi"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a low ejection fraction (EF 30%), who was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has required intermittent use of vasopressors due to persistent hypotension. He also has acute renal failure and anemia of chronic disease with ongoing hemolysis and evidence of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to his history of ischemic heart disease and reduced EF.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient developed ARDS secondary to pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There may be a need for tracheostomy and weaning off ventilatory support.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count initially, indicating an infection. He has completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, there is still a concern for intra-abdominal abscess, for which he is receiving fluconazole and micafungin.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient recently developed new abdominal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Some of the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is currently in septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection that occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has impaired kidney function, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). This can lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a disorder of blood clotting. This can increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has symptoms consistent with CDI, including diarrhea and positive stool guaiac test. CDI is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis.

6. Chronic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which may contribute to fluid retention and respiratory compromise.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has decreased mobility and pressure ulcers, indicating impaired skin integrity.

8. Anemia and hemolysis: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis vs new ischemic injury to liver.
   Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with persistent anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit. Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).

   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. Early Goal Directed Therapy was initiated, and the Apache IV score was 114. Possible sources for sepsis include PNA, C. diff, and intra-abdominal abscess.
- The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA and is on ventilatory support. There is evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on CT scan.
- The patient completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. An intra-abdominal abscess was drained on 4/17, and the patient started fluconazole on 4/16. The abscess culture was negative for galactomannan but positive for [Last Name (un)]. The patient switched from fluc to micafungin on 4/22 and received vancomycin IV once due to worsening clinical status. A CT abdomen showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to the duodenum.
- The patient developed new abdominal pain this morning, with gastric contents changing from bilious to maroon sludge, gastrocult positive. Stool guaiac was negative. Pigtail output was clearer, green than previously"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and an ejection fraction of 30%.
- He was admitted with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
- He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and an intra-abdominal fungal/gamma-negative rod (GNR) abscess.
- The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, requiring multiple vasopressors.
- His respiratory status has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has experienced episodes of oliguria and anemia of chronic disease with ongoing hemolysis.
- He has a coagulopathy likely due to shock liver, subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and poor nutrition.
- The patient has edema and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- He has dysphonia due to a cuffed tracheostomy tube.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated but is currently alert and oriented.
- His cardiovascular status is stable, but he has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous percutaneous coronary"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, and severe shock. He has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. The patient also has an abdominal abscess with gram-negative and fungal infection, and is undergoing continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure.

24-Hour Events:
- The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing septic shock requiring vasopressin and norepinephrine infusion.
- Respiratory support has been maintained with tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
- Fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing attempts to remove excess fluid.
- The patient has developed new abdominal tenderness, which may be due to cholangitis, peritonitis from an abscess, or hepatic abscess. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is planned to further evaluate this.
- Renal failure continues, and the patient remains on CVVH.
- Anemia is present, with positive Coombs test, making transfusion challenging.
- The patient has tested positive for PF4 antibodies but negative for serotonin release assay.

Laboratory Results:
- Blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Electrolyte levels are within normal range"

His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/70 mmHg to 200/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and ABG results of ///22/. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, platelet count, and albumin levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant changes. Imaging studies reveal a phlegmon in the duodenum and hypodense loci in the liver and spleen, suggestive of abscesses or infarcts. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including cholestyramine, niacin, heparin agents, ciprofloxacin, and muscle weakness. The patient"

   Prelim:
   Pigtail in place with residual phlegmon, slightly smaller. Small liver
   lesions
   suspicious for abscesses, and splenic lesions, infarcts vs. abscesses,
   but no
   drainable collection.
   KUB [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   Supine and left lateral decubitus views. Positioning is suboptimal.
   Diaphragm
   is not entirely included. Comparison is made to the previous study of
   [**2167-4-9**]. The balloon tip of a gastrostomy tube is no longer clearly
   identified. One radiopaque catheter, presumably the patient's
   gastrostomy,
   terminates in the left upper quadrant. A second radiopaque catheter of
   smaller diameter terminates in the mid abdomen to the right of midline.
   Numerous surgical clips are again demonstrated in the right upper
   quadrant.
   There is some motion artifact. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
   No
   free air is identified. Degenerative changes are again noted in the
   lower
   lumbar spine.
   CXR [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   CHEST, AP SUPINE: The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary
   artery
   bypass surgery. A pacemaker ICD device again has leads terminating in
   the
   right atrium and ventricle, respectively. A tracheostomy tube is in a
   similar
   position. The aortic arch is calcified. The cardiac and mediastinal
   contours
   are unchanged. Volume loss and left retrocardiac opacity has improved
   somewhat.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]
 was switched to micafungin then back to fluconazole when
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] came back sensitive to fluc) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a recent hospitalization for septic shock and multiorgan failure. He currently presents with abdominal pain, oliguric renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy, and left upper extremity swelling. The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, intra-abdominal fungal/GNR abscess, and has undergone multiple interventions including tracheostomy, coronary artery bypass surgery, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors including sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, and various comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock and continues to require intermittent pressor support. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS secondary to pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on the CT scan.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient presents with new-onset abdominal pain, which is concerning for gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, or ischemic injury to the liver. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely secondary to infection and inflammation"

   CT abdomen/pelvis [**2167-4-25**]
   Prelim:
   Pigtail in place with residual phlegmon, slightly smaller. Small liver
   lesions
   suspicious for abscesses, and splenic lesions, infarcts vs. abscesses,
   but no
   drainable collection.
   KUB [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   Supine and left lateral decubitus views. Positioning is suboptimal.
   Diaphragm
   is not entirely included. Comparison is made to the previous study of
   [**2167-4-9**]. The balloon tip of a gastrostomy tube is no longer clearly
   identified. One radiopaque catheter, presumably the patient's
   gastrostomy,
   terminates in the left upper quadrant. A second radiopaque catheter of
   smaller diameter terminates in the mid abdomen to the right of midline.
   Numerous surgical clips are again demonstrated in the right upper
   quadrant.
   There is some motion artifact. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
   No
   free air is identified. Degenerative changes are again noted in the
   lower
   lumbar spine.
   CXR [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   CHEST, AP SUPINE: The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary
   artery
   bypass surgery. A pacemaker ICD device again has leads terminating in
   the
   right atrium and ventricle, respectively. A tracheostomy tube is in a
   similar
   position. The aortic arch is calcified. The cardiac and mediastinal
   contours
   are unchanged. Volume loss and left retrocardiac opacity has improved
   somewhat.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient's infectious issues include Clostridium difficile colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/green necrotic abscess. 

The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, oliguric acute on chronic acute renal failure/uremia, anemia of chronic disease with evidence of ongoing hemolysis, low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and coagulopathy likely due to shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor nutrition. The patient also has left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia due to cuffed tracheostomy, and mental status changes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rhonchi throughout bilateral lower lung fields, tenderness and guarding in the epigastric and right upper quadrant, and large stage 1-2 pressure ulcer on the back of the head.

   CT abdomen/pelvis [**2167-4-25**]
   Prelim:
   Pigtail in place with residual phlegmon, slightly smaller. Small liver
   lesions
   suspicious for abscesses, and splenic lesions, infarcts vs. abscesses,
   but no
   drainable collection.
   KUB [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   Supine and left lateral decubitus views. Positioning is suboptimal.
   Diaphragm
   is not entirely included. Comparison is made to the previous study of
   [**2167-4-9**]. The balloon tip of a gastrostomy tube is no longer clearly
   identified. One radiopaque catheter, presumably the patient's
   gastrostomy,
   terminates in the left upper quadrant. A second radiopaque catheter of
   smaller diameter terminates in the mid abdomen to the right of midline.
   Numerous surgical clips are again demonstrated in the right upper
   quadrant.
   There is some motion artifact. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
   No
   free air is identified. Degenerative changes are again noted in the
   lower
   lumbar spine.
   CXR [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   CHEST, AP SUPINE: The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary
   artery
   bypass surgery. A pacemaker ICD device again has leads terminating in
   the
   right atrium and ventricle, respectively. A tracheostomy tube is in a
   similar
   position. The aortic arch is calcified. The cardiac and mediastinal
   contours
   are unchanged. Volume loss and left retrocardiac opacity has improved
   somewhat.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and a recent hospitalization for septic shock and multiorgan failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to ARDS secondary to pneumonia. The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including leukocytosis, abdominal pain, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive in the setting of septic shock and requires pressor support. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to his ischemic heart disease, but the patient's mental status and lactate levels have improved with the use of vasopressin and levophed.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation. He has tolerated pressure support trials but requires ongoing ventilatory support.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia. He now has an intra-abdominal fungal/GNR abscess and is being treated with fluconazole and micafungin.

4. Abdominal Pain: The patient presents with new abdominal pain, which has changed from bilious to maroon sludge. There are"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. On levophed/vasopressin yesterday w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID. Tolerated several
   hours off pressors yesterday, but vasopressin and levophed had to be
   added back.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 100.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure. The patient has been diagnosed with CAP (community-acquired pneumonia), complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), C. difficile colitis, and intra-abdominal fungal/green nail bacteria (GNR) abscess. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient's current medical issues include shock/hypotension, respiratory failure/ARDS, leukocytosis, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia, mental status changes, cardiovascular stability, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock and required early goal-directed therapy. The patient's cardiogenic component to shock may be related to ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. Pressor support has been required, and attempts to wean off pressors have been made with the goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 100.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient developed ARDS secondary to pneumonia and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient"

   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen on [**4-22**] CT
   Abdomen, most likely due to septic infarcts vs. ischemia. No drainable
   fluid noted. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize. Given abdominal pain today, will repeat CT Abdomen today
   to look for interval change in these lesions.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**11-21**] abdominal pain this morning.
   Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult
   positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green
   than previously. No nausea. LFTS elevated but stable from yesterday,
   Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases
   earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for
   gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new
   ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - Obtain KUB.
   - Repeat CT abdomen this AM with PO/IV contrast. Will need PIV placed
   today for IV contrast.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and will continue until
   off pressors. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin [**Hospital1 **] to help
   with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of clinical
   benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today. Albumin [**4-24**]
   1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH with I/O even today give decreased edema and
   hypotension.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has C. diff colitis and an intra-abdominal fungal/gamma-negatives (GNR) abscess. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement.

Assessment and plan:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. Early goal-directed therapy was initiated with an Apache IV score of 114. The sources of sepsis are likely to be PNA, C. diff, and intra-abdominal abscess. There is also a cardiogenic component to the shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient had an arterial line pulled on [**4-19**], and central pressure monitoring is not available. The patient is on levophed/vasopressin and has shown improved mental status and decreased lactate. Pressors should be weaned as tolerated, with the goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 100 mmHg.

2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS"

   Prelim:
   Pigtail in place with residual phlegmon, slightly smaller. Small liver
   lesions
   suspicious for abscesses, and splenic lesions, infarcts vs. abscesses,
   but no
   drainable collection.
   KUB [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   Supine and left lateral decubitus views. Positioning is suboptimal.
   Diaphragm
   is not entirely included. Comparison is made to the previous study of
   [**2167-4-9**]. The balloon tip of a gastrostomy tube is no longer clearly
   identified. One radiopaque catheter, presumably the patient's
   gastrostomy,
   terminates in the left upper quadrant. A second radiopaque catheter of
   smaller diameter terminates in the mid abdomen to the right of midline.
   Numerous surgical clips are again demonstrated in the right upper
   quadrant.
   There is some motion artifact. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
   No
   free air is identified. Degenerative changes are again noted in the
   lower
   lumbar spine.
   CXR [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   CHEST, AP SUPINE: The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary
   artery
   bypass surgery. A pacemaker ICD device again has leads terminating in
   the
   right atrium and ventricle, respectively. A tracheostomy tube is in a
   similar
   position. The aortic arch is calcified. The cardiac and mediastinal
   contours
   are unchanged. Volume loss and left retrocardiac opacity has improved
   somewhat.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90. Check
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain since
   yesterday morning. Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon
   sludge, gastro-occult positive. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output
   much clearer, green than previously. No nausea. LFTs stable.  Hct
   stable, amylase/lipase normal. Has had elevated transaminases earlier
   in hospital course likely due to shock liver. New concern for gastric
   ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new ischemic
   injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - KUB showing no free air
   - Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis yesterday showing no significant change per
   conversation. f/u final read
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]
 was switched to micafungin then back to fluconazole when
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] came back sensitive to fluc) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Suspicious for
   fungal seeding since they tend to be small and multifocal. Not
   drainable due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to
   pacemaker to further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.

   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs; ok to have CVVH holiday
   today to allow pt to sit in chair and move around a bit. Can give
   intermittent HD a try with pressors.
   - Continue EPO
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed several complications, including abdominal pain, leukocytosis, oliguric acute on chronic acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia, mental status changes, and tremors.

The patient's abdominal pain is a new concern since yesterday morning. The gastric contents have changed from bilious to maroon sludge, and there is a positive guaiac test. The pigtail output is much clearer, green than previously. No nausea is present, and the liver function tests (LFTs) are stable. However, there are elevated transaminases earlier in the hospital course, likely due to shock liver. The concern now is for gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, or new ischemic injury to the liver.

The patient has completed 11 days of meropenem for pan-sensitive Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). An intra-abdominal abscess is growing Candida albicans sensitive to fluconazole, which was started on day 1. The CT abdomen without IV contrast on day 22 showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent"

   Pigtail in place with residual phlegmon, slightly smaller. Small liver
   lesions
   suspicious for abscesses, and splenic lesions, infarcts vs. abscesses,
   but no
   drainable collection.
   KUB [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   Supine and left lateral decubitus views. Positioning is suboptimal.
   Diaphragm
   is not entirely included. Comparison is made to the previous study of
   [**2167-4-9**]. The balloon tip of a gastrostomy tube is no longer clearly
   identified. One radiopaque catheter, presumably the patient's
   gastrostomy,
   terminates in the left upper quadrant. A second radiopaque catheter of
   smaller diameter terminates in the mid abdomen to the right of midline.
   Numerous surgical clips are again demonstrated in the right upper
   quadrant.
   There is some motion artifact. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
   No
   free air is identified. Degenerative changes are again noted in the
   lower
   lumbar spine.
   CXR [**2167-4-25**]
   Final:
   CHEST, AP SUPINE: The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary
   artery
   bypass surgery. A pacemaker ICD device again has leads terminating in
   the
   right atrium and ventricle, respectively. A tracheostomy tube is in a
   similar
   position. The aortic arch is calcified. The cardiac and mediastinal
   contours
   are unchanged. Volume loss and left retrocardiac opacity has improved
   somewhat.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain since
   yesterday morning. Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon
   sludge, gastro-occult positive yesterday. Stool guaiac negative.
   Pigtail output much clearer, green than previously. No nausea. LFTS
   elevated but stable from yesterday, Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal.
   Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to
   shock liver. New concern for gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis
   +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn
   for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - KUB- no free air
   - CT abd/pelvis
 no significant change per conversation with
   radiology. F/u final read
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]
 was switched to micafungin then back to fluconazole when
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] came back sensitive to fluc) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH until afternoon and plan to take volume out as much as
   tolerated, then CVVH holiday for the rest of the day to allow patient
   to sit up and move around a bit. Plan on intermittent HD starting
   tomorrow.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to pneumonia (PNA) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), multiorgan failure, and abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, intra-abdominal fungal/gamma-negatives (GNR) abscess, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) with intermittent pressor requirement. 

Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. He had early goal-directed therapy and is now on levophed/vasopressin with improved mental status and decreased lactate. The plan is to wean off the pressors as tolerated, with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mmHg.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA. He is tracheostomized and on ventilatory support with assist-control mode. Possible evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on CT scan is being monitored, and the patient is receiving cefepime coverage for GNR infection.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing new abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Abdominal pain:  may be due to small abscesses in liver and spleen, as
   main abscess is actually getting better.  In setting of increased LFTs
   and possibly worsening abscesses, will
   ask ID if change should be made to caspofungin.  Will recheck blood cx.
   ?Candidemia - given asbcesses
   Respiratory failure:  was on PSV trial yesterday and did not fair
   well.  Will try again today.
   Renal failure/CVVH:  Might try off CVVH and see if he tolerates
   intermittent HD.
   Pressor requirement:  still requiring pressors, ?maybe able to come off
   if off CVVH

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.

 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain since
   yesterday morning. Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon
   sludge, gastro-occult positive yesterday. Stool guaiac negative.
   Pigtail output much clearer, green than previously. No nausea. LFTS
   elevated but stable from yesterday, Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal.
   Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to
   shock liver. New concern for gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis
   +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn
   for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - KUB- no free air
   - CT abd/pelvis
 no significant change per conversation with
   radiology. F/u final read
   - Surgery consult as needed.

   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-16**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-19**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-22**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2167-4-20**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2167-4-16**]
 was switched to micafungin then back to fluconazole when
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] came back sensitive to fluc) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH until afternoon and plan to take volume out as much as
   tolerated, then CVVH holiday for the rest of the day to allow patient
   to sit up and move around a bit. Plan on intermittent HD starting
   tomorrow.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-27**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multi-organ failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirements. The patient's current infectious issues include Clostridium difficile colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/green-nonspecific bacteria abscess.

The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. Early Goal Directed Therapy was initiated with an Apache IV score of 114. The patient's pneumonia, C. diff, and intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis. There is also a cardiogenic component to the patient's shock, as the patient has ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%.

The patient is tracheostomized and has been on mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode. The patient has tolerated pressure support trials for short periods. There is evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on chest imaging.

The patient has abdominal pain since yesterday morning, with gastric contents changing from bilious to maroon sludge, and positive guaiac test. The patient's pigtail output is clearer, indicating a possible improvement in the intra-abdominal abscess. No nausea is present, and the patient's liver function tests have stabilized. Amyl"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock and multiorgan failure. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of septic shock. The likely sources of sepsis include pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, and intra-abdominal fungal/green non-reflecting bacilli (GNR) abscess. The patient has a cardiogenic component to shock due to ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%. 

2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to PNA. He is intubated and on assisted control ventilation (ACV). The possibility of right lower lobe pneumonia is present. The patient is being treated with cefepime, which covers GNR infections. New balloon and sputum cultures are negative, but will be reevaluated if spikes fever occurs. 

3. Abdominal pain: The patient has new abdominal pain since yesterday morning. Gastric contents have changed from bilious to maroon sludge, and the patient has gastro-occult positive results yesterday. Stool guaiac is negative. The pigtail output is clearer, indicating a possible improvement in the intra-abdominal abscess."

   Imaging:
   CTAbdomen/Pelvis ([**4-25**]):
   1. Residual paraduodenal phlegmon with a pigtail in place.
   2. Multiple hypodense areas in the liver and spleen. The liver findings
   are
   again worrisome for small abscesses, although there is no definite
   change and
   no drainable collection. Differential considerations for the splenic
   lesions
   again include abscesses, infarcts or both.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult positive.
   Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing and decreased in volume.
   Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS trending down. Has had elevated
   transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver.
   Pain DDx included gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/-
   perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver.  Pain resolved
   w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller abd abscess, persistent
   hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs. infarct. Pt
   c/o [**3-24**] abd
cramps
 today in same location.
   - restarted tube feeds at 10cc/hr [**4-26**], now advanced to 30cc/hr.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], Cefepime [**4-19**]-  (Serratia, Klebsiella and
   Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in peritoneum -
   duration 14 days)
      #. [**Month/Day (4) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO.
   - Continue CVVH w/ goal -50cc/hour. Consider starting intermittent HD
   if BP tolerates, per renal recs.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD this week.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of ischemic heart disease, ejection fraction 30%, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient has several ongoing health issues that require attention:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. Early goal-directed therapy was administered, and Apache IV score was 114. Pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, and intra-abdominal abscess are potential sources of sepsis. Additionally, the patient has cardiogenic components to shock due to ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient had an arterial line pulled and is unable to obtain central pressure monitoring; however, thigh cuff measurements are being used. The plan is to attempt weaning off pressors as tolerated, with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mmHg, and clear mentation. Levophed and vasopressin are being continued.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to pneumonia. He is tracheostomized and on assist-control ventilation. He has tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) for a few hours"

   Imaging:
   CTAbdomen/Pelvis ([**4-25**]):
   1. Residual paraduodenal phlegmon with a pigtail in place.
   2. Multiple hypodense areas in the liver and spleen. The liver findings
   are
   again worrisome for small abscesses, although there is no definite
   change and
   no drainable collection. Differential considerations for the splenic
   lesions
   again include abscesses, infarcts or both.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].
   Currently in paced rhythm at HR77. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are
   unable to obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but
   insure if cuff BP measurements are accurate. Continues on
   levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status and decrease in lactate.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Consult EP to increased paced HR to 90. Consider Digoxin to improve
   systolic function.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety. Likely also has element of deconditioning and muscle weakness.
   - Will trial PSV, when/if pt becomes dyspneic/tachypneic, will check
   VBG. If hypercarbic, deconditioning will be more likely than anxiety.
   If hypocarbic, anxiety likely playing greater role in respiratory
   distress.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult positive.
   Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing and decreased in volume.
   Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS trending down. Has had elevated
   transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver.
   Pain DDx included gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/-
   perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver.  Pain resolved
   w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller abd abscess, persistent
   hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs. infarct. Pt
   c/o [**3-24**] abd
cramps
 today in same location.
   - restarted tube feeds at 10cc/hr [**4-26**], now advanced to 30cc/hr.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], Cefepime [**4-19**]-  (Serratia, Klebsiella and
   Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in peritoneum -
   duration 14 days)
      #. [**Month/Day (4) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - obtain TTE to look for source of septic infarcts in liver/spleen.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO.
   - Will trial intermittent HD if BP tolerates, per renal recs today.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD this week. Will d/w Renal.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multiorgan failure from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient's current issues include:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension due to septic shock. Early goal-directed therapy was initiated, and Apache IV score was 114. The patient's primary sources of sepsis are likely PNA, C. diff colitis, and intra-abdominal fungal/green abscess. Additionally, there is a cardiogenic component to the shock due to ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20-30%.

2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient developed ARDS secondary to PNA. He is tracheostomized and on assist-control ventilation. He has tolerated a few hours of pressure support each day. There is evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on CT scan. The patient is being treated with cefepime, which should cover GNR infection previously encountered. New bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum cultures are negative. If the patient experiences spikes in fever, new BAL and sputum cultures will be obtained. Zyprexa 5mg is being given for anxiety.

   Imaging:
   CTAbdomen/Pelvis ([**4-25**]):
   1. Residual paraduodenal phlegmon with a pigtail in place.
   2. Multiple hypodense areas in the liver and spleen. The liver findings
   are
   again worrisome for small abscesses, although there is no definite
   change and
   no drainable collection. Differential considerations for the splenic
   lesions
   again include abscesses, infarcts or both.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-18**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-21**].
   Currently in paced rhythm at HR77. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are
   unable to obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but
   insure if cuff BP measurements are accurate. Continues on
   levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status and decrease in lactate.
   Continues on Midodrine TID.
   - Consult EP to increase paced HR to 90. Consider Digoxin to improve
   systolic function.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety. Likely also has element of deconditioning and muscle weakness.
   - Will trial PSV, when/if pt becomes dyspneic/tachypneic, will check
   VBG. If hypercarbic, deconditioning will be more likely than anxiety.
   If hypocarbic, anxiety likely playing greater role in respiratory
   distress.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult positive.
   Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing and decreased in volume.
   Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS trending down. Has had elevated
   transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to shock liver.
   Pain DDx included gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis +/-
   perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver.  Pain resolved
   w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller abd abscess, persistent
   hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs. infarct. Pt
   c/o [**3-24**] abd
cramps
 today in same location.
   - restarted tube feeds at 10cc/hr [**4-26**], now advanced to 30cc/hr.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], Cefepime [**4-19**]-  (Serratia, Klebsiella and
   Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in peritoneum -
   duration 14 days)
      #. [**Month/Day (4) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - obtain TTE to look for source of septic infarcts in liver/spleen.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO.
   - Will trial intermittent HD if BP tolerates, per renal recs today.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD this week. Will d/w Renal.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Agree with excellent MSIV note above.  Patient is a 82 yo M admitted
   with sepsis, has had a complicated ICU course.  Continues to require
   pressors to maintain BP.  Will trial HD today.  Per family, they would
   like to see how pt. tolerates HD and are moving toward no further
   CVVH.  Continues to require ventilator assistance
 likely a mix of
   deconditioning and volume overload.  Will cont. to try to wean from
   vent.  Will also check TTE to assess for ? endocarditis given new
   hypoattenuating lesions in liver which could represent septic emboli.
   Patient
s hct continues to trend downward.  Will transfuse for HCT  <
   21.  Appreciate assistance from renal, ID, & heme consultants.
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who was admitted with sepsis secondary to pneumonia and multiorgan failure. He has had a complicated ICU course, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. The patient's current medical issues include shock/hypotension, respiratory failure/ARDS, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia, mental status changes, cardiovascular stability, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/hypotension: The patient requires ongoing vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to ischemic heart disease.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk of further lung injury and potential need for tracheostomy.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved post-fentanyl administration. However, there is a concern for gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis, and ischemic injury to the liver. Further evaluation and management are needed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has been treated for Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia and intra-abdominal abscess."

   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**4-1**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge, gastro-occult positive.
   Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output much clearer, green than
   previously. Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS trending down. Has
   had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to
   shock liver.  Pain DDx included gastric ulcer, cholangitis,
   diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver.  Pain
   resolved w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. Pain improved today.
   - restarted tube feeds at 10cc/hr [**4-26**].
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], Cefepime [**4-19**]-  (Serratia, Klebsiella and
   Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in peritoneum -
   duration 14 days)
      #. [**Month/Day (4) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-24**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO.
   - Continue CVVH w/ goal -50cc/hour. Consider starting intermittent HD
   if BP tolerates, per renal recs.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD this week.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male admit with sepsis initially and now s/p trach/PEG wtih
   intra-abdominal collection with both bacterial and fungal organisms in
   collection with pressors required for BP support.  This is in the
   setting of persistent renal failure and need for dialysis.  He does
   have some persistent hypotension which is of concern
this may well
   represent persistent compromise following sepsis.
   1)Sepsis
Patient has continued reasonable mental status at this time.
   Primary cause for hypotension is persistent infection combined with
   compromised cardiac function.  Will look to continued maintenance of
   adequate stroke volume to assure continued adequate perfusion.
   -Vanco po
C. Diff colitis
   -Leophed/Vasopressin/Midodrine
   -Flagyl/cefepime/Fluconazole
   -ECHO to look for possible vegetation
   -Concern for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] persisting with abscess formation as possible
   continued source.
   -Paced rhythm is maintained at 75
will need increased inotropy to aid
   in stabilization of BP
   2)Respiratory Failure
Maintained on A/C
will move to PSV trials as
   possible
current limiting factors are pneumonia
which appears to be
   improved based on sputum production, has persistent volume overload,
   the active question is in relation to evidence of persistent weakness
   limiting capacity to maintain effective tidal volume vs. anxiety.
   -PSV trial today
   -ABG at time of faiure
   -With compliance >30 would not expect mechanical disadvantage to make
   liberation from mechanical ventilation not possible.
   -OOB to chair today
   -Goal PSV trial of 2 hours today and possibly repeat
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Persistent
   -HD today
   -No evidence of continued expectation for improvement
will need tunnel
   line when infection risk has been minimized and will trial HD today
   -Continued anuria

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient also has intra-abdominal collections with bacterial and fungal organisms, persistent renal failure requiring dialysis, and compromised cardiac function.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient continues to have hypotension, which may represent persistent compromise following sepsis. The primary cause for hypotension is persistent infection combined with compromised cardiac function. The patient will need continued maintenance of adequate stroke volume to assure continued adequate perfusion.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is maintained on assisted mechanical ventilation (A/C) due to respiratory failure. The current limiting factors are pneumonia, which appears to be improved, persistent volume overload, and evidence of persistent weakness limiting capacity to maintain effective tidal volume vs. anxiety. The goal is to initiate a spontaneous breathing trial (PSV) today and possibly repeat it.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has persistent renal failure, and dialysis is required. There is no evidence of continued expectation for improvement. The plan is to trial hemodialysis (HD) today, and a tunnel line will be considered when the infection risk has been minimized.

In summary, the patient's main concerns include sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. His heart rate is being paced at 90 beats per minute. The patient has undergone several interventions, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics due to ongoing hypotension and new liver/spleen abscesses. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and elevated creatinine levels. His white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection. The patient also has a history of chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is at risk for complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy indicate a chronic respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest a coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding or clot formation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, hypotension, and presence of liver/spleen abscesses indicate an ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's decreased GFR and elevated creatinine levels suggest chronic renal failure, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased tissue perfusion increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and coagulopathy can increase the risk of DVT formation.
7. Stress Ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids can predispose him to stress ulcers.
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
9. Anxiety: The patient's altered mental status and critical illness may contribute to feelings of anxiety.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutritional status due to decreased oral intake and potential use of enteral feeding may lead to malnutrition.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms to promptly identify and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   Likely there is also cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic
   heart disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to
   obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin
   for most of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced
   rhythm to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday and able to wean levophed overnight. Pt may
   require intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Consider Digoxin to improve systolic function.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. VBG at end of PS trial yesterday
   indicates that patient not dramatically fatigued. Per RT, patient was
   empirically switched back to A/C to prevent tiring overnight. Pt also
   has bilateral large pleural effusions which may require therapeutic tap
   to improve respiratory status.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials x6-8hrs daily as tolerated, with
   close VBG monitoring. Continue A/C overnight.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge on [**4-25**], gastro-occult
   positive, now bilious. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing
   and decreased in volume. Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS
   trending down. Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital
   course likely due to shock liver.  Pain DDx included gastric ulcer,
   cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to
   liver.  Pain resolved w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller
   abd abscess, persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w
   abscess vs. infarct. Pt c/o persisent [**3-24**] abd
cramps
   - Pain largely resolved. Continue to monitor.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.

   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - F/U further heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stools
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but holding heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.

   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock and multiorgan failure. The patient has been treated for various infections, including C. difficile colitis and an intra-abdominal fungal/green abscess. He has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and requires intermittent pressors for blood pressure management. The patient also has a tracheostomy, is on mechanical ventilation, and has been undergoing dialysis due to acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient continues to require intermittent pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension. The source of sepsis is likely the PNA, C. difficile, and intra-abdominal abscesses. There may also be a cardiogenic component to shock due to the patient's ischemic heart disease.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He is now on assist-control ventilation with pressure support. The patient's tolerance for pressure support is increasing, but he still requires overnight assist-control ventilation to prevent tiring.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient presented with new abdominal pain on 04/25, which resolved with fentanyl. The pain differential diagnosis included gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis/perforation, and ischemic injury to the liver. The CT abdomen showed a smaller abdominal abscess and persistent hypodensities in the liver/spleen.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has been treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP, as well as intra-abdominal abscesses. He is currently being treated for C. difficile colitis. The CT abdomen showed a smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to the duodenum, and there are persistent hypodensities in the liver/spleen.
5. Oliguric, Acute on Chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient is in ARF from ATN in the setting of hypotension. He was on CVVH but is now on HD/UF to remove 2L fluid. Renal dosing medications will be continued, and EPO will be given.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease with limited benefit from iron supplementation. Folate levels are normal, and there is evidence of ongoing hemolysis. The patient tested positive for super Coombs but was negative on repeat testing. Blood products should be transfused only in emergency settings of active ischemia.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has likely subacute DIC and poor nutrition contributing to his coagulopathy. Platelets have been gradually decreasing, and the patient is HIT+. Daily coagulation studies will be monitored, and INR will be corrected with vitamin K if necessary.
8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: The swelling has resolved, but there is a question of distal stenosis of the left subclavian artery. The patient's strength, sensation, and pulses in the left arm will continue to be monitored.
9. Dysphonia: The patient's dysphonia is due to a cuffed tracheostomy. The decision to change to a smaller cuff will be made once respiratory status improves. An ENT consult will be sought as an outpatient.
10. Mental Status: The patient is alert and oriented x3. His mental status has improved, but he remains frustrated with the long ICU stay. Frequent reorientation and maintaining a sleep-wake cycle will continue. Ativan has been held, and Zyprexa will be given PRN for agitation.
11. CV: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the CK level was elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No ischemic EKG changes have been observed.
12. Tremor: The patient has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands. The differential includes side effects of levophed, neuropathy from chronic illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Monitoring will continue, and a workup will be initiated if the tremor persists after more acute issues resolve."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   Likely there is also cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic
   heart disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to
   obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin
   for most of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced
   rhythm to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday and able to wean levophed overnight. Pt may
   require intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Consider Digoxin to improve systolic function.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. VBG at end of PS trial yesterday
   indicates that patient not dramatically fatigued. Per RT, patient was
   empirically switched back to A/C to prevent tiring overnight. Pt also
   has bilateral large pleural effusions which may require therapeutic tap
   to improve respiratory status.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials x6-8hrs daily as tolerated, with
   close VBG monitoring. Continue A/C overnight.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge on [**4-25**], gastro-occult
   positive, now bilious. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing
   and decreased in volume. Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS
   trending down. Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital
   course likely due to shock liver.  Pain DDx included gastric ulcer,
   cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to
   liver.  Pain resolved w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller
   abd abscess, persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w
   abscess vs. infarct. Pt c/o persisent [**3-24**] abd
cramps
   - Pain largely resolved. Continue to monitor.

      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.

   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - F/U further heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stools
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but holding heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock and multiorgan failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, intra-abdominal fungal and gram-negative bacterial abscesses, acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), anemia of chronic disease, coagulopathy likely secondary to subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and poor nutrition, left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia due to tracheostomy, mental status changes, and a history of coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of renal failure: The patient's current acute renal failure could progress further, leading to an increase in serum creatinine levels and potential need for continued renal replacement therapy.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple ongoing infections, including C. difficile colitis and intra-abdominal abscesses, which may require additional treatment and monitoring.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient's pre-existing ischemic heart disease and reduced EF make him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain
   central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP
   measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin for most
   of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced rhythm
   to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday and able to wean levophed overnight. Pt may require
   intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Consider Digoxin to improve systolic function.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each
   day. Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-22**]. Now on meropenem, which
   should cover GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum
   cultures negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component
   of anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety. Likely also has element of deconditioning and muscle weakness.
   - Will trial PSV, when/if pt becomes dyspneic/tachypneic, will check
   VBG. If hypercarbic, deconditioning will be more likely than anxiety.
   If hypocarbic, anxiety likely playing greater role in respiratory
   distress.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge on [**4-25**], gastro-occult
   positive, now bilious. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing
   and decreased in volume. Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS
   trending down. Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital
   course likely due to shock liver.  Pain DDx included gastric ulcer,
   cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to
   liver.  Pain resolved w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller
   abd abscess, persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w
   abscess vs. infarct. Pt c/o [**3-24**] abd
cramps
 [**4-27**].
   - Pain largely resolved. Continue to monitor.
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. TTE negative for vegatations.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], [**4-27**]- Cefepime [**Date range (1) 8471**] (Serratia,
   Klebsiella and Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in
   peritoneum -     duration 14 days)
      #. [**Date range (1) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. Was on CVVH due to tenuous
   blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per patient
s family, no more CVVH. Had HD/UF
   yesterday to remove 2L fluid. Will continue with HD per renal.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD this week. Will d/w Renal.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to pneumonia complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia. He has been in the ICU for a prolonged period and has developed various complications. These include abdominal pain and abscess, leukocytosis treated for Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia, oliguric acute on chronic renal failure, anemia of chronic disease with ongoing hemolysis, coagulopathy likely due to shock liver, subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and poor nutrition. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, and a previous CABG surgery. He currently requires intermittent pressor support, CVVH, and is on multiple antibiotics for intra-abdominal and respiratory infections. The patient's mental status has improved but he remains frustrated with the prolonged ICU stay. The plan is to continue with aggressive management of his medical conditions and provide supportive care."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to obtain
   central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP
   measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin for most
   of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced rhythm
   to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday and able to wean levophed overnight. Pt may require
   intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Consider Digoxin to improve systolic function.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. VBG at end of PS trial yesterday
   indicates that patient not dramatically fatigued. Per RT, patient was
   empirically switched back to A/C to prevent tiring overnight.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated earlier in day with
   close VBG monitoring.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2168-8-20**] abdominal pain [**4-25**]. Gastric
   contents changed from bilious to maroon sludge on [**4-25**], gastro-occult
   positive, now bilious. Stool guaiac negative. Pigtail output clearing
   and decreased in volume. Amylase/Lipase normal. No nausea. LFTS
   trending down. Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital
   course likely due to shock liver.  Pain DDx included gastric ulcer,
   cholangitis, diverticulitis +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to
   liver.  Pain resolved w/Fentanyl.  CTAbd [**4-25**] shows slightly smaller
   abd abscess, persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w
   abscess vs. infarct. Pt c/o persisent [**3-24**] abd
cramps
   - Pain largely resolved. Continue to monitor.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. TTE negative for vegatations.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], [**4-27**]- Cefepime [**Date range (1) 8471**] (Serratia,
   Klebsiella and Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in
   peritoneum -     duration 14 days)
      #. [**Date range (1) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   - Continue Cefepime for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. Was on CVVH due to tenuous
   blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per patient
s family, no more CVVH. Had HD/UF
   yesterday to remove 2L fluid. Will continue with HD per renal.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD this week. Will d/w Renal.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH. Also
   evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat Super
   Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of active
   ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U
   frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative [**4-23**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement.

The patient's current infectious issues include Clostridium difficile colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/green-nosed bacterial abscess. The patient has leukocytosis and is being treated for Serratia and Klebsiella hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as a new liver/spleen abscess. The patient is also being treated for C. difficile colitis.

The patient has oliguric, acute-on-chronic renal failure/uremia and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) to remove 2 liters of fluid. The patient has anemia of chronic disease and evidence of ongoing hemolysis, along with low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor nutrition. The patient has a positive result for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but a subsequent test for serotonin release assay (SRA) was negative.

The patient has swelling in the left upper extremity, which has resolved. There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and other comorbidities. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing hypotension and new liver/spleen abscesses suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and his current ventilation status is being managed with the help of a ventilator.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT/PTT/inr, indicating a coagulation disorder that may increase the risk of bleeding or clotting.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe colitis and lead to complications such as perforation or sepsis.
5. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen due to his current condition and the stress on the cardiovascular system.
6. Anemia/Hemolysis: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and elevated reticulocyte count suggest anemia, which could be due to chronic kidney disease or hemolysis.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for pressure ulcers and infections.
8. Malnutrition: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with initial admission with sepsis and now s/p trach/PEG
   with intra-abdominal collection under drainage but may in fact be
   driving in part sustained SIRS and hypotension with difficult to wean
   pressor support.  Patient does have severe impairment in cardiac
   function which may be contributing in addition to persistent
   compromise.  She with PSV trials for fixed duration has had continued
   good tolerance.  He has maintained reasonable mental status and
   participation throughout.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Flagyl/Vanco/Meropenem/Fluc
   -Levophed weaned to off
   -Will move to D/C Vasopressin today
   -Midodrine will be weaned to off next
   -ECHO results reassuring
   2)Respiratory Failure-Reasonable tolerance at this time of PSV
   limitations are likely motor weakness, however, he has been able to
   maintain adequate ventilation in the setting of significant pleural
   effusions.
   -PSV during the day
   -Full support overnight (may be in PSV at higher pressures as well)
   3)Abdominal Abscess-
   -Continue drainage
   -Continue antibiotics
   4)Renal Failure-
   -Continue with HD
   -[**Month (only) 60**] need pressor support during HD
   5)Coagulopathy-
   -Appreciate Heme input
   -Will provide FFP
   -Will continue to replace Vita K

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with initial admission for sepsis. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has an intra-abdominal collection under drainage, which may be contributing to sustained Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and hypotension. The patient also has severe impairment in cardiac function, making weaning off pressor support difficult.

The patient's current medical conditions include sepsis, respiratory failure, abdominal abscess, renal failure, and coagulopathy. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics, drainage of the abdominal abscess, hemodialysis for renal failure, and providing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy management.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's severe cardiac impairment may pose a risk for further deterioration. The respiratory failure could progress if the patient is unable to maintain adequate ventilation, especially during nighttime when full support is required. The abdominal abscess should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or complications. Renal function should also be closely monitored during hemodialysis sessions.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is DNR (do not res"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:  Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   Likely there is also cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic
   heart disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to
   obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin
   for most of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced
   rhythm to 90 on [**4-28**] with improvement in BP. Pt may continue to require
   intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Restart Digoxin (w/ load) to improve systolic function and support
   BP.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.  Titrate pressors to goal
   SBP >90, appropriate mental status, lactate level.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. Pt also has bilateral large pleural
   effusions which may require therapeutic tap to improve respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials x6-8hrs daily as tolerated, with
   close VBG monitoring. Continue A/C overnight.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. TTE negative for vegetations on [**4-27**].
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when meropenem is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes. Will discuss removal of pigtail
   with IR.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], [**4-27**]- Cefepime [**Date range (1) 8471**] (Serratia,
   Klebsiella and Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in
   peritoneum -  duration 14 days)
      #. [**Date range (1) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. Was on CVVH due to tenuous
   blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per patient
s family, no more CVVH. Will continue
   with HD per renal.  Renally dosing medications.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs.
   - q24h bladder scans. Straight cath if <300cc, c/o lower abd pain or
   q48h.
   - Continue EPO.
   - Plan for tunneled line placement today with IR.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Has had evidence of ongoing
   hemolysis and low-grade DIC for most of hospitalization. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Per heme current anemia
   likely a result of frequent blood draws and loss during HD, plus
   possible component of meropenem side effect. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia or Hct <21 given h/o delayed
   transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U frozen for this patient and is
   working to obtain more from the Red Cross.
   - F/U further heme recs: f/u hemolysis labs, guaiac stools
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   - Folate and B12 levels normal. F/U MMA.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Per heme, coagulopathy also related to medication side
   effect and splenic sequestration. Platelets gradually decreasing over
   the course of the hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative
   [**4-23**]. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube
   daily.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per Heme: Vit K 10mg PO daily x 3 days (last day [**2167-4-30**]).
   - Will give 2 U platelets and 4U FFP prior to tunnelled line placement
   today.
   - Suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but holding heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, currently in the ICU for septic shock and multiorgan failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP. The patient has been treated for various infections including C. diff colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/GNR abscess. The patient's conditions include shock/hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, oliguric acute on chronic ARF/uremia, anemia, coagulopathy, left upper extremity swelling, dysphonia, mental status changes, cardiovascular stability, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock and may continue to require intermittent pressors during hemodialysis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and may need continued ventilatory support with pressure support trials.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has been treated for several infections, including Serratia and Klebsiella HAP, C. diff colitis, and intra-abdominal abscess.
4. Oliguric Acute on Chronic ARF/Uremia: The patient is in acute renal failure and may require continued hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to chronic disease, frequent blood draws, loss during hemodialysis, and possible medication side effects"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Per Renal: HD tmrw ([**4-29**]). Straight cath q48h for urine output. OK to
   place tunnelled HD line.
   - To get tunnelled line in AM; ordered 2 units plts and 4 units FFP to
   reverse INR
   - Per Heme: Current anemia likely NOT due to hemolysis, more a result
   of frequent blood draws and loss during HD, plus possible meropenem
   side effect. Current thrombocytopenia likely nutritional,
   medication-induced, +/- splenic sequestration. Per Heme recs, started
   Vit K 10mg PO daily, no platelets unless <10K or bleeding & <50K, Sent
   B12, folate, MMA, daily hemolysis & DIC labs.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:  Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   Likely there is also cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic
   heart disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to
   obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin
   for most of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced
   rhythm to 90 on [**4-28**] with improvement in BP. Pt may continue to require
   intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Consider Digoxin to improve systolic function.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.  Goals: MAP 60, SBP 90,
   clear mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. Pt also has bilateral large pleural
   effusions which may require therapeutic tap to improve respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials x6-8hrs daily as tolerated, with
   close VBG monitoring. Continue A/C overnight.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. TTE negative for vegetations on [**4-27**].
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when meropenem is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], [**4-27**]- Cefepime [**Date range (1) 8471**] (Serratia,
   Klebsiella and Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in
   peritoneum -  duration 14 days)
      #. [**Date range (1) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. Was on CVVH due to tenuous
   blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per patient
s family, no more CVVH. Will continue
   with HD per renal.  Renally dosing medications.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs.
   - q24h bladder scans. Straight cath if <300cc, c/o lower abd pain or
   q48h.
   - Continue EPO.
   - Plan for tunneled line placement today with IR.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Has had evidence of ongoing
   hemolysis and low-grade DIC for most of hospitalization. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Per heme current anemia
   likely a result of frequent blood draws and loss during HD, plus
   possible component of meropenem side effect. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia or Hct <21 given h/o delayed
   transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U frozen for this patient and is
   working to obtain more from the Red Cross.
   - F/U further heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stools
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   - F/U B12, folate, MMA and adjust vitamin supplementation as needed.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Per heme, coagulopathy also related to medication side
   effect and splenic sequestration. Platelets gradually decreasing over
   the course of the hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative
   [**4-23**]. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube
   daily.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per Heme: Vit K 10mg PO daily x 3 days (last day [**2167-4-30**]).
   - Will give 2 U platelets and 4U FFP prior to tunneled line placement
   today.
   - Suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but holding heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   - Per Heme: Current anemia likely NOT due to hemolysis, more a result
   of frequent blood draws and loss during HD, plus possible meropenem
   side effect. Current thrombocytopenia likely nutritional,
   medication-induced, +/- splenic sequestration. Per Heme recs, started
   Vit K 10mg PO daily, no platelets unless <10K or bleeding & <50K, Sent
   B12, folate, MMA, daily hemolysis & DIC labs. Also requested nutrition
   consult.

   rhythm to 90 on [**4-28**] with improvement in BP. Pt may continue to require
   intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Consider Digoxin to improve systolic function.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.  Goals: MAP 60, SBP 90,
   clear mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. Pt also has bilateral large pleural
   effusions which may require therapeutic tap to improve respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials x6-8hrs daily as tolerated, with
   close VBG monitoring. Continue A/C overnight.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Treated for Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Currently
   undergoing Tx for intra-abdominal abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8398**]
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6515**] [**Last Name (un) **]) and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-17**], pigtail in
   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. TTE negative for vegetations on [**4-27**].
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when meropenem is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.
   - Antibiotic Course for Length of Stay:
      #. [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 8462**], [**Date range (1) 8463**], [**4-27**]- Cefepime [**Date range (1) 8471**] (Serratia,
   Klebsiella and Citrobacter freundii - sputum, and Serratia in
   peritoneum -  duration 14 days)
      #. [**Date range (1) **] ([**4-16**]-  (C. parapsilosis in peritoneal, urine and sputum -
   course weeks)
      #. PO Vanc ([**4-9**]-    (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of other
   ATBx)
      #. Metronidazole IV ([**4-9**]-  (C. diff - course 2+ weeks after d/c of
   other ATBx)
      #. CTX ([**Date range (1) 8464**]) - for Serratia/Klebsiella PNA, switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   for CVVH compatibility
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. Was on CVVH due to tenuous
   blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per patient
s family, no more CVVH. Will continue
   with HD per renal.  Renally dosing medications.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs.
   - q24h bladder scans. Straight cath if <300cc, c/o lower abd pain or
   q48h.
   - Continue EPO.
   - Plan for tunneled line placement today with IR.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Has had evidence of ongoing
   hemolysis and low-grade DIC for most of hospitalization. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Per heme current anemia
   likely a result of frequent blood draws and loss during HD, plus
   possible component of meropenem side effect. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia or Hct <21 given h/o delayed
   transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U frozen for this patient and is
   working to obtain more from the Red Cross.
   - F/U further heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stools
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   - F/U B12, folate, MMA and adjust vitamin supplementation as needed.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Per heme, coagulopathy also related to medication side
   effect and splenic sequestration. Platelets gradually decreasing over
   the course of the hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative
   [**4-23**]. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube
   daily.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per Heme: Vit K 10mg PO daily x 3 days (last day [**2167-4-30**]).
   - Will give 2 U platelets and 4U FFP prior to tunneled line placement
   today.
   - Suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but holding heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease, presenting with septic shock and multi-organ failure due to CAP PNA complicated by VAP. He has been on CVVH with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient's infectious issues include C. diff colitis and intra-abdominal fungal/GNR abscess. He has oliguric, acute-on-chronic ARF/uremia, anemia of chronic disease, and likely medication-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient also has a coagulopathy due to shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor nutrition. He is currently on various medications, including vasopressin, dextrose, and midodrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension in the setting of septic shock. He had early goal-directed therapy with an Apache IV score of 114. PNA, C. diff, and intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis. There is also a cardiogenic component to shock due to ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient may continue to require intermittent pressors during hemodialysis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS in the setting of PNA. He was intubated and placed on assist control ventilation. His tolerance for pressure support has been increasing each day. Recent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a tracheostomy in place and is receiving vasopressin to support blood pressure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is also experiencing anemia, likely due to frequent blood draws and ongoing hemodialysis, as well as thrombocytopenia, possibly related to medication use or nutritional deficiencies. The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and a nutrition consult has been requested. His blood glucose levels have been elevated, and glycemic control is being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory condition, COPD, has led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's chronic heart failure may lead to further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart attack.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, potentially requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.
4. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy, and malnutrition. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications including vasopressin, dextrose, and multiple antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in the ICU.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT formation.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest can predispose him to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Hypotension: The patient's current hypotension, which is not in shock, should be closely monitored and managed to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which can lead to further complications such as infections or delayed wound healing.
7. Sepsis: Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and recent infections, there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:  Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   Likely there is also cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic
   heart disease with EF 20%. Had A-line pulled on [**4-19**] and are unable to
   obtain central pressure monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if
   cuff BP measurements are accurate. Has required levophed/vasopressin
   for most of past few weeks. Continues on Midodrine TID. Increased paced
   rhythm to 90 on [**4-28**] with improvement in BP. Pt may continue to require
   intermittent pressors during HD.
   - Restart Digoxin (w/ load) to improve systolic function and support
   BP.
   - Continue weaning vasopressin as tolerated.  Titrate pressors to goal
   SBP >90, appropriate mental status, lactate level.
   .
   #. Resp failure: Initially [**3-16**] ARDS in setting of PNA. Patient trached
   on [**4-1**]. On Vent, Assist Control. Increasing tolerance for  PS each
   day. Most recent BAL and sputum cultures negative. Will reevaluate if
   spikes fever. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of anxiety contributing to dyspnea.
   Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for anxiety. Likely also has element of
   deconditioning and muscle weakness. Pt also has bilateral large pleural
   effusions which may require therapeutic tap to improve respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials x6-8hrs daily as tolerated, with
   close VBG monitoring. Continue A/C overnight.
   .

   place. Also being treated for C.diff colitis. CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-22**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-25**] CT abd/pelvis shows slightly smaller abd abscess,
   persistent hypodensities in liver/spleen potentially c/w abscess vs.
   infarct. TTE negative for vegetations on [**4-27**].
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 day course (complete [**5-2**]) and fluconazole
   for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when meropenem is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-25**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. Unable  to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to further
   characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes. Will discuss removal of pigtail
   with IR.
   - F/U beta-glucan to evaluate for systemic candidiasis.

   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. Was on CVVH due to tenuous
   blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no evidence of
   obstruction found. Per patient
s family, no more CVVH. Will continue
   with HD per renal.  Renally dosing medications.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs.
   - q24h bladder scans. Straight cath if <300cc, c/o lower abd pain or
   q48h.
   - Continue EPO.
   - Plan for tunneled line placement today with IR.
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Has had evidence of ongoing
   hemolysis and low-grade DIC for most of hospitalization. Stool guaiac
   negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs positive
   (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-17**] Coombs neg. Per heme current anemia
   likely a result of frequent blood draws and loss during HD, plus
   possible component of meropenem side effect. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia or Hct <21 given h/o delayed
   transfusion reaction. Blood bank has 1 U frozen for this patient and is
   working to obtain more from the Red Cross.
   - F/U further heme recs: f/u hemolysis labs, guaiac stools
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday.
   - Check PM hct and transfuse to maintain Hct >21
   - Folate and B12 levels normal. F/U MMA.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Per heme, coagulopathy also related to medication side
   effect and splenic sequestration. Platelets gradually decreasing over
   the course of the hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-18**], but SRA negative
   [**4-23**]. **Pt needs separate order for platelet count in yellow top tube
   daily.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per Heme: Vit K 10mg PO daily x 3 days (last day [**2167-4-30**]).
   - Will give 2 U platelets and 4U FFP prior to tunnelled line placement
   today.
   - Suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but holding heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian. Continue to monitor
   strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2167-4-7**]. Got PMV on [**4-6**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned. Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.
   CAD: CABG [**2146**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2160**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.

   Agree with excellent MSIV note above.  Briefly, pt. is a 82 yo M
   admitted with sepsis.  He continues to require pressors.  This is
   currently felt to be more related to heart failure than to infectious
   causes.  Will plan to load with digoxin today.
   Also today patient will have a tunneled HD line placed.  Will receive 4
   units of FFP and 2 packs of platelets prior to procedure.
   Will stop daily hemolysis labs as patient has not had any evidence
   thereof.  Will only check post-transfusion.
   Will try to get pt. OOB to chair again today and continue PS trials on
   trach mask.
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease and recent admission for septic shock and multi-organ failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with intermittent pressor requirement. The patient has multiple complications including C. difficile colitis, intra-abdominal fungal/greenberg abscess, acute kidney injury, anemia of chronic disease, coagulopathy due to shock liver, subacute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and left upper extremity swelling. The patient's mental status has improved, but he still requires frequent reorientation. He is on multiple medications including vasopressin, levophed, midodrine, and antibiotics for various infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient continues to require intermittent pressors, indicating persistent hypotension. Restarting digoxin may help improve systolic function and support blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS and was intubated. He is now on assist control mode with tracheostomy in place. Increasing tolerance for pressure support (PS) trials should be continued, with close monitoring of ventilation and blood gases.
3. Oliguric Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/Uremia: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to anuria and acute kidney injury. CVVH has been initiated, and the plan is to"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with evidence of persistent hypotension in the setting of
   both impared cardiac function and recent and slow to resolve sepsis.
   He did have some modest improvement with HR increase but not clearly
   durable across time.  In the setting of continued fluid removal with
   dialysis there has been some trend to improved tolerance of PSV.  The
   primary limiting factor does remain the persistent hypotension and
   intermittent requirement for vasopressor use.  He has had intermittent
   trials on PSV support but has been limited by tachypnea and what
   appears to be respiratory muscle fatigue.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue with nutrition support, OOB to chair, trial of PSV
   support
   -He has limiting factors of likely significant weakness as well as
   possible volume overload although this appears less dominant
   -PSV today x 2-4 hours total
   Hypotension-
   -Vanco/Flagyl/Meropenem
   -Vasopressin Continuing but will look to wean off
   -Maintain lactate monitoring, will need to consider a-line monitoring
   if unable to keep reliable measurements
   -Goal SBP at 90 will be reasonable minimum
   -Will restart digoxin today to aid with CO which appears to be
   contributing to persistent hypotension
   -IR to re-eval drain for function
   Renal Failure-Acute and Chronic-
   Epogen
   -Tunnel catheter today
   -Continue with HD
   -Baldder scans to continue and straight cath as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently on hemodialysis. He also has impaired cardiac function and is being treated with vasopressin for hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/52 to 123/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode. His set tidal volume is 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure is 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure is 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen is 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, high blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. The patient's glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, symmetric chest expansion, dullness on percussion, and a tracheostomy tube in place. His cardiovascular examination shows normal first heart sound and distant second heart sound. His peripheral pulses are not assessed.
