   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old Russian lady w/ HTN, a-fib s/p AVN & PPM, HL, and Meniere's
   disease who was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or
   oxycodone, currently intubated due to inability to protect airway.
   1. Unresponsiveness- Potentially due to overdose as urine positive for
   benzodiazepenes and pinpoint pupils argue for some combination of
   temazepam and/or oxycodone use. It is unknown whether this was
   intentional or not as patient did not directly tell her husband,
   although this is what he had feared. Gastric lavage/activated charcoal
   not attempted in ED (perhaps due to timing?) no flumazenil given; high
   risk of seizure Other confounding factors are her known Meniere's
   disease, orthostatic hypotension from inappropriate use of
   anti-hypertensives (bp at time of fall unknown, and bp elevated in ED)
   or from poor PO intake. She has no known seizure disorder and did not
   display seizure-like activity as per report. Head CT was negative for
   intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke. (although her age,
   hyperlipidemia and hypertension are risk factors and her
   anticoagulation would put her at risk for hemorrhagic stroke).  Heart
   block unlikely, as pt paced. Infectious causes less likely given normal
   pan-scan-> might be focus of inflammation in transverse, asc, desc
   colon.
   - intubate [**2-22**] inability to protect airway; d/c propofol and re-assess
   MS, if ok-> attempt to extubate and obtain further history
   - supportive care on vent o/n, wean fio2 (currently at 100%)
   - check orthostatics once extubated
   - hold antihypertensives for now (hctz, valsartan, spironolactone)
   - hold benzo and narcotics
   - f/u Ucx
   - f/u toxicology c/s
   - psych c/s t  re: possible suicidal ideation
   -1:1 sitter/ suicide precautions
   2. Increased work of  breathing- PS 10/5-> increased to 15/5 and
   infiltrates on lung films could be [**2-22**] infectious process vs.
   aspiration PNA  vs. atelectasis vs. hemothorax from traumatic
   intubation.
   - will monitor respiratory status and hold antibiotic treatment for now
   -  check [**Hospital1 7**] HCT w/ concern for hemothorax
   - repeat CXR
   .
   3. Hyponatremia- baseline hyponatremia from hydrochlorothiazide use, as
   documented in previous geriatric notes. Could also be [**2-22**] poor PO
   intake.
   - run IVF NS 1000ml maintenance at 75cc/hr.
   - hold HCTZ
   - check electrolytes, consider urine lytes
   (pt has diastolic dysfunction w/ LVEF 65%)
   4. Elevated [**Name (NI) 11075**] husband denies alcohol use, although other
   toxins/medications can cause AST > ALT. Most likely reason is muscular
   injury/trauma especially in light of elevated CPK and ecchymoses on L
   shoulder and chest
    In light of other LFTs, being normal, will continue to monitor.
   .
   5. Afib- Patient is rate-controlled on carvedilol and anticoagulated
   with warfarin.
   - ct ICU monitoring
   - continue carvedilol 25mg daily
   - continue coumadin 3mg daily
   - follow INR
   .
   6. Elevated troponin- troponins trending upwards- no hx kidney disease
   this is likely [**2-22**] demand ischemia due to hypotension at time of fall,
   although Bp during that time unknown. MB not high, CPK likely elevated
   [**2-22**] muscle injury

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old Russian lady with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (afib) post atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacemaker placement, hyperlipidemia, and Meniere's disease. She was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or oxycodone and is currently intubated due to an inability to protect her airway.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Unresponsiveness: Potentially due to overdose as urine positive for benzodiazepines and pinpoint pupils argue for some combination of temazepam and/or oxycodone use. Other confounding factors are her known Meniere's disease, orthostatic hypotension from inappropriate use of anti-hypertensives or from poor PO intake.

2. Increased work of breathing: PS 10/5 increased to 15/5 and infiltrates on lung films could be [**2-22**] infectious process vs. aspiration pneumonia vs. atelectasis vs. hemothorax from traumatic intubation.

3. Hyponatremia: Baseline hyponatremia from hydrochlorothiazide use, as documented in previous geriatric notes. Could also be [**2-22**] poor PO intake.

4. Elevated CPK and ecchymoses on L shoulder and chest: Most likely reason is muscular injury/trauma.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old Russian lady w/ HTN, a-fib s/p AVN & PPM, HL, and Meniere's
   disease who was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or
   oxycodone, currently intubated due to inability to protect airway.
   1. Unresponsiveness- Potentially due to overdose as urine positive for
   benzodiazepenes and pinpoint pupils argue for some combination of
   temazepam and/or oxycodone use. It is unknown whether this was
   intentional or not as patient did not directly tell her husband,
   although this is what he had feared. Gastric lavage/activated charcoal
   not attempted in ED (perhaps due to timing?) no flumazenil given; high
   risk of seizure Other confounding factors are her known Meniere's
   disease, orthostatic hypotension from inappropriate use of
   anti-hypertensives (bp at time of fall unknown, and bp elevated in ED)
   or from poor PO intake. She has no known seizure disorder and did not
   display seizure-like activity as per report. Head CT was negative for
   intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke. (although her age,
   hyperlipidemia and hypertension are risk factors and her
   anticoagulation would put her at risk for hemorrhagic stroke).  Heart
   block unlikely, as pt paced. Infectious causes less likely given normal
   pan-scan-> might be focus of inflammation in transverse, asc, desc
   colon.
   - intubate for now, as inability to protect airway; re-assess MS [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 11074**]fol in AM, if ok-> attempt to extubate in AM and obtain further
   history
   - supportive care on vent o/n, wean fio2 (currently at 100%)
   - check orthostatics once extubated
   - hold antihypertensives for now (hctz, valsartan, spironolactone)
   - hold benzo and narcotics
   - f/u Ucx
   - psych consult in AM re: possible suicidal ideation
   -1:1 sitter
   .
   2. Hyponatremia- baseline hyponatremia from hydrochlorothiazide use, as
   documented in previous geriatric notes. Could also be [**2-22**] poor PO
   intake.
   - run IVF NS 1000ml maintenance at 75cc/hr.
   - hold HCTZ
   - check lytes in AM, consider urine lytes
   (pt has diastolic dysfunction w/ LVEF 65%)
   3. Elevated [**Name (NI) 11075**] husband denies alcohol use, although other
   toxins/medications can cause AST > ALT. In light of other LFTs, being
   normal, will continue to monitor.
   .
   4. Afib- Patient is rate-controlled on carvedilol and anticoagulated
   with warfarin.
   - ct ICU monitoring
   - continue carvedilol 25mg daily
   - continue coumadin 3mg daily
   - follow INR
   .
   5. Elevated troponin- no hx kidney disease, will roMI w/ CE x3, could
   be [**2-22**] demand ischemia (hypoperfusion? Bp at time of fall unknown ). MB

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart block, hyperlipidemia, and Meniere's disease. She was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or oxycodone and is currently intubated due to an inability to protect her airway. The patient's urine tested positive for benzodiazepines, indicating possible overdose. However, the intentionality of the overdose is unclear as the patient did not directly inform her husband, who had feared this possibility.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hyponatremia (low sodium levels), elevated liver enzymes (ALT > AST), atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), and elevated troponin levels (indicating possible cardiac damage).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/70 to 171/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, with set tidal volume of 400 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 390, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

   Imaging: CXR ([**2123-11-18**]) bibasilar densities, loss of diaphragmatic
   contours, consistent with expanding effusions or evolving pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof s/p fall incontext of medication overdose (benzidiazepines,
   ?narcotics).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 intubated primarily for airway proterction in
   context of altered mental status.  Evidence for expanding pleural
   effusions (possible blood) and infiltrate (possible aspiration
   pneuomonia).   Would assess for pleural effusion with ultrasound, and
   consider diagnostic thoracentesis.  Would maintain low threshold to
   initiate empirircal antimicrobials.  Monitor SaO2, CXR, hope to work
   towards extubation, although may be limited to evolving pneumonia or
   bleeding.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possible expanding fluid, but need to consider
   hemothorax.  Monitor Hct.
   MENTAL STATUS
 altered attributed to medication ingestion
   (sedatives).  Would favor discontinuation of sedation to assess
   neurological status.  D/C propofol and asses neurological state (will
   require Russian interpreter, and possible hearing aids).
   OVERDOSE
 unclear as to specific ingestion, but candidates include
   benzodiazepine and narcotics.  Toxicology consultation performed.
   Absence of Concern for intentional overdose / suicide attempt
 will
   require 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry consultation once awake and
   extubated.
   ELEVATED CPK
 likely due to trauma from fall.  Need to monitor serial
   CPK.  If continues to increase, at risk for rhabdomyalisis.
   s/p FALL
 Neck brace.  Need to await final interpretation prior to
   discontinuing neck brace.
   A-FIB
 chronic, now paced.  Continue coumadin if no further
   procedures.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Plan replete, monitor I/O.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Possible related to diuretic use.  Doubt responsible for
   altered mental status, but may be contributing (mildly).  IV NS,
   monitor Na.
   CHRONIC PAIN
 chronic narcotics and benzodiazepine use.  Monitor for
   withdrawal symptoms.  Need to establish optimal medical regimen for
   pain and anxiety control.  Will consider dilaudid (on background of
   Fentanyl patch) perhaps in combination with NSAID, in addition to
   benzodiazepine.  Consider Pain Service consult.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. He has respiratory failure, marked decreased hearing acuity, and altered mental status due to medication overdose (benzodiazepines, possibly narcotics). The patient also has pleural effusions, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, chronic atrial fibrillation, and a history of fall with potential trauma. He requires nutritional support, pain management, and glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates the severity of his respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration or complications related to the ventilator.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has expanding pleural effusions, which can lead to tension pneumothorax or hemothorax if not managed properly.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia needs to be addressed promptly to prevent shock and organ damage.
4. Hyponatremia: Correcting the patient's hyponatremia is necessary to avoid complications such as seizures or neurological damage.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty in communication and decision-making.
6. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation, potentially leading to stroke"

   Imaging: CXR ([**2123-11-18**]) bibasilar densities, loss of diaphragmatic
   contours, consistent with expanding effusions or evolving pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof s/p fall incontext of medication overdose (benzidiazepines,
   ?narcotics).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 intubated primarily for airway proterction in
   context of altered mental status.  Evidence for expanding pleural
   effusions (possible blood) and infiltrate (possible aspiration
   pneuomonia).   Would assess for pleural effusion with ultrasound, and
   consider diagnostic thoracentesis.  Would maintain low threshold to
   initiate empirircal antimicrobials.  Monitor SaO2, CXR, hope to work
   towards extubation, although may be limited to evolving pneumonia or
   bleeding.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possible expanding fluid, but need to consider
   hemothorax.  Monitor Hct.
   MENTAL STATUS
 altered attributed to medication ingestion
   (sedatives).  Would favor discontinuation of sedation to assess
   neurological status.  D/C propofol and asses neurological state (will
   require Russian interpreter, and possible hearing aids).
   OVERDOSE
 unclear as to specific ingestion, but candidates include
   benzodiazepine and narcotics.  Toxicology consultation performed.
   Absence of Concern for intentional overdose / suicide attempt
 will
   require 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry consultation once awake and
   extubated.
   ELEVATED CPK
 likely due to trauma from fall.  Need to monitor serial
   CPK.  If continues to increase, at risk for rhabdomyalisis.
   s/p FALL
 Neck brace.  Need to await final interpretation prior to
   discontinuing neck brace.
   A-FIB
 chronic, now paced.  Continue coumadin if no further
   procedures.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Plan replete, monitor I/O.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Possible related to diuretic use.  Doubt responsible for
   altered mental status, but may be contributing (mildly).  IV NS,
   monitor Na.
   CHRONIC PAIN
 chronic narcotics and benzodiazepine use.  Monitor for
   withdrawal symptoms.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending evaluation.

   - appreciate psych recs -> B12 and folate normal 2 mos ago
   - 24 hr sitter pending psych re-eval
   - reassess c-spine this am and repeat CT if still painful
   2. Pleural effusion: Most likely related to aspiration pneumonitis in
   setting of fall. Patient is on anticoagulation and had a R main stem
   intubation, so hemothorax possible; hct is down, but stable this am.
   Radiographic appearance does not suggest heart failure.
   - will monitor respiratory status and oxygenation

   3. Hypertension
 BP has not been elevated overnight on carvedilol
   alone.
   - Cont to hold HCTZ, valsartan, spironolactone
   - Check orthostatics now that patient is extubated
   4. Hyponatremia
 Resolved with IVF and stopping diuretics.
   - Cont to hold HCTZ
   5. Elevated AST- Resolved
   6. Afib- Remains in paced rhythm.
   - continue carvedilol 25mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unclear chief complaint. The patient was extubated and placed on CPAP/PSV mode with supplemental oxygen. Pain control medications were administered due to reported pain. A repeat CT scan of the spine was ordered to assess any potential injuries. A 24-hour sitter was also ordered. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/69 mmHg to 129/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,882 mL, including 578 mL through IV fluids, and an output of 955 mL through urine and 140 mL through blood products. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. Blood gas analysis indicates normal oxygenation and ventilation. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's inability to respond. Lab results show within normal limits for most parameters, with slightly elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin T levels. Assessment and plan include risks for aspiration, procedure-related hemorrhage or hematoma, and the need for ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old Russian lady w/ HTN, a-fib s/p AVN & PPM, HL, and Meniere's
   disease who was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or
   oxycodone, currently intubated due to inability to protect airway.
   1. Unresponsiveness- Potentially due to overdose as urine positive for
   benzodiazepenes and pinpoint pupils argue for some combination of
   temazepam and/or oxycodone use. It is unknown whether this was
   intentional or not as patient did not directly tell her husband,
   although this is what he had feared. Gastric lavage/activated charcoal
   not attempted in ED (perhaps due to timing?) no flumazenil given; high
   risk of seizure Other confounding factors are her known Meniere's
   disease, orthostatic hypotension from inappropriate use of
   anti-hypertensives (bp at time of fall unknown, and bp elevated in ED)
   or from poor PO intake. She has no known seizure disorder and did not
   display seizure-like activity as per report. Head CT was negative for
   intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke. (although her age,
   hyperlipidemia and hypertension are risk factors and her
   anticoagulation would put her at risk for hemorrhagic stroke).  Heart
   block unlikely, as pt paced. Infectious causes less likely given normal
   pan-scan-> might be focus of inflammation in transverse, asc, desc
   colon.
   - intubate [**2-22**] inability to protect airway; d/c propofol and re-assess
   MS, if ok-> attempt to extubate and obtain further history
   - supportive care on vent o/n, wean fio2 (currently at 100%)
   - check orthostatics once extubated
   - hold antihypertensives for now (hctz, valsartan, spironolactone)
   - hold benzo and narcotics
   - f/u Ucx
   - f/u toxicology c/s
   - psych c/s t  re: possible suicidal ideation

   2. Increased work of  breathing- PS 10/5-> increased to 15/5 and
   infiltrates on lung films could be [**2-22**] infectious process vs.
   aspiration PNA  vs. atelectasis vs. hemothorax from traumatic
   intubation.
   - will monitor respiratory status and hold antibiotic treatment for now
   -  check [**Hospital1 7**] HCT w/ concern for hemothorax
   - repeat CXR
   .
   3. Hyponatremia- baseline hyponatremia from hydrochlorothiazide use, as
   documented in previous geriatric notes. Could also be [**2-22**] poor PO
   intake.
   - run IVF NS 1000ml maintenance at 75cc/hr.
   - hold HCTZ
   - check electrolytes, consider urine lytes
   (pt has diastolic dysfunction w/ LVEF 65%)
   4. Elevated [**Name (NI) 11075**] husband denies alcohol use, although other
   toxins/medications can cause AST > ALT. Most likely reason is muscular
   injury/trauma especially in light of elevated CPK and ecchymoses on L
   shoulder and chest
    In light of other LFTs, being normal, will continue to monitor.
   .
   5. Afib- Patient is rate-controlled on carvedilol and anticoagulated
   with warfarin.
   - ct ICU monitoring
   - continue carvedilol 25mg daily
   - continue coumadin 3mg daily
   - follow INR
   .
   6. Elevated troponin- troponins trending upwards- no hx kidney disease
   this is likely [**2-22**] demand ischemia due to hypotension at time of fall,
   although Bp during that time unknown. MB not high, CPK likely elevated

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old Russian lady with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, AV nodal block, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and Meniere's disease. She was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or oxycodone. She is currently intubated due to her inability to protect her airway. The patient has pinpoint pupils, which indicate the use of benzodiazepines or opioids. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 125/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is being paced for heart rhythm. The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi in her chest, cold extremities with poor capillary refill, and ecchymoses on her shoulder and chest. Her neurological examination shows sedation and downgoing toes bilaterally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to the suspected overdose of benzodiazepines or opioids. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and consider reversing the effects of benzodiazepines with flumazenil if necessary.
2. Increased work of breathing: The patient has increased work of breathing with infiltrates on lung films, suggesting the possibility of pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, atelectasis, or hemothorax from traumatic intubation"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old Russian lady w/ HTN, a-fib s/p AVN & PPM, HL, and Meniere's
   disease who was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or
   oxycodone, s/p intubation due to inability to protect airway.
   1. Altered mental status
 Suspect due to overdose on temazepam +/-
   oxycodone. Status post fall with negative imaging, although C spine
   tenderness on exam yesterday. Remains unclear whether this was
   intentional or not.  Successfully extubated yesterday. Tox signed off;
   psych following and will reassess now that patient awake and
   communicative.
   - avoid benzos, would also hold fentanyl patch
   - minimize narcotics (low dose hydromorphone)
   - f/u Ucx (UA negative)
   - appreciate psych recs -> B12 and folate normal 2 mos ago
   - 24 hr sitter pending psych re-eval
   - Repeat CT c-spine today
   2. Pleural effusion: Most likely related to aspiration pneumonitis in
   setting of fall. No fever, leukocytosis, or sx suggesting pneumonia.
   Patient is on anticoagulation and had a R main stem intubation, so
   hemothorax possible; hct is down, but stable this am. Radiographic
   appearance shows improvement in effusion and does not suggest heart
   failure. No O2 requirement.
   - will monitor respiratory status and oxygenation
   - Daily CXR for now
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct
   - Follow Scx
   3. Hypertension
 BP has not been elevated overnight on carvedilol
   alone.
   - Cont to hold HCTZ, valsartan, spironolactone
   - Check orthostatics now that patient is extubated
   4. Hyponatremia
 Resolved with IVF and stopping diuretics.
   - Cont to hold HCTZ
   5. Elevated AST- Resolved
   6. Afib- Remains in paced rhythm.
   - continue carvedilol 25mg daily
   - continue coumadin 3mg daily
   - follow INR
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO, will advance diet after CT and clearance of c-spine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation post atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacemaker placement, hyperlipidemia, and Meniere's disease. She was admitted for suspected overdose on temazepam and/or oxycodone and required intubation due to an inability to protect her airway. The patient has been successfully extubated. She is awake and alert, following commands. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 125/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has ecchymoses on her left shoulder, sternum, and left chest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to an overdose on temazepam and/or oxycodone. Psychiatric follow-up is planned to reassess the patient now that she is awake and communicative. The patient should be monitored for any signs of deterioration or worsening mental status.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which is most likely related to aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of a fall. The effusion appears to be improving based on radiographic appearance, and the patient does"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof s/p fall incontext of medication overdose (benzidiazepines,
   ?narcotics).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 stable following extubation.  (intubated
   primarily for airway protection in context of altered mental status).
   Evidence for expanding pleural effusions (possible blood) and
   infiltrate (possible aspiration pneuomonia).   Would assess for pleural
   effusion with ultrasound, and consider diagnostic thoracentesis.  Would
   maintain low threshold to initiate empirircal antimicrobials.  Monitor
   SaO2, CXR, hope to work towards extubation, although may be limited to
   evolving pneumonia or bleeding.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possible expanding fluid, but need to consider
   hemothorax.  Monitor Hct.
   MENTAL STATUS
 altered attributed to medication ingestion
   (sedatives).  Would favor discontinuation of sedation to assess
   neurological status.  D/C propofol and asses neurological state (will
   require Russian interpreter, and possible hearing aids).
   OVERDOSE
 unclear as to specific ingestion, but candidates include
   benzodiazepine and narcotics.  Toxicology consultation performed.
   Absence of Concern for intentional overdose / suicide attempt
 will
   require 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry consultation once awake and
   extubated.
   ELEVATED CPK
 likely due to trauma from fall.  Need to monitor serial
   CPK.  If continues to increase, at risk for rhabdomyalisis.
   s/p FALL
 Neck brace.  Need to await final interpretation prior to
   discontinuing neck brace.
   A-FIB
 chronic, now paced.  Continue coumadin if no further
   procedures.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Plan replete, monitor I/O.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Possible related to diuretic use.  Doubt responsible for
   altered mental status, but may be contributing (mildly).  IV NS,
   monitor Na.
   CHRONIC PAIN
 chronic narcotics and benzodiazepine use.  Monitor for
   withdrawal symptoms.  Need to establish optimal medical regimen for
   pain and anxiety control.  Will consider dilaudid (on background of
   Fentanyl patch) perhaps in combination with NSAID, in addition to
   benzodiazepine.  Consider Pain Service consult.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending evaluation.

","The patient is an 82-year-old female who presented with altered mental status and was found to have respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has a history of medication overdose with benzodiazepines and possibly narcotics. There is evidence of expanding pleural effusions, which could be due to blood or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's mental status is attributed to medication ingestion, specifically sedatives, and it is recommended to discontinue sedation to assess neurological status. The patient also has elevated CPK levels, likely due to trauma from a fall, and will require monitoring.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yof s/p fall incontext of medication overdose (benzidiazepines,
   ?narcotics).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 stable following extubation.  (intubated
   primarily for airway protection in context of altered mental status).
   Evidence for expanding pleural effusions (possible blood) and
   infiltrate (possible aspiration pneuomonia).   Would assess for pleural
   effusion with ultrasound, and consider diagnostic thoracentesis.  Would
   maintain low threshold to initiate empirircal antimicrobials.  Monitor
   SaO2, CXR.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possible expanding fluid, but need to consider
   hemothorax.  Monitor Hct.
   MENTAL STATUS
  Much improved.  Altered attributed to medication
   ingestion (sedatives).
   OVERDOSE
 unclear as to specific ingestion, but candidates include
   benzodiazepine and narcotics.  Toxicology consultation performed.
   24-hr sitter and Psychiatry consultation in progress.
   ELEVATED CPK
 likely due to trauma from fall.  Need to monitor serial
   CPK.  If continues to increase, at risk for rhabdomyalisis.
   s/p FALL
 Neck brace.  Need to await final interpretation prior to
   discontinuing neck brace.  Neck CT unrevealing.  Orthopedic
   consultation to assist in management of neck brace.
   A-FIB
 chronic, now paced.  Continue coumadin if no further
   procedures.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Plan replete, monitor I/O.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Possible related to diuretic use.  Doubt responsible for
   altered mental status, but may be contributing (mildly).  IV NS,
   monitor Na.
   CHRONIC PAIN
 chronic narcotics and benzodiazepine use.  Monitor for
   withdrawal symptoms.  Need to establish optimal medical regimen for
   pain and anxiety control.  Will consider dilaudid (on background of
   Fentanyl patch) perhaps in combination with NSAID, in addition to
   benzodiazepine.  Consider Pain Service consult.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending evaluation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and altered mental status following a fall. She was intubated for airway protection and remains extubated at this time. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, likely due to the resolution of the medication overdose (sedatives). 

The patient has multiple medical issues including chronic atrial fibrillation, paced rhythm, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, chronic pain, and nutritional support needed. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pleural Effusions: The patient may have expanding pleural effusions, which could be due to blood or aspiration pneumonia. An ultrasound should be performed to assess the effusion, and a diagnostic thoracentesis may be considered. Empirical antimicrobials should be initiated, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) and chest X-ray (CXR) should be monitored.

2. Overdose: The patient may have ingested benzodiazepines and/or narcotics. Toxicology consultation has been performed, and a 24-hour sitter and Psychiatry consultation are in progress.

3. Elevated CPK: The patient's creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels are elevated, likely due to trauma from the fall. Serial CPK monitoring is necessary, and if the levels continue to increase, there is a risk for rhabdomyolysis.

4. Fall-related injuries: The patient's neck injury"

   evolving pneumonia or bleeding.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possible expanding fluid, but need to consider
   hemothorax.  Monitor Hct.
   MENTAL STATUS
 altered attributed to medication ingestion
   (sedatives).  Would favor discontinuation of sedation to assess
   neurological status.  D/C propofol and asses neurological state (will
   require Russian interpreter, and possible hearing aids).
   OVERDOSE
 unclear as to specific ingestion, but candidates include
   benzodiazepine and narcotics.  Toxicology consultation performed.
   Absence of Concern for intentional overdose / suicide attempt
 will
   require 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry consultation once awake and
   extubated.
   ELEVATED CPK
 likely due to trauma from fall.  Need to monitor serial
