","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension following a pelvic fracture caused by being struck by a car. The patient also has left-sided hemiplegia and is unresponsive. The CT/CTA showed a large right cerebral hemisphere perfusion deficit. The patient was intubated and underwent angiography to assess the perfusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The family declined the placement of a ventriculostomy and made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 63 bpm
- Blood pressure: 121/43 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Spontaneous ventilation: 598 mL

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following values:
- White blood cell count: 12.8 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 26%
- Platelet count: 87 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 171 mg/dL
- Calcium level: 6.6 mg/dL
- Magnesium level: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphate level: 3"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension due to a pelvic fracture. The patient also has left-sided hemiplegia and is unresponsive. The patient underwent invasive ventilation after experiencing an acute medical change, and a CT/CTA revealed a large right cerebral hemisphere perfusion deficit. The patient's condition is complicated by poor perfusion of the internal carotid artery. The patient's family has declined the placement of a ventriculostomy and has made the decision to be DNR (do not resuscitate), but will continue with medical treatment and labs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to ensure adequate gas exchange.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's left-sided hemiplegia and unresponsiveness indicate significant neurological compromise. Regular neurologic assessments and monitoring of intracranial pressure are necessary to identify any further deterioration or potential complications such as increased intracranial pressure or cerebral edema.
3. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension requires careful monitoring and management to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is crucial.
4. Infection: Prolonged invasive ventilation and immobility increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
