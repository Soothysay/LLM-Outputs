","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill appearing individual who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They have a history of jaundice, dry mucous membranes, and a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness and a positive fluid wave suggestive of ascites. There are signs of chronic venous stasis and edema in the lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient exhibits asterixis and is unresponsive to questions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening CXR and need for intubation indicate acute respiratory failure. This may be due to their underlying chronic condition or an acute exacerbating factor.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's jaundice, asterixis, and altered mental status suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is often seen in patients with advanced liver disease, which may be indicated by the presence of ascites and portal gastropathy on endoscopy.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The positive guaiac test suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be a result of the patient's underlying chronic condition or an acute event.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's labs show abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels, indicating an electrolyte imbalance that may require correction.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate chronic an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH
   cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered
   mental status and now found to have SBP.
   # Respiratory failure. Concern for pneumonia vs.  fluid overload vs
   ascites. Also would consider TRALI as received multiple blood products.
   Likely a combination of these etiologies. Overnight respiratory status
   worsened. CXR showed worsening R lung infiltrates vs. edema. Levaquin
   added to cover for atypicals. Given 20 mg lasix x 2 with large urine
   output, but continued respiratory distress. Intubated for persistently
   increased work of breathing.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - daily CXR
   - diuresis with goal 1-2 L net negative today
   - on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl for pneumonia
   coverage
   -sputum cxs
   - consider discussing with IP diagnostic thoracentesis of left pleural
   effusion
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units in ICU
   yesterday, crit currently 20.9.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse as needed
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease
   - if continued bleeding consider GI c/s for repeat scope
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable in setting of receiving 8 units of blood products.
   - continue multiple peripheral IVs, low threshold for central line
   placement
   - continue antibiotics for SBP, pneumonia
   - f/u cx
   - IVF bolus for MAP<65 or UOP<30
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely encephalopathy in the setting of
   infection. Head CT negative at OSH. No history of encephalopathy.
   - ceftriaxone
   - albumin 1.5g/kg now and 1g/kg on day 3
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on presentation,
   now 9.7.  Afebrile. Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Worsening
   CXR concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Blood cx pending. Negative UA,
   urine cx pending. Lactate 2.6 on presentation. Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone as above
   - flagyl for aspiration coverage, levaquin for atypicals

   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel pending
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed alcohol (EtOH) cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and subsequently developed septic shock and respiratory failure. He was found down at home and is now intubated in the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes chronic EtOH abuse, leading to cirrhosis. He has received multiple blood products due to acute blood loss anemia and ongoing bleeding from grade one varices and portal gastropathy as seen on endoscopy. The patient's current vital signs show stable pressures in the setting of receiving 8 units of blood products, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, dry mucous membranes, endotracheal tube in place, decreased breath sounds in the left lower and right upper lung fields, crackles, regular heart rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur throughout the precordium, distended abdomen, brown guaiac positive stool, and 3+ lower extremity edema with signs of chronic venous stasis bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.7 K/uL, thrombocytopen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH (ethanol) cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and was found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including hypotension, altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute blood loss anemia, cirrhosis, and EtOH abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, hypovolemia, or blood loss. This may require further investigation and treatment to stabilize the patient's blood pressure.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy caused by infection. Immediate management includes administering antibiotics and lactulose to reduce ammonia levels in the blood.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an underlying infection. Given the presence of SBP, it is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's response.

4. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are low, indicating acute blood loss. He has already received blood transfusions but may require additional units. It is also necessary to evaluate the cause of the blood loss, potentially through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to assess for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and now found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, altered mental status, leukocytosis, cirrhosis, and EtOH abuse. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Pneumonia: The worsening CXR suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which could be due to aspiration or infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's altered mental status and presumed cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and other cognitive impairments.
3. Variceal bleeding: The presence of grade I varices seen on endoscopy indicates a risk for variceal bleeding, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis.
4. Hepatic hydrothorax: This is a complication associated with cirrhosis where fluid accumulates in the pleural space.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that can occur in advanced liver disease.
6. Hepatic artery thrombosis: This is a rare but serious complication that can occur in patients with cirrhosis.

Overall, the patient is critically"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is currently in the ICU due to several complications. The patient presented with respiratory distress last evening, consistent with pulmonary edema, and was given lasix with fair effect. However, the patient eventually required intubation for work of breathing.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is sedated and intubated, with respiratory support on a ventilator. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 25 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals icteric sclera, pinpoint reactive pupils, rales on the back and decreased lung sounds at the right base, distended abdomen with fluid wave, and anasarca (generalized swelling).

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with cirrhosis and has developed pulmonary edema, leading to the need for intubation and invasive ventilation. The patient also has portal hypertension with grade I esophageal varices, but no active bleeding. There is evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by the low Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 8. The patient is anemic with a Hct of 20.9%. There is impaired skin integrity due to pressure ulcers. The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to their underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension, rather than acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are abnormal, with hyponatremia (Na+ of 105 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K+ of 2.5 mEq/L). The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with AST and ALT levels more than twice the upper limit of normal. There is evidence of renal dysfunction, with an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a decreased urine output.

The patient's medical history is significant for cirrhosis, but no other significant past medical history or allergies are mentioned. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and vasopressors, as indicated by the infusion lines noted in the medication section.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hepatic encephalopathy, worsening renal function,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH
   cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered
   mental status and now found to have SBP.
   # Respiratory failure. Concern for pneumonia vs.  fluid overload vs
   ascites. Also would consider TRALI as received multiple blood products.
   Likely a combination of these etiologies. Overnight respiratory status
   worsened. CXR showed worsening R lung infiltrates vs. edema. Levaquin
   added to cover for atypicals. Given 20 mg lasix x 2 with large urine
   output, but continued respiratory distress. Intubated for persistently
   increased work of breathing.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - daily CXR

   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], crit stable 22.9.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse as needed
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease
   - if continued bleeding consider GI c/s for repeat scope
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   - continue multiple peripheral IVs
   - continue antibiotics for SBP, pneumonia
   - f/u cx
   - IVF bolus for MAP<65 or UOP<30
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely encephalopathy in the setting of
   infection. Head CT negative at OSH. No history of encephalopathy. Now
   intubated and sedated
   - ceftriaxone
   - albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on presentation,
   now 10.8.  Afebrile. Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP.
   Peritoneal fluid growing rare GNRs. Worsening CXR concerning for
   multifocal pneumonia. Blood cx pending. Negative UA, urine cx pending.
   Lactate 2.6 on presentation. Hemodynamically stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and now found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia, fluid overload, and/or ascites. The patient received multiple blood products, which raises the possibility of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). His vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing respiratory support. The patient also has acute blood loss anemia, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices. He has been transfused with red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. His altered mental status is likely due to encephalopathy secondary to infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has decreased breath sounds in the left lower and right upper lung fields, along with crackles, suggesting pneumonia. Fluid overload and ascites may also contribute to his respiratory distress. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI): The patient received multiple blood products, which raises the possibility of TRALI. This condition can lead to acute respiratory distress and hypoxia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from esophageal varices. He has received blood transfusions and is at risk for further bleeding.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic illness, jaundice, and chronic venous stasis in the lower extremities. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but there are some concerning findings. The patient has decreased breath sounds in the left lower and right upper lung fields, along with crackles. The patient also has a distended abdomen, brown guaiac positive stool, and evidence of chronic venous stasis in the lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and signs of renal dysfunction. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and potential hepato-renal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a complication of liver dysfunction where toxins accumulate in the blood and affect brain function. Symptoms can include confusion, altered mental status, and sleep disturbances.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased breath sounds and crackles indicate possible pneumonia or worsening of underlying lung disease. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and hypoxia.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of chronic venous stasis and edema increases the risk of skin breakdown and ulcers. These can lead to infection and poor wound healing.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH
   cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered
   mental status and now found to have SBP.
   # Respiratory failure. Concern for pneumonia vs.  fluid overload vs
   ascites. Also would consider TRALI as received multiple blood products.
   Likely a combination of these etiologies. Overnight respiratory status
   worsened. CXR showed worsening R lung infiltrates vs. edema. Levaquin
   added to cover for atypicals. Given 20 mg lasix x 2 with large urine
   output, but continued respiratory distress. Intubated for persistently
   increased work of breathing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and is now diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia, fluid overload, or ascites. The patient received multiple blood products and is experiencing worsening respiratory distress. He was intubated for increased work of breathing. The patient also has acute blood loss anemia, with a hematocrit of 15 at the OSH and 17 on arrival to the ED. He has received a total of 4 units of RBCs and 4 units of FFP in the ICU. His critical status is stable with a hematocrit of 22.9. The patient's hypotension is attributed to evolving sepsis for peritoneal infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, or blood loss. He is currently receiving multiple peripheral IVs, antibiotics for SBP and pneumonia, and IVF bolus for MAP <65 or UOP <30. The patient's altered mental status is likely encephalopathy in the setting of infection. He has leukocytosis with a WBC of 14.1 on presentation, now 10.8. He has peritoneal fluid growing rare GNRs, worsening CXR concerning for multifocal pneumonia, and blood cx pending. The patient's cirrhosis is confirmed by RUQ u/s showing cirrhosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and now found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has worsening lung infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia or fluid overload. The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet tidal volumes and increased PEEP to 15. Diuretics are being used for fluid removal with a goal of 1 L negative balance per day.

2. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit was low on admission, and he has received blood transfusions. The source of bleeding is likely from esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, as indicated by an EGD showing grade one varices. The patient's critical status is stable at 22.9%.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable since admission, but there is a concern for evolving sepsis due to peritoneal infection and possible pneumonia. The patient is receiving multiple peripheral IVs, a PICC line, and antibiotics for SBP and pneumonia. Fluid boluses will be given if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is less than 65 or urine output is less than 30 mL/hr.

4. Altered mental status: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH
   cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered
   mental status and now found to have SBP.
   # Respiratory failure. Concern for pneumonia vs.  fluid overload vs
   ascites. Also would consider TRALI as received multiple blood products.
   Likely a combination of these etiologies. Intubated [**6-18**] after CXR
   showed worsening R lung infiltrates vs. edema. Ceftriaxone started,
   Flagyl, Levaquin added to cover for atypicals. Treated with 20 mg IV
   lasix intermittently with good diuresis.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450
   - daily CXR
   - diuresis with goal 1 L negative
   - on ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl for pneumonia coverage, each day
   4
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], crit now slowly trending down to 20.9.  No frank areas of
   bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse as needed
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease
   - if continued bleeding consider GI c/s for repeat scope
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   - continue multiple peripheral IVs
   - PICC in IR today
   - continue antibiotics for SBP, pneumonia
   - f/u cx
   - IVF bolus for MAP<65 or UOP<30
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely encephalopathy in the setting of
   infection. Head CT negative at OSH. No history of encephalopathy. Now
   intubated and sedated.
   - ceftriaxone
   - albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on presentation,
   now 10.8.  Afebrile. Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP.
   Peritoneal fluid growing rare GNRs. Worsening CXR concerning for
   multifocal pneumonia. Blood cx pending. Negative UA, urine cx pending.
   Lactate 2.6 on presentation. Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone as above
   - flagyl for aspiration coverage, levaquin for atypicals
   - d/c vanco
   - repeat diagnostic SBP to evaluate for improvement
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel pending
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable
   .
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, lactulose

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and now found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, altered mental status, leukocytosis, cirrhosis, and EtOH abuse.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings due to worsening lung infiltrates, possibly secondary to pneumonia or fluid overload. Weaning FiO2 as tolerated and daily CXR are planned.

2. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has received blood transfusions for his low hematocrit levels, but further monitoring of his critical values and transfusion as needed will be required. Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

3. Hypotension: The patient's differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, and blood loss. Pressures have been stable since admission, so continuing multiple peripheral IVs, PICC line, and antibiotics for SBP and pneumonia are planned.

4. Altered mental status: The patient likely has encephalopathy in the setting of infection. Head CT was negative at the outside hospital, and there is no history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status and later found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He was intubated on 6/18 after a chest X-ray showed worsening right lung infiltrates vs. edema. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings at 450cc, weaning FiO2 as tolerated. He is also on ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl for pneumonia coverage. The patient has leukocytosis/SBP with a WBC of 14.1 initially, now 10.1. Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP, growing rare GNRs. There is worsening CXR concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Blood culture pending. Negative UA, urine culture pending. Lactate was 2.6 on presentation. Hemodynamically stable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure. Concern for pneumonia vs. fluid overload vs ascites. Also would consider TRALI as received multiple blood products. Likely a combination of these etiologies. Intubated [**6-18**] after CXR showed worsening R lung infiltrates vs. edema. Ceftriaxone started, Flagyl, Levaquin added to cover for atypicals. 20mg IV lasix initially ineffective, given 40mg IV lasix after Cr stable at 1"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presented after being found down at home with altered mental status and now found to have SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia, fluid overload, and/or ascites. He is also hypotensive and has leukocytosis/SBP, acute blood loss anemia, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on ARDSnet settings on the ventilator. He is being weaned off FiO2 as tolerated and will continue with daily chest X-rays. Diuresis with Lasix will be continued to manage fluid overload.
2. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient's WBC count has decreased from 14.1 to 10.1, indicating a response to treatment. He is being given antibiotics to cover for SBP.
3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit was low on presentation and he received blood transfusions. His creatinine is trending down, and he will continue to receive RBC transfusions as needed.
4. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing encephalopathy due to infection. He is being given albumin and lactulose to manage this condition.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has confirmed cirrhosis secondary"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed alcohol (EtOH) cirrhosis who presents with altered mental status and subsequent findings of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), respiratory failure, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening lung infiltrates, fluid overload, and suspected pneumonia. The respiratory support will need to be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.

2. SBP: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, as indicated by the presence of rare Gram-negative rods in the peritoneal fluid. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole) to cover for various pathogens. Regular monitoring of white blood cell counts and follow-up blood cultures are necessary to assess the response to treatment.

3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels indicate acute blood loss anemia, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. He has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will be required to guide further transfusion needs.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable since admission,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including chronic anemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ascites, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. 

24-hour events include the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, administration of red blood cell transfusions, and adjustment of antibiotic regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/63 mmHg to 148/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal negative results for urinary Legionella and sputum Gram stain.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, lasix, pantoprazole, and various other ICU medications. The patient's allergies are not documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding indicates a risk of further bleeding episodes.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's SBP can"

   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit yesterday, appropriate Hct bump to 24, now
   26.  No frank areas of bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease
   - if continued bleeding consider GI c/s for repeat scope

   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely encephalopathy in the setting of
   infection. Head CT negative at OSH. No history of encephalopathy. Now
   intubated and sedated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting after being found down at home with altered mental status and now found to have SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). He also has respiratory failure due to pneumonia and fluid overload. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is suffering from fluid overload and suspected pneumonia. He has been started on ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and Levaquin for pneumonia coverage.
2. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. He has been diagnosed with SBP, and his peritoneal fluid is growing serratia. Blood cultures are pending.
3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels were low upon admission, indicating acute blood loss. He has received multiple units of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which could be due to evolving sepsis, possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, or blood loss. His pressures are stable since admission.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely encephalopathy in the setting of infection. He has received albumin and lactulose for treatment.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH
   cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered
   mental status and now found to have SBP, family meeting scheduled
   tomorrow.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia and SBP suspected.  In addition,
   suffering from fluid overload, net negative 1.7L yesterday, Cr at 0.9.
   Lasix gtt at 10.  Ceftriaxone started, Flagyl, Levaquin added to cover
   for atypicals.  Sputum and Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.
   CT continues to show opacities in lungs with anasarca.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - daily CXR
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix
   - on ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl for pneumonia coverage, each day
   6
   .
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 10.2.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth .  Blood cx pending,
   recent UCx pending. Negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.  ID
   would repeat tap if more ascites, not to send BCx in bottles due to
   dilutional effect, continue abx.
   - ceftriaxone, flagyl for aspiration coverage, levaquin for atypicals
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx
   - Obtain CT torso for possible other sources of peritonitis.
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit, appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 26.  No frank
   areas of bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease
   - if continued bleeding consider GI c/s for repeat scope
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely encephalopathy in the setting of
   infection. Head CT negative at OSH. No history of encephalopathy. Now
   intubated and sedated.
   - received albumin
   - lactulose 45ml PO QID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable
   .
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and is now diagnosed with SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). He also has respiratory failure due to pneumonia and fluid overload, as indicated by a CT torso showing large left pleural effusion, diffuse areas of ground glass and airspace opacities, and evidence of portal hypertension including large ascites. The patient has received several units of blood transfusions due to acute blood loss anemia. His altered mental status is likely encephalopathy in the setting of infection. He has a history of EtOH abuse and cirrhosis confirmed by RUQ ultrasound. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with pneumonia and fluid overload leading to respiratory failure. The current management includes daily CXR, diuresis with Lasix, and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl) for pneumonia coverage.
2. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis and a left shift, which is consistent with SBP. Although the peritoneal fluid initially grew Serratia, the repeat preliminary result shows no growth. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is being continued on antibiotics.
3. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's hemat"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH
   cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered
   mental status and now found to have SBP, family meeting scheduled
   tomorrow.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   negative 1.7L yesterday, Cr at 0.9.  Lasix gtt at 10.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily, as a result, will d/c
   levoquin and flagyl, continue ceftriaxone, day 7.  CT continues to show
   opacities in lungs with anasarca.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - daily CXR
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix
   - on ceftriaxone, day 7.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 10.2.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth .  Blood cx pending,
   recent UCx pending. Negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.  ID
   would repeat tap if more ascites, not to send BCx in bottles due to
   dilutional effect, continue abx.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit, appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 26.  No frank
   areas of bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy, bowel movements
   becoming too frequent, will decrease lactulose.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH (ethanol) cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and was found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's respiratory status is complicated by fluid overload with ascites, net negative 1.7L yesterday, and an elevated creatinine level of 0.9. The sputum and peritoneal cultures show no growth, so the patient will discontinue levofloxacin and metronidazole, while continuing ceftriaxone.

The patient has leukocytosis/SBP with a WBC count of 14.1 initially, now at 10.2. The CT torso shows no abscess, and the peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. The initial peritoneal fluid grew serratia, but the repeat preliminary results show no growth. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is hemodynamically stable. The patient will continue with ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia.

The patient has acute blood loss anemia, with a hematocrit of 15 at the OSH and 17 in the ED. He has received a total of four units of red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the ICU. No frank areas of bleeding were observed. The patient will continue to monitor his critical levels and transfuse for hematocrit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). He is currently in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for respiratory failure, leukocytosis/SBP, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, altered mental status, and cirrhosis. The patient is still actively drinking and has not been evaluated for EtOH abuse. His liver disease is believed to be due to chronic alcohol use. He has received blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes as needed, and started on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is ongoing monitoring of his respiratory status. There is a concern for fluid overload with ascites, but the net negative balance of 880 ccs yesterday indicates that fluid removal is being managed appropriately. The goal is to continue weaning PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) as tolerated.

2. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis and evidence of SBP. He has been started on ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia. Blood and peritoneal cultures are pending, so it is important to monitor his white blood cell count and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Acute blood loss anemia"

   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He has received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 24.8
   from 26.
   - continue to monitor crits and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an ICU admission with altered mental status. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and chronic anemia. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula and has arterial and peripheral IV lines in place. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current bleeding.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient may develop further infections in the peritoneal cavity.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's lung function may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status may worsen due to liver dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or kidney dysfunction.
6. Impaired skin integrity: Pressure ulcers or bedsores may develop due to prolonged immobility.
7. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function"

The patient is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. Family meeting was held, during which the patient showed poor insight into the extent of disease and prognosis. The patient has been receiving various medications, including lasix, levofloxacin, metronidazole, ceftriaxone, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and others. 

Vital signs are as follows: temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's weight is stable. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,682 mL and output of 4,210 mL, with negative balance of -528 mL. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 223 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed in various areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others.

   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   negative 600 ccs yesterday, Cr at 1.0.  Lasix gtt at 12.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.  Continue ceftriaxone (day
   1= [**6-18**]).  CXR appears unchanged today.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix gtt
   - on ceftriaxone, day 8.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 9.9.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth.  Blood cx pending,
   negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, peritoneal cx
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 23.1
   from 24.9 last night.  Hemodynamically stable and no active signs of
   bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   negative 600 ccs yesterday, Cr at 1.0.  Lasix gtt at 12.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.  Continue ceftriaxone (day
   1= [**6-18**]).  CXR appears unchanged today.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix gtt
   - on ceftriaxone, day 8.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 9.9.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth.  Blood cx pending,
   negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, peritoneal cx
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 23.1
   from 24.9 last night.  Hemodynamically stable and no active signs of
   bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable
   .
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH (ethanol) cirrhosis presenting after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) due to respiratory failure, leukocytosis/SBP, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.

Respiratory Failure: The patient is suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net negative 600 ccs yesterday. His creatinine level is at 1.0. He is receiving lasix gtt at 12. Sputum and peritoneal cultures show no growth preliminarily. He will continue to receive ceftriaxone (day 1=[**6-18**]). His ARDSnet tidal volumes are currently maintained at 450cc given his height, and he is continuing to wean PEEP as tolerated. Diuresis with a goal of -1L per day will continue with lasix gtt.

Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient had an initial WBC count of 14.1 with a left shift on presentation, now at 9.9. He is afebrile. A CT torso with no abscess was performed, and peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial peritoneal fluid growing serratia, repeat preliminary shows no growth. Blood cultures are pending,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, leukocytosis/SBP, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and is being treated with ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia. He is also on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and diuretics for fluid overload. The patient's father has confirmed that his liver disease is likely due to alcohol abuse. The patient is still actively drinking and requires social work consult for EtOH abuse. The patient's condition remains stable, but he is at risk for potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is suffering from fluid overload with ascites, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if fluid accumulation continues.
2. SBP: Although the patient is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of SBP due to his compromised immune system and presence of peritoneal infection.
3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, but there is a risk of further blood loss and the need for additional transfusions.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, hypovolem"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a chronically ill-appearing individual with altered mental status. They have been diagnosed with several medical conditions including gastrointestinal bleed, peritonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte and fluid disorder, chronic anemia, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including nutrition support through a pulmonary formula, arterial and peripheral IV lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and require urgent intervention.

2. ARDS: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, a severe lung condition that can result in respiratory failure and difficulty in oxygenation.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may cause hepatic encephalopathy, leading to altered mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can disrupt cardiac function and other vital organ functions.

5. Infection: The presence of peritonitis and previous C. difficile infection indicates a high risk of developing further infections in the ICU setting.

6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload,"

   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   negative 600 ccs yesterday, Cr at 1.0.  Lasix gtt at 12.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.  Continue ceftriaxone (day
   1= [**6-18**]).  CXR appears unchanged today.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix gtt
   - on ceftriaxone, day 8.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 9.9.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth.  Blood cx pending,
   negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, peritoneal cx
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 23.1
   from 24.9 last night.  Hemodynamically stable and no active signs of
   bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 150. Likely secondary to lasix diuresis.
   -increase free water with tube feeds
   -IV D5W
   -check PM lytes
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient is sedated and unable to provide their own medical history. They have been diagnosed with various conditions including gastrointestinal bleed, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cirrhosis, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hypernatremia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if they do not respond to weaning off the ventilator and maintaining adequate oxygenation.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy could progress if liver function deteriorates further, leading to increased confusion, altered mental status, and potential development of coma.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient may develop complications related to SBP, such as worsening infection, sepsis, or organ failure if the current antibiotic therapy is not effective.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding could reoccur or worsen if portal hypertension and portal gastropathy are not adequately managed.
5. Hypernatremia: If the patient's hypernatremia is not corrected, it may lead to severe neurological complications.
6. Circulatory Collapse: Due to the patient's low blood pressure and signs of hypoperfusion, there"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   positive 2L, Cr rising, now at 1.2.  Lasix gtt at 12.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.  Continue ceftriaxone (day
   1= [**6-18**]).
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix gtt
   - on ceftriaxone, day 9.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 12.2.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth.  Blood cx pending,
   negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, peritoneal cx
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 24.5
   last night.  Hemodynamically stable and no active signs of bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 147. Likely secondary to lasix diuresis.
   -increase free water with tube feeds
   -IV D5W
   -check PM lytes
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable
   .
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, lactulose

","Summary:
- The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis.
- He presented after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, leukocytosis/SBP, acute blood loss anemia, hypernatremia, hypotension, altered mental status, and cirrhosis.
- He is being treated for these conditions with various medications, including ceftriaxone for respiratory infection and SBP, diuretics for fluid overload, packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma for blood loss, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and lactulose and therapeutic paracentesis for cirrhosis and ascites.
- The patient's sodium levels are elevated, possibly due to lasix diuresis.
- He has a history of active alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to high tidal volumes.
2. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a history of SBP. There is a risk of recurrence or progression of infection.
3. Acute blood loss anemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of presumed ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis. He presents with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has been found down at home and was brought to the hospital. He has a background of EtOH abuse and is still actively drinking per report.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute on chronic respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), gastrointestinal bleed, secondary to portal gastropathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to Serratia infection, liver cirrhosis secondary to ETOH, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypernatremia likely related to diuretic use.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of ARDS, gastrointestinal bleeding recurrence, development of sepsis due to SBP, further deterioration of liver function leading to hepatic failure, worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, and electrolyte imbalances due to diuretic use.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver function, and electrolyte levels. Appropriate interventions such as weaning off mechanical ventilation, managing fluid balance, administering antibiotics for SBP, and providing supportive care for hepatic encephalopathy and hypernatremia should be considered. The patient's EtOH abuse should also be addressed through counseling and social work consultation once extubated"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, altered mental status, and has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/48 mmHg to 135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin, and lactate levels, indicating potential hepatic dysfunction and tissue hypoperfusion. Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, which may require correction.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, the patient's current condition suggests a high risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as they are on mechanical ventilation. The presence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (melena) and evidence of portal gastropathy further increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications. The patient's history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy may also predispose them to further hepatic decomp"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   positive 2L, Cr rising, now at 1.2.  Lasix gtt at 12.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.  Continue ceftriaxone (day
   1= [**6-18**]).
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix gtt
   - on ceftriaxone, day 9.
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 12.2.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth.  Blood cx pending,
   negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, peritoneal cx
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 24.5
   last night.  Hemodynamically stable and no active signs of bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypernatremia: Na 147. Likely secondary to lasix diuresis.
   -increase free water with tube feeds
   -IV D5W
   -check PM lytes
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, lactulose

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presented to the ICU with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and is still actively drinking. He has been found down at home multiple times.

On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 121/50 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. His blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient has evidence of fluid overload with ascites, positive fluid wave on abdominal examination, and edema in the lower extremities. His creatinine level is steadily climbing, indicating renal dysfunction. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is also elevated. The arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.47 and bicarbonate level of 37.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 on presentation, which has now decreased to 12.2. The CT torso showed no abscess, but peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. The initial peritoneal fluid was growing serratia, but repeat preliminary results show no growth"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  likely related to ascitis. Currently maximizing
   vent setting and diuresing.
   # Leukocytosis/SBP:  Serratia, on CTX. Now BCx positive for GPC.
   Consider vancomycin. VS stable.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: HCT stable at 23 with pRBC transfusions.
   Etiology includes GI bleed with HC positive stool in ED but normal EGD
   (? Lower source). Also low Hapto and high bili suggestive of hemolysis
   (but cirrhosis may be responsive for high t bili). Continue PPI and
   montito HCT. HCT>21 goal.
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitis c/b SBP and c/b encephalopathy:
   improving fluid balcance with lasix. Consider adding spironolactone and
   possibly albumin to improve osmotic pressure. On lactulose for
   encephalopathy. On Abx for SBP. Consider therapeutic paracentesis. Cre
   cont to rise, and we may be entering HRS (consider diagnostic trial of
   albumin)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased settings and diuresis.
- Lab results show leukocytosis, positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci, and elevated creatinine levels.
- The patient has acute blood loss anemia, with a stable hematocrit level and transfusions of packed red blood cells.
- He is also experiencing altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
- Fluid balance is being improved with the use of lasix, and there is consideration for adding spironolactone and albumin to improve osmotic pressure.
- Therapeutic paracentesis is being considered, as the patient has ascites.
- The patient's condition is improving, but there are concerns about potential complications such as hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's rising creatinine levels and the presence of cirrhosis make him at risk for developing HRS, a form of kidney failure associated with liver disease.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This could be due to complications like pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs secondary to ascites.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  likely related to ascitis. Currently maximizing
   vent setting and diuresing. Will add 2^nd [**Doctor Last Name 23**] for diuresis.
   #Metabolic alkalosis: will add acetazolamide.
   # Leukocytosis/SBP:  Serratia, on CTX. Now BCx positive for GPC.
   Consider vancomycin. VS stable.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: HCT stable at 23 with pRBC transfusions.
   Etiology includes GI bleed with HC positive stool in ED but normal EGD
   (? Lower source). Also low Hapto and high bili suggestive of hemolysis
   (but cirrhosis may be responsive for high t bili). Continue PPI and
   monitor HCT. HCT>21 goal. Will check LDH and PBS.
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy. On lactulose
   30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitis c/b SBP and c/b encephalopathy:
   improving fluid balcance with lasix. Consider adding spironolactone and
   possibly albumin to improve osmotic pressure. On lactulose for
   encephalopathy. On Abx for SBP. Consider therapeutic paracentesis. Cre
   cont to rise, and we may be entering HRS (consider diagnostic trial of
   albumin, octreotide, midodrine)
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple complications related to his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to likely ascites causing respiratory failure. Ventilation settings are being maximized, and diuresis is being administered.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, and acetazolamide will be added to address this issue.
3. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient has leukocytosis and SBP, for which he is receiving antibiotics (Serratia on CTX). Considering the positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci (GPC), vancomycin may be considered.
4. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia, and packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions have been given. Further investigations are needed to determine the source of bleeding, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, and monitor the hematocrit (HCT) level.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He is being treated with lactulose to reduce ammonia levels.
6. Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites: The patient's underlying condition of alcoholic cirrhosis is leading to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  Suffering from fluid overload with ascites, net
   positive 2L, Cr rising, now at 1.2.  Lasix gtt at 12.  Sputum and
   Peritoneal Cx show no growth preliminarily.  Continue ceftriaxone (day
   1= [**6-18**]).
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes currently maintained given height at 450cc
   - continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - diuresis with goal -1L per day, continue Lasix gtt
   - on ceftriaxone, day 9.
   # Leukocytosis/SBP: Pt with WBC of 14.1 with left shift on
   presentation, now at 12.2.  Afebrile. CT torso with no abscess.
   Peritoneal fluid is consistent with SBP. Initial Peritoneal fluid
   growing serratia, repeat prelim shows no growth.  Blood cx pending,
   negative UA, ucx.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - ceftriaxone for pansensitive serratia
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - f/u blood cx, peritoneal cx
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hematocrit was 15 at the OSH and 17 on
   arrival to the ED here. He received one unit RBC at the OSH and one
   unit in the ED. Unknown baseline. No history of frank hematemesis of
   BRBPR but was guaiac positive in the ED. EGD showed grade one varices
   and portal gastropathy. Received total 4 units RBCs and 4 units FFP in
   ICU [**6-18**], received 1 unit (Date), appropriate Hct bump to 24, now 24.5
   last night.  Hemodynamically stable and no active signs of bleeding.
   - continue to monitor crits [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for Hct < 21
   - transfuse FFP for active bleeding
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypernatremia: Na 147. Likely secondary to lasix diuresis.
   -increase free water with tube feeds
   -IV D5W
   -check PM lytes
   # Hypotension: Differential includes evolving sepsis for peritoneal
   infection +/- possible pneumonia, hypovolemia, blood loss. Pressures
   stable since admission.
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - lactulose 30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   # Cirrhosis: Per pt's father, he has been worked up at [**Hospital1 5729**] and his liver disease is felt to be [**3-21**] EtOH.
   - RUQ u/s showed cirrhosis, moderate ascites, patent vessels,
   gallbladder sludge.
   - AFP 2.8
   - hepatitis panel negative for B and C
   - lactulose
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis when attempting to wean pt from
   vent
   # EtOH abuse: Pt is still actively drinking.
   - cover with CIWA scale
   - social work consult once stable
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has fluid overload with ascites, elevated creatinine levels, and respiratory failure. The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis. He also has acute blood loss anemia, hypernatremia, hypotension, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's liver disease is likely due to chronic alcohol use. He requires ICU care and management for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is suffering from fluid overload with ascites, which can worsen respiratory failure. Close monitoring and diuresis with Lasix are necessary.
2. SBP: The patient has leukocytosis and peritoneal fluid consistent with SBP. Antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone should be continued, and blood cultures should be monitored.
3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient received multiple units of RBCs and FFP due to acute blood loss. Hemodynamic stability should be maintained, and further transfusions may be required based on hematocrit levels.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level likely secondary to Lasix diuresis. Free water administration and electrolyte monitoring are necessary.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to evolving seps"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitis c/b SBP and c/b encephalopathy: (A)
   SBP: on ceftriaxone. (B) ascitis: overall still positive fluid balance,
   with aprx 100 cc/hr on lasix ggt. Problem is the high intake level.
   Will try to consolidate intake. Considering adding a second diuretic
   but furosemide appears effective currently. Acetazolamide added for
   metabolic acidosis. Will touch base with Liver re NG tube (in order to
   maintain po meds) in setting of variceal bleed and INR elevation.  (C)
   Encephalopathy: on lactulose and stable, responsive to commands today.
   (D) Synthetic function: INR and TB improving. Transaminitides stable.
   (E)  Cre stable and still able to make ample urine. No evidence of HRS
   at this time. (F) Varices (grade I esophageal varices s/p banding and
   portal gastropathy): will touch base with Liver re nadolol.
   # Respiratory failure:  likely related to ascites and vol overload.
   Improving respiratory parameters and more responsive. Attempt PS trial
   and possibly extubation today.
   # Leukocytosis:  Peritoneal fluid with Serratia, on CTX. Now BCx
   positive for GPC. Consider vancomycin. VS stable. Minitoring cultures
   from PICC with low threshold to remove.
   # Macrocytic anemia: HCT stable at 23 s/p pRBC on [**2140-6-21**]. Curently on
   folate supplementation (h/o etoh).  No evidence of Gi on EGD and absent
   hemolytic patters. Continue PPI and monitor HCT. HCT>21 goal.
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, lactulose
   # Access: pIV, PICC, A line placed

1. Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, which can lead to SBP and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. SBP: The patient is currently on ceftriaxone.
3. Ascites: The patient has a positive fluid balance, despite being on furosemide (Lasix). The high intake level is a problem, and the healthcare team is considering adding a second diuretic.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is on lactulose and stable, responsive to commands today.
5. Synthetic function: INR and TB improving. Transaminitides stable.
6. Renal function: Cre stable and still able to make ample urine. No evidence of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) at this time.
7. Varices: Grade I esophageal varices that have been banded, and portal gastropathy. The healthcare team will touch base with the liver specialist regarding nadolol.
8. Respiratory failure: Improving respiratory parameters and more responsive. Attempting a pressure support (PS) trial and possibly extubation today.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   # Respiratory failure:  likely related to ascitis. Currently maximizing
   vent setting and diuresing. Will add 2^nd [**Doctor Last Name 23**] for diuresis.
   #Metabolic alkalosis: will add acetazolamide.
   # Leukocytosis/SBP:  Serratia, on CTX. Now BCx positive for GPC.
   Consider vancomycin. VS stable.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: HCT stable at 23 with pRBC transfusions.
   Etiology includes GI bleed with HC positive stool in ED but normal EGD
   (? Lower source). Also low Hapto and high bili suggestive of hemolysis
   (but cirrhosis may be responsive for high t bili). Continue PPI and
   monitor HCT. HCT>21 goal. Will check LDH and PBS.
   # Altered mental status: Likely hepatic encephalopathy. On lactulose
   30ml PO TID, titrate to [**5-22**] BM daily
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitis c/b SBP and c/b encephalopathy:
   improving fluid balcance with lasix. Consider adding spironolactone and
   possibly albumin to improve osmotic pressure. On lactulose for
   encephalopathy. On Abx for SBP. Consider therapeutic paracentesis. Cre
   cont to rise, and we may be entering HRS (consider diagnostic trial of
   albumin, octreotide, midodrine)
   # FEN: blood products for resuscitation, replete electrolytes prn, tube
   feeds
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, lactulose

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current treatment involves maximizing ventilator settings and diuresis to remove excess fluid.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is being treated by adding acetazolamide to correct the pH imbalance.

3. Leukocytosis/SBP: The patient has leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) and SBP. The causative organism is Serratia, and the patient is being treated with ceftriaxone. Considering the patient's condition, vancomycin may also be considered.

4. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia, with a stable hematocrit (HCT) level of 23%. The patient has received packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions to manage the anemia. The source of the blood loss is suspected to be gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of hematochezia (blood in stool). However, a normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) suggests a lower gastrointestinal source. Monitoring the HCT and checking lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and peripheral blood smear (PBS) is recommended.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition seen in patients with cirrhosis. Treatment involves lactulose, which helps reduce ammonia levels in the blood.

6. Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, which increases the risk of SBP and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's fluid balance is being managed with lasix (furosemide), a diuretic. Considering the patient's condition, adding spironolactone and possibly albumin to improve osmotic pressure may be necessary. Therapeutic paracentesis, a procedure to remove excess fluid from the abdomen, is also being considered.

7. Hepatic respiratory syndrome (HRS): The patient's condition may progress to HRS, a form of renal failure seen in patients with advanced liver disease. Diagnostic trials of albumin, octreotide, and midodrine may be considered.

8. Other interventions: The patient requires blood products for resuscitation, repletion of electrolytes as needed, tube feeds for nutrition, pneumoboots for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and lactulose for"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   #Fever. Wbc also trending up, 16.4 today. Being treated with
   ceftriaxone for SBP with peritoneal fluid growing pansensitive
   serratia. BCx x 1 [**6-25**] shows coag neg staph, likely contaminant,
   although currently being covered with vancomycin. Increased secretions
   yesterday. Fever to 101.8, pancultured
   - needs sputum culture today
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely related to ascites and vol overload,
   also with likely aspiration on admission. Improving respiratory
   parameters and more responsive, however still appears fluid overloaded
   on exam, increased secretions.  RSBI 51 today.
   - lasix gtt d/c

   - consider extubation today
   # Cirrhosis: Thought likely to be [**3-21**] alcohol. EGD on admission shows
   grade I varices and portal gastropathy.  T. - continue lactulose
   # Leukocytosis:  Peritoneal fluid with Serratia, on CTX. Now BCx
   positive for GPC. Consider vancomycin. VS stable. Minitoring cultures
   from PICC with low threshold to remove.
   # Macrocytic anemia: HCT 22.4 from 23 s/p pRBC on [**2140-6-21**]. Curently on
   folate supplementation (h/o EtOH).

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been treated with ceftriaxone for SBP, and peritoneal fluid is growing pansensitive serratia. Blood cultures show coag-negative staph, likely a contaminant, although currently being covered with vancomycin. The patient has fever to 101.8, and pancultured. 

The patient also has respiratory failure likely related to ascites and volume overload, as well as likely aspiration on admission. His respiratory parameters are improving, and he appears more responsive, but still appears fluid overloaded on exam with increased secretions. RSBI is 51 today. 

In terms of cirrhosis, the patient is thought likely to be alcoholic. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on admission shows grade I varices and portal gastropathy. Treatment for cirrhosis includes continuing lactulose.

The patient also has leukocytosis with peritoneal fluid positive for serratia, on ceftriaxone. Blood cultures are positive for GPC, and considering vancomycin. Vital signs are stable, and cultures from the percutaneous intravenous catheter (PICC) with a low threshold to remove.

Additionally, the patient has macrocytic anemia with HCT 22.4 from 23 after packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion on [**2140-6-21**]. The patient is currently on folate supplementation due to a history of alcohol use.

Plan:
- Continue lactulose for cirrhosis
- Consider vancomycin for blood cultures positive for GPC
- PPI for prophylaxis
- IV PPI, lactulose for prophylaxis
- Replete electrolytes as needed
- Tube feeds
- Pneumoboots for prophylaxis
- A line placed
- Code status: Full code
- Disposition: ICU

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of hepatic encephalopathy, infection with resistant organisms, gastrointestinal bleeding, and further volume overload."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents
   after being found down at home with altered mental status and SBP.
   #Fever. Wbc also trending up, 16.4 today. Being treated with
   ceftriaxone for SBP with peritoneal fluid growing pansensitive
   serratia, repeat culture [**6-20**] no growth but positive SBP by cell counts.
   BCx [**6-25**] (anaerobic and aerobic cultures x 1) shows coag neg staph,
   currently being covered with vancomycin. Increased secretions
   yesterday. Fever to 101.8 overnight, pancultured
   - f/u cultures
   - continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin
   - repeat diagnostic para
   - PICC d/c
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely related to ascites and vol overload,
   also with likely aspiration on admission. Improving respiratory
   parameters and more responsive.  RSBI 51 today.
   - likely extubation today
   - continue diuresis c/ lasix bolus tid
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitis c/b SBP, c/b encephalopathy c/b
   portal gastropathy: (A) SBP: on ceftriaxone. (B) ascitis: overall still
   positive fluid balance, with aprx 100 cc/hr on lasix ggt. Problem is
   the high intake level. Will try to consolidate intake. Considering
   adding a second diuretic but furosemide appears effective currently.
   Acetazolamide added for metabolic acidosis. Will touch base with Liver
   re NG tube (in order to maintain po meds) in setting of variceal bleed
   and INR elevation.  (C) Encephalopathy: on lactulose and stable,
   responsive to commands today. (D) Synthetic function: INR and TB
   improving. Transaminitides stable. (E)  Cre stable and still able to
   make ample urine. No evidence of HRS at this time. (F) Varices (grade I
   esophageal varices s/p banding and portal gastropathy): will touch base
   with Liver re nadolol
   # Macrocytic anemia: Likely slow ooze from portal gastropathy. Stools
   guaiac positive. HCT 22.4 from 23 s/p pRBC on [**2140-6-21**]. Curently on
   folate supplementation (h/o EtOH).

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- He has been treated with ceftriaxone for SBP, and peritoneal fluid grew pan-sensitive Serratia. However, subsequent cultures showed no growth but positive SBP by cell counts.
- Blood cultures showed coag-negative staph, which is currently being covered with vancomycin.
- The patient has increased secretions yesterday and fever to 101.8 overnight, with pancultured results pending.
- He is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to ascites and volume overload, as well as likely aspiration on admission.
- His respiratory parameters are improving, and he is more responsive. RSBI is 51 today, indicating a potential for extubation today.
- The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, which could be secondary to SBP, encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy.
- Treatment plans include continuing ceftriaxone and vancomycin, repeating diagnostic paracentesis, and discontinuing the PICC line.
- Diuretics (lasix) have been administered to manage fluid balance, and acetazolamide has been added for metabolic acidosis.
- The patient is on lactulose for encephalopathy, which is stable"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has been treated with ceftriaxone for SBP, as peritoneal fluid showed pan-sensitive serratia. However, his blood culture was positive for coag-neg staph, which is being covered with vancomycin. 

The patient has respiratory failure likely related to ascites and volume overload, with initial signs of aspiration on admission. His respiratory parameters are improving, and he is more responsive today. 

He also has cirrhosis, likely due to alcohol abuse, as evidenced by grade I varices and portal gastropathy seen on endoscopy. 

Additionally, the patient has macrocytic anemia, possibly due to slow bleeding from portal gastropathy. 

The patient is currently on folate supplementation and lactulose to manage these conditions. 

Further plans include continuing lactulose, restarting nadolol for cirrhosis management, and transfusing packed red blood cells for critical levels. 

Other interventions include providing blood products for resuscitation, repleting electrolytes as needed, and initiating tube feeds. 

Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, IV proton pump inhibitor, and lactulose. 

The patient's father is the primary contact person. 

The patient's disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chronic illness, who was admitted to the ICU for fever of unknown origin, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte and fluid disorder, anemia, chronic, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure (not due to ARDS). The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently receiving various medications, including vancomycin, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/57 mmHg to 127/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of jaundice, dry mouth, crackles in the left lung base, a systolic murmur throughout the precordium, markedly distended abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema with signs of chronic venous stasis. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and liver enzymes, as well as low platelet count and albumin level. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, unknown origin. The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte and fluid disorder, chronic anemia, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed can lead to significant blood loss and may result in hypotension and shock.
3. ARDS: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome can worsen and potentially lead to respiratory failure.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy can deteriorate, causing altered mental status and potential complications such as aspiration pneumonia.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte disorder needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications like cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and potential infections.
7. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia can contribute to fatigue and compromised oxygen delivery to tissues.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis presenting after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has been diagnosed with three different infections: SBP (negative for para), coag-negative Staph bacteremia, and likely respiratory failure due to ascites and volume overload. He has alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy. His synthetic function is stable, and he is responding well to lactulose for encephalopathy. He also has macrocytic anemia likely due to slow ooze from portal gastropathy. The patient has been on various medications including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, pantoprazole, and folate supplementation. His vital signs are stable, and he is alert and interactive. The patient's overall condition is improving, with improving respiratory parameters and a positive response to diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has already had three different infections, including SBP, coag-negative Staph bacteremia, and possible respiratory infection. There is a risk of further infections due to his compromised immune system.
2. Liver failure: The patient's presumed EtOH cirrhosis puts him at risk for further liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who presented after being found down at home with altered mental status and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia and is currently on vancomycin. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure likely related to ascites and fluid overload, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, encephalopathy, portal gastropathy, macrocytic anemia, and has had a recent blood transfusion. He is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, lactulose, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and bacteremia, indicating an increased risk of infection. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment is crucial.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory parameters indicate the possibility of respiratory failure due to ascites and fluid overload. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary, and further interventions such as CPAP or mechanical ventilation may be required.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which can be associated with liver dysfunction. Monitoring mental status and treating with lactulose or other medications is important to prevent exacerbation.
4. Variceal bleeding: The patient has grade I esophageal varices, which can lead to bleeding. Regular monitoring and prophylactic measures such as beta-blockers"
