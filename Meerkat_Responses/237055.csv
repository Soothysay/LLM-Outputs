   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory distress
   This patient has multiple reasons for worsened dyspnea, including very
   large pulmonary masses (with possibility of bleeding or edema  from
   radiation), PE, post obstructive pneumonia. Not clear that her PEs were
   extensive  enough to greatly exacerbate dyspnea. Consider also
   aspiration, mucus plugging. Bandemia suggests possible infection,
   ?could be related to her underlying malignancy.
   --Would cover with levofloxacin and flagyl empirically for now. Follow
   up cultures and reculture if febrile.
   --Wean vent as tolerated.
   --Continue outpatient inhalers
   2. Pulmonary emboli
   No anticoagulation per IP due to concern for bleeding of pulmonary
   masses in setting of cyberknife treatment. Hemodynamically stable.
   --Consider IVC filter, as she has little pulmonary reserve to defend
   against further PE
   --SQ heparin okay per attending
   3. Hemoptysis
   Hct slightly decreased from one available prior value in OMR. Has had
   small volumes of hemoptysis since [**11-15**]. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to her
   pulmonary masses or PE. Undergoing bronch by IP today.
   --Type and screen, transfuse Hb<9 or actively bleeding
   4. Metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma
   --Will increase prednisone to 60 daily for short course (e.g. 3 day)
   with taper given wheezing
   --Discuss with oncology in AM
   --Paliative care and social work consults

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma and large pulmonary metastases. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, hemoptysis, and pulmonary emboli. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has an arterial line in place.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/66 mmHg to 92/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.3°C (99.2°F).

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, normal hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, elevated glucose level of 169 mg/dL, and normal platelet count of 270. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function, are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support settings include a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 30. The patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure are both at 16 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 42 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 90%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 215.

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds with wheezes, warm skin, and no peripheral pulses in the extremities. The patient is sedated and not fully responsive.

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's respiratory distress, pulmonary emboli, hemoptysis, and metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma. The patient is being treated with levofloxacin for possible infection, and consideration is being given to weaning off the ventilator as tolerated. The patient is also receiving outpatient inhalers, and her anticoagulation status needs to be addressed due to concern for bleeding from pulmonary masses. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is being considered due to her limited pulmonary reserve. The patient's hemoptysis is being evaluated, and blood products are available for transfusion if necessary.

   or edema  from radiation), PE, and post obstructive pneumonia. Of note,
   her P/F ratio is ~140.
   --continue empiric post-obstructive PNA coverage with levofloxacin and
   flagyl (started [**1-10**]) for now. Follow up cultures.
   -- f/u bronchoscopy cultures
   -- RSBI this AM 73, plan to extubate
   -- Continue outpatient inhalers
   -- continue prednisone 60 daily for 4 day course, no taper needed
   -- concern for ARDS but no bilateral fluffy infiltrates on CXR so far
   f/u this AM
   2. Pulmonary emboli
   Not anticoagulated per IP due to concern for bleeding of pulmonary
   masses in setting of cyberknife treatment (SQ heparin okay)
   -- Continues to be hemodynamically stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She has a history of metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which showed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms seen on gram stain. An IVC filter was placed due to concerns about bleeding from pulmonary masses. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. She is also receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 118/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of dyspnea and hemoptysis, with recent small volumes of hemoptysis. She is alert and communicative but indicates discomfort from the endotracheal tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to very large pulmonary masses causing bleeding or edema from radiation, pulmonary embolism (PE),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism and cancer, specifically gynecological in nature. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy with BAL, which showed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms seen. An IVC filter was also placed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 118/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%.

The patient has received various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. She has a history of cancer and is scheduled for a code status discussion with her primary radiation oncologist next week.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, alertness, symmetric chest expansion, diminished breath sounds at the bases, and diffuse bilateral non-pitting edema. Her neurologic examination is sedated but attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count of 245 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, sodium of 116 mg/dL, potassium of 0.7 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. Imaging findings indicate the ET tube is above the carina and the NG tube tip is in the stomach, with no significant change in bilateral large lung masses.

The patient's assessment includes acute pulmonary embolism, cancer (malignant neoplasm of gynecological origin), wheezing, and history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The plan includes continued ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and further complications related to her underlying cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cervical cancer and large pulmonary metastases who presented to the ICU with shortness of breath. She underwent chemotherapy and cyberknife treatment. Due to oversedation, she was not extubated and her sedation was decreased, resulting in an increase in blood pressure and urine output. The patient's family is aware of her condition, except for her 13 and 15-year-old sons who are currently unaware. A palliative care consult and a social work consultation have been requested. The patient's EKG from 11:30 PM is documented. She denies pain but wants to be taken off the ventilator. There are no known drug allergies. She has been receiving midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, and heparin sodium infusions. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 105/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a history of smoking and is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cervical cancer and large pulmonary metastases who presented to the ICU with shortness of breath. She was not extubated due to oversedation and her sons are unaware of her cancer diagnosis. The patient's vital signs have been stable with an increase in blood pressure from 70/50 to the 90s after IV fluids and decreased sedation. She denies pain but wants to be taken off the ventilator. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode on the ventilator with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL and respiratory system resistance compliance index (RSBI) of 143. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97% on FiO2 of 50%. The patient's blood work shows normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. Her creatinine (Cr) level is within normal range, but her blood glucose levels have been elevated. Other lab results include prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), as well as elevated lactic acid level. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory distress
   DDx includes very large pulmonary masses (with possibility of bleeding
   or edema  from radiation), PE, and post obstructive pneumonia.
   -- RSBI this AM 143, concern that extubation now would lead to need for
   reintubation. Continue on PSV for now weaning as tolerated, reassess in
   afternoon.
   --continue empiric post-obstructive PNA coverage with levofloxacin and
   flagyl (started [**1-10**]). Follow up cultures.
   -- Continue outpatient inhalers though obstruction likely to be mainly
   mass related
   -- Continue prednisone 60 daily for 4 day course given ?radiation
   related edema, no taper needed
   2. Pulmonary emboli
   Not anticoagulated per IP due to concern for bleeding of pulmonary
   masses in setting of cyberknife treatment (SQ heparin okay)
   -- Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   -- s/p IVC filter, appreciate IR involvement
   --Contact IP if hemoptysis returns
   3. Hemoptysis
   Hct ~stable. Has had small volumes of hemoptysis since [**Month (only) 102**]
   [**Month (only) 60**] be related to her pulmonary masses or PE.
   --Type and screen, transfuse HCT <25 or actively bleeding (IP aware)
   4. Metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma
   --appreciate rad onc involvement, plan for family meeting to discuss
   prognosis and code status
   --Paliative care and social work consults pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cervical cancer and large pulmonary metastases who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath. The patient underwent chemotherapy and cyberknife treatment. Due to oversedation, extubation was deferred. The patient's family is aware of her cancer diagnosis, but her 13 and 15-year-old sons are not. A palliative care consult and social work intervention are pending. The patient denies pain but wants to be taken off the ventilator. She has been increasingly hypotensive since 10-11 pm, but responded well to IV fluids and decreased sedation. Her blood pressure has improved to the 90s and better urine output. An EKG was done at 11:30 pm. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode on the ventilator, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 20 cmH2O, RR set at 15, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, RSBI of 143, PIP of 37 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O. Her ABG shows pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 46, PaO2 of 95, and HCO3 of 30. The patient's labs reveal WBC count of 9.4 K/uL, Hct of 34.0%, Plt of 173 K/uL, Cr of 0.8 mg/dL, TCO2 of 28, Glucose of 169 mg/dL, and other results within normal range. The patient's chest X-ray shows no relevant change compared to the previous radiograph, with known multiple nodules and masses caused by metastatic disease. The impression is unchanged radiographic appearance as compared to 1-11, 2132. The patient's medical complications include respiratory distress, pulmonary emboli, hemoptysis, and metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma."

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE - Segmental PE seems unlikely to be a
   major contributor to respiratory failure which is almost certainly due
   to tumor bulk.  Will continue of PSV for now and try again later to
   decrease but it is unclear what we can reverse here.  Plan for
   discussions with social service and palliative care.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient tolerated spontaneous breathing trial poorly with tachypnea and anxiety. The patient has a history of malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer. There is an ongoing concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), but it does not seem to be a major contributor to the respiratory failure. The primary cause of respiratory failure is believed to be tumor bulk. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR (set) of 15, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 54. The ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160, and Ve of 9.6 L/min. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/67 mmHg to 141/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic endotracheal tube, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory distress
   DDx includes very large pulmonary masses (with possibility of bleeding
   or edema  from radiation), PE, and post obstructive pneumonia.
   -- RSBI this AM 57 (143 yesterday), inconcsistency leads to concern
   that extubation now would lead to need for reintubation. Continue on
   PSV for now weaning as tolerated, reassess in afternoon.
   -- check ABG this AM
   --continue empiric post-obstructive PNA coverage with levofloxacin and
   flagyl (started [**1-10**]). Follow up cultures.
   -- Continue outpatient inhalers though obstruction likely to be mainly
   mass related
   -- Continue prednisone 60 daily for 4 day course given ?radiation
   related edema, no taper needed
   2. Pulmonary emboli
   Not anticoagulated per IP due to concern for bleeding of pulmonary
   masses in setting of cyberknife treatment (SQ heparin okay)
   -- Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   -- s/p IVC filter, appreciate IR involvement
   --Contact IP if hemoptysis returns
   3. Hemoptysis
   Hct ~stable. Has had small volumes of hemoptysis since [**Month (only) 102**]
   [**Month (only) 60**] be related to her pulmonary masses or PE.
   -- maintain type and screen
   --  transfuse HCT <25 or actively bleeding (IP aware), so will give 1
   untis PRBCs today
   4. Metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma
   --appreciate rad onc involvement, plan for family meeting to discuss
   prognosis and code status
   --Paliative care and social work consults pending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She has a history of metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma and is currently undergoing cyberknife treatment. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to very large pulmonary masses, which may cause bleeding or edema due to radiation. The patient's RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is 54, indicating potential difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) for now and reassess in the afternoon.

2. Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has not been anticoagulated due to concerns about bleeding from the pulmonary masses during cyberknife treatment. However, she has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, and there is ongoing discussion regarding the need for anticoagulation. The patient is stable hemodynamically, and if hemoptysis returns, the physician will contact the intensivist.

3. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing small volumes of hemoptysis since [Month] [Day]. It is unclear whether this is related to her pulmonary masses or a pulmonary embolism. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels appear stable. A type and screen have been maintained,"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory distress
   DDx includes very large pulmonary masses (with possibility of bleeding
   or edema  from radiation), PE, and post obstructive pneumonia.
   -- RSBI this AM 57 (143 yesterday), but tires easily and still with
   thick and bloody secretions. This is concerning that extubation now
   would lead to need for reintubation. Switch to AC for now
   -- check ABG this PM
   -- continue empiric post-obstructive PNA coverage with levofloxacin and
   flagyl (started [**1-10**]). Follow up cultures (all NGTD). No clinical signs
   of infection (no leukocytosis despite steroids, no fevers)
   -- Continue outpatient albuterol/ipratropium inhalers though
   obstruction likely to be mainly mass related
   -- Continue prednisone 60 daily for 4 day course (end [**1-14**]) given
   ?radiation related edema, no taper needed
   -- serial CXRs
   2. Pulmonary emboli
   Not anticoagulated per IP due to concern for bleeding of pulmonary
   masses in setting of cyberknife treatment (SQ heparin okay)
   -- Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   -- s/p IVC filter, appreciate IR involvement
   -- Contact IP if hemoptysis returns
   3. Hemoptysis
   Hct ~stable. Has had small volumes of hemoptysis since [**Month (only) 102**]
   [**Month (only) 60**] be related to her pulmonary masses or PE.
   -- maintain type and screen
   -- check PM HCT today
   --  transfuse HCT <25 or actively bleeding (IP aware)
   4. Metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma
   --appreciate rad onc involvement, Paliative care and social work

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She is currently intubated in the ICU and has been diagnosed with metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory distress, potential pulmonary emboli, and hemoptysis.

The respiratory distress is likely due to very large pulmonary masses causing bleeding or edema from radiation therapy. The patient's RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) has improved slightly but she still tires easily and has thick and bloody secretions. There are concerns about extubation leading to reintubation.

There is a suspicion of pulmonary emboli (PE), but the patient is not anticoagulated due to concerns about bleeding from the pulmonary masses during cyberknife treatment. An IVC (inferior vena cava) filter has been placed, and the patient is stable hemodynamically.

The patient has been experiencing small volumes of hemoptysis since [Month (only) 102] and [Month (only) 60], which could be related to her pulmonary masses or PE. Type and screen have been maintained, and the patient's hematocrit (Hct) will be checked today. If the Hct is below 25 or if the patient is actively bleeding, transfusion will be considered.

The patient's metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma has been discussed, and rad onc (radiation oncology), palliative care, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient is overweight/obese, has crackles in the chest, and is on mechanical ventilation with SIMV/PSV mode. The vital signs show sinus tachycardia and stable blood pressure. The patient has a history of malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer, for which they are undergoing cyberknife treatment. They also have a pulmonary embolism with an IVC filter in place. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated WBC count, and altered electrolyte levels. They are receiving multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is unable to stand and is sedated. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further pulmonary embolism, infection due to prolonged immobility and invasive lines, and complications related to their underlying malignancy."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes cancer (malignant neoplasm) of gynecological origin (ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial), and there is suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and wheezing.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 112/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on FiO2 60%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 168, and HCO3- of 34 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated WBC count of 200 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, increased sodium level of 144 mg/dL, decreased potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and elevated glucose level of 444 mg/dL. The results of imaging studies reveal multiple pulmonary metastatic masses on chest X-ray. Microbiology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (plateau) of 18 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). She denies pain but complains of needing to blow her nose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a known complication of metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma. The ongoing respiratory support through intubation and mechanical ventilation is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobility due to being bedridden and her underlying malignancy, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a PE. This is a potential complication that should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and remains on mechanical ventilation. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying cancer with pulmonary masses has led to acute respiratory failure. There is a possibility of progression in respiratory failure if the current treatment does not improve her condition.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute PE, and appropriate measures have been taken, including the placement of an IVC filter. However, there is a risk of recurrent hemoptysis due to the bleeding risk associated with the tumor. If hemoptysis returns, contacting a specific physician may be necessary.

3. Wheezing: The patient is experiencing wheezing, which requires supportive care with nebulizers and suctioning as needed. This indicates the possibility of bronchospasm or narrowing of the airways.

4. Infection: Although there is little clinical evidence of infection, the patient is still receiving antibiotics for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen accordingly is important.

5. Malignant Neoplasm: The patient has metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma, and the response to radiation treatment will be determined soon. The patient's cancer may continue to progress and cause further complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is respiratory failure, and the patient is supported with assisted ventilation. The patient also has a history of malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer, and an acute pulmonary embolism with an IVC filter in place. Additionally, there is a mention of supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT) and wheezing.

From the vital signs, the patient has tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 92 to 114 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a slight variation in systolic pressure. Respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is at 98%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 2,027 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,897 mL given intravenously. The patient has also had 945 mL of blood products transfused.

Regarding the lab results, the patient's hemoglobin level is 7.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 200 K/uL, and platelet count is 165 K/uL. Sodium levels are within normal range, but potassium and chloride levels are slightly low. Blood glucose levels are elevated at 444 mg/dL. Other lab values such as creatinine, total CO2, and calcium are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, which is believed to be due to the progression of underlying cancer with pulmonary masses. There may have been a component of pulmonary embolism and/or radiation edema.

The patient has been treated with prednisone for radiation-related pulmonary edema, but it has failed. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is currently on levo and flagyl for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has a fever, and cultures have been taken. The CXR shows progression of parenchymal opacity that could represent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Therefore, levofloxacin has been discontinued, and vancomycin and zosyn have been started. Flagyl has been continued.

The patient's cancer is being managed by radiation oncology and palliative care. The family is considering extubation for the patient on Friday.

The patient also has wheezing, for which supportive care with nebulizers and suctioning as needed is being provided.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition via a nasogastric tube, and her glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, PICC line, and peripheral IV lines. Prophylactic measures such as DVT and VAP proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma and respiratory failure. She has been treated with prednisone for radiation-related pulmonary edema, but it has failed. She remains on current ventilator settings and is aware of the likely respiratory failure after extubation. She is still receiving antibiotics for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has a fever, and urine and sputum cultures have been taken. Her cancer is being managed by radiation oncology, palliative care, and social work. The family has come to visit the patient, and there is consideration for possible Friday extubation. The patient has a history of acute pulmonary embolism, and an IVC filter has been placed. She is not anticoagulated due to bleeding risk from tumor. She is experiencing wheezing, and supportive care with nebulizers and suctioning as needed is being provided. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her recent labs show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, and glucose of 106 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal a moderate left pleural effusion and increased opacification in the right hemithorax, which could be due to pleural effusion, developing pneumonia, or hemorrhage surrounding the large lung masses. Microbiology results show no microorganisms seen on gram stain of sputum sample. The patient has a DNR code status and is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to the progression of her underlying cancer with pulmonary masses. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory function, which could lead to hypoxia and potential need for continued ventilatory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and increased opacification in the right hemithorax on imaging studies, which could indicate the development of pneumonia. This would require appropriate antibiotic treatment and monitoring for improvement.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a moderate left pleural effusion, which can impair lung expansion and function. This may need to be addressed through drainage or other interventions to relieve symptoms and improve respiratory status.
4. Hemorrhage: The increased opacification in the right hemithorax could also be suggestive of hemorrhage surrounding the large lung masses. This could lead to rapid deterioration and respiratory compromise if significant bleeding occurs.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, potential infections (such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection), and immunocompromised state"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of cancer, specifically gynecological malignancies including ovarian, uterine, cervical, and endometrial cancer. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

During the overnight period, the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s, which was likely due to a higher dose of propofol. The patient's fever reached 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, and cultures were obtained from blood, sputum, and urine, as well as a chest X-ray (CXR) performed.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 401 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 87, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate (HR) of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 103/63 to 138/80 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR)"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of malignancy and is currently experiencing fever, wheezing, and poor prognosis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has an increasing right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia. This can be a complication of immunosuppression due to cancer or prolonged ICU stay.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is at risk for further embolic events due to malignancy-related hypercoagulability and lack of anticoagulation.

3. Cancer progression: The patient has advanced malignancy with no improvement after cyberknife treatment. The disease is expected to progress, leading to worsening respiratory failure.

4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and worsening infiltrates suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis, especially considering the patient's compromised immune system.

5. Extubation failure: The plan is for extubation tomorrow, but there is a risk of extubation failure due to the patient's critical illness and respiratory distress.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection parameters, and overall clinical condition to identify and manage any potential complications promptly."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to massive metastatic disease in the lung, superimposed pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a history of gynecological cancer (ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial) with no improvement after cyberknife treatment, indicating a poor prognosis. Additionally, the patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and wheezing, which has been treated with prednisone for bronchospasm.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.1°F (38.4°C), tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, and low blood pressure ranging from 104/67 to 138/80 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits at 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 94% on ventilator support.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 401 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 147 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 5.6 to 8.1 thousand/mm3, slightly low hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 24.6 to 27.2%, and normal platelet count (Plt) ranging from 165 to 173 thousand/mm3. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and glucose levels are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows increasing right lower lobe infiltrate, while other masses remain unchanged. The patient's overall condition is critical, and the healthcare team plans to extubate the patient tomorrow when the family arrives. The patient's worsening infiltrate and fever raise concerns for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia, and therefore, the decision has been made to change antibiotics to vancomycin and zosyn.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, arterial line, PICC line for central venous access, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, as well as daily wake-up and mouth care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. The patient has a history of malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer. There are also mentions of pulmonary embolism (PE) and supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an elevated respiratory rate. The patient is unable to stand due to an unknown reason. The labs indicate elevated levels of glucose, white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, and troponin. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a slightly higher pH, lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and higher partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 99%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility due to respiratory failure may increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system due to malignancy and prolonged ICU stay increases the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma, currently experiencing respiratory failure. She has increased tumor burden in the lung and pulmonary embolism. The patient is intubated and receiving respiratory support. There are concerns about potential metastases, radiation edema, and infection, which are worsening right middle lobe opacity. She has been treated with cyberknife without appreciable response. The patient is also on heparin for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis. Her current medications include lorazepam, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and lansoprazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increasing need for respiratory support suggests worsening respiratory failure. Factors such as metastases, radiation edema, and infection may contribute to this condition. The right middle lobe opacity indicates a possible source of infection or worsening tumor burden.
2. Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Cervix: Despite cyberknife treatment, there has been no appreciable response in the tumor burden. This indicates the possibility of disease progression and further complications related to metastatic cancer.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, for which she is receiving heparin prophylaxis. There is a risk of clot progression or complications associated with anticoagulation therapy.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma and increased tumor burden in the lung. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving respiratory support due to respiratory failure. The possible causes of her respiratory failure include metastases, radiation edema, and infection. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 98% on ventilator support with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 60%. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 86/55 mmHg to 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally and no edema in the lower extremities. Her abdominal examination shows bowel sounds present and no tenderness. The neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient being intubated.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 6.8 to 8.1 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 22.7% to 27.2%, elevated platelet count (Plt) ranging from 173 to 245 thousand/mm3, and elevated blood glucose level of 737 mg/dL.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure.
- She has been intubated due to meaningful interactions with family and the belief that she may require sedation for discomfort in the next few days.
- Antibiotics have been stopped as futile to continue treatment for pneumonia.
- The patient has started on tube feeds per family preference, guaifenesin, and codeine for cough.
- She has had episodes of feeling like she cannot breathe overnight and feels that guaifenesin and codeine are helpful but reluctant to take codeine.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/63 mmHg to 141/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 501 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, and spontaneous tidal volume ranging from 251-525 mL.
- The patient is awake, oriented,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, acute pulmonary embolism, and malignancy in the gynecological area. She is currently admitted to the ICU and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (116 bpm), low blood pressure (99/63 mmHg), and fever (38.1°C). She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient has received blood transfusions and has shown changes in her laboratory values, including elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and recent antibiotic use suggest a possible infection. If the infection spreads and becomes systemic, it could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's low blood pressure and abnormal laboratory values may indicate organ dysfunction, such as renal or hepatic impairment. Monitoring these parameters closely is essential to identify any further deterioration.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and underlying malignancy increase her risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. This can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing pneumonia due to the use of the ventilator. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and sputum culture is necessary to prevent and identify this complication.
5. Bleeding: Heparin sodium is used for anticoagulation, but it increases the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of the patient's coagulation profile is crucial to minimize the risk of hemorrhage.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be necessary to provide a more comprehensive analysis."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer. She has large pulmonary metastases and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The cause of her respiratory failure is extensive pulmonary tumor burden with a possible small pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia.

The patient is no longer receiving antibiotics due to the inability to treat the underlying condition. She is receiving supportive care with continued mechanical ventilation, guaifenesin, and codeine. Albuterol and atrovent are also being given as standing orders. The patient often declines comfort measures because of her desire to avoid sedation. However, it is anticipated that she will eventually require sedation due to breathing tube and dyspnea-related discomfort.

The patient's cancer is not responding to radiation therapy (XRT). Her family and she are aware of the grim prognosis and are making the most of the time they have. They appreciate the input and care provided by Dr. [Last Name (Title)]. Social work and palliative care have assisted the family in coping with the situation.

Nutritionally, the patient's oral-gastric tube has been discontinued after she did not tolerate feeds and vomited. She will be given IV maintenance for now.

In terms of ICU care, the patient has an arterial line inserted on [2133-1-10] and a PICC line inserted on [2133-1-13]. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer, large pulmonary metastases, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure. She has a grim prognosis and is not responding to radiation therapy. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Coughing: The patient coughed, leading to the temporary cessation of tube feeds due to concerns about aspiration. The order for stopping tube feeds was given by the RN, but the family was okay with it.

2. OGT (Oral-Gastric Tube): The OGT was discontinued after the patient did not tolerate feeds and vomited. IV fluids are being given as maintenance.

3. Antibiotics: The patient received vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole. However, antibiotics were discontinued because the underlying condition cannot be effectively treated.

4. Infusions: The patient is receiving lorazepam (Ativan) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of gynecological cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition has been stable with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values over the past few days.
- The patient's respiratory support has been maintained on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- The patient's NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm, indicating proper placement.
- Imaging shows large bilateral masses consistent with metastases, with no evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.
- Microbiology reports show no growth in sputum and urine cultures.
- The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and infection parameters is necessary.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and malignancy increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as anticoagulation should be considered.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's cancer diagnosis and immobilization, there is a risk of PE. Regular assessment of respiratory symptoms and consideration of diagnostic imaging if warranted.
4. Delirium:"

   57 year-old woman with respiratory failure likely secondary to her
   tremendous burden of pulmonary metastatic disease from cervical
   cancer.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   This is a very challenging situation -- we cannot fix the primary
   problem (the cancer).  Her mental status has improved, and she
   tolerated a very brief trial of 5/0. Today, we will try her on a
   spontaneous breathing trial.  If she tolerates it, we will consider
   extubation trial.  If successful, we will need to discuss future
   plans.  If unsuccessful, we will discuss other options.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary metastatic disease from cervical cancer. She has a history of acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/59 to 74/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's recent lab results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 5.1 to 8.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level between 22.7% and 26.6 g/dL, platelet count between 172 and 245 K/uL, creatinine level between 0.5 and 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 106 to 737 mg/dL. Other lab values including electrolytes and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals attentive mental status, purposeful movement, and unassessed peripheral vascular and skin conditions. She has been receiving various medications such as lorazepam, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, consideration of a spontaneous breathing trial, potential extubation trial, and discussion of future plans if successful. She also has a history of malignant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hemoptysis and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/66 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure support of 18 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. She is also receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted respiratory symptoms. Her recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium levels, and decreased calcium levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished and coarse bilateral breath sounds, trace edema in her extremities, and no murmurs or irregularities in her heart sounds. A chest X-ray has been ordered to further evaluate her condition.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has acute respiratory failure due to extensive pulmonary metastases, superimposed pulmonary emboli, and possible radiation edema."

   Critical Care Staff Addendum
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with the
   above note, and would add/emphasize:
   Respiratory Failure due to marked burden of metastatic disease.  There
   is no evidence for infection (and substantial evidence against it at
   this point) and there is no evidence for volume overload.  Ms. [**Known lastname 583**]
   remains effectively stable from a ventilatory standpoint.  We will plan
   a spontaneous breathing trial today.  I suspect that it will be
   unsuccessful.  If so, we will discuss with her family and goals of care
   and her potential options.
   Anemia is stable and is not at transfusion threshold
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**]
s note.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure. She has extensive pulmonary metastases with superimposed pulmonary emboli and possible radiation edema. The respiratory failure is not consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/66 to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 40% FiO2. She is on CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 322 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is awake and sitting in a chair, getting suctioned. Her lungs show diminished and coarse breath sounds throughout. She has no murmurs, and her abdomen is soft with normal tenderness and no distension. There is trace edema in her extremities.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count ranging from 5.1 to 8.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 22.7% to 26.6 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 172 to 245 thousand/mm3, blood glucose"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hemoptysis and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated, blood pressure is on the lower side, respiratory rate is slightly increased, and oxygen saturation is good.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The physical examination reveals that the patient is awake, sitting in a chair, and getting suctioned. The lungs show diminished and coarse breath sounds. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. There is trace edema in the extremities.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. Hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes respiratory failure, acute cancer (malignant neoplasm), gynecological cancer (ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial), acute pulmonary embolism, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's respiratory failure and history of pulmonary embolism indicate a risk of further respiratory issues. The elevated lactate level suggests possible tissue hypoperfusion or poor tissue oxygenation. The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection."

   57yo woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):
   Due to underlying tumor burden with pulmonary emboli and possible
   radiation edema.  Unable to treat PE because of concern for erosion
   into pulmonary artery and s/p treatment for edema with steroids.
   -          failed trial of 5/0, do not expect patient will be extubated
   any time in near future
   -          appreciate assessment for possible trach given respiratory
   failure of irreversible cause in patient who is otherwise functioning
   well
   -          supportive care with inhalers and cough medicines
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
   -          no treatment at present; not responding well to XRT
   -          appreciate input from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 604**]
   -          appreciate assistance from palliative care and social work
   # Tachycardia:
   -          patient has baseline tachycardia that has not been
   responsive to fluids, most likely because of increased afterload and
   increased metabolic demand from tumor
   -          nevertheless, tachycardia appears worse overnight; DDx
   includes dehydration or infection
   -          increase maintenance fluids and give bolus now
   -          if patient spikes fever, would reculture and consider
   restarting antibiotics for possible pneumonia
   # Hypotension:
   -          art line readings have been unreliable given poor tracing
   -          pt continues to mentate well and have good urine output
   -          will remove A-line and follow cuff BP
   -          consider treatment for infection if develops fever or is not
   fluid responsive
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   -          developed acutely since last week
   -          will send HIT antibody and stop all heparin products
   -          not a candidate for anticoagulation given concern that tumor
   may be eroding into pulmonary artery (presented with hemoptysis)

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with respiratory distress, who is currently in the ICU. She has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has undergone a trial of noninvasive ventilation but failed due to dyspnea. The plan is to pursue tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term management. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and elevated respiratory rate. She has coarse breath sounds in her lungs and trace edema in her extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and prolonged clotting times. The patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSI) of 211, indicating a need for further respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. To prevent this, the patient should have her head of bed elevated, mouth care performed regularly, and a daily screen for RSBI (respiratory system bilirubin index) should be done.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with prolonged respiratory failure related to her extensive metastatic burden of pulmonary disease. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of gynecological origin, acute pulmonary embolism, anemia, tachycardia with borderline hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and hypovolemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged respiratory failure indicates a decreased ability to breathe adequately. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function, increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, and potential respiratory arrest.

2. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm): The presence of extensive metastatic burden of pulmonary disease suggests advanced-stage cancer. Complications related to cancer may include tumor growth, spread of cancer to other organs, pain, and difficulty with nutrition.

3. Acute Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. Complications can include further deterioration of lung function, low oxygen levels, chest pain, and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia indicates a decrease in red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels. Complications can include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery"

   We will
   - transfuse (?hypovolemia, hct 22)
   - check cultures
   - treat for possible VAP
   - offer Tylenol
   Additional pulmonary embolism is also in the differential, particularly
   given thrombocytopenia and ? of HIT.  However, we would not

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name], a 57-year-old woman with a history of extensive metastatic pulmonary disease, is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been experiencing prolonged respiratory failure and has been unresponsive to previous treatments. Her vital signs show a fever of 100.8°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 76/55 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. She is intubated on assist-control ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 429 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to her agitation and elevated respiratory rate. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 193 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 77 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -9 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 6.9 mEq/L, and lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of extensive metastatic pulmonary disease, resulting in prolonged respiratory failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Key Findings:
1. The patient's vital signs indicate a low-grade temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate.
2. She has a decreased urine output and requires volume challenges.
3. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly abnormal kidney function.
4. Imaging studies are not provided in the progress note.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged respiratory failure is attributed to her extensive metastatic pulmonary disease. A consultation with Intensive Care Physicians regarding tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is recommended.
2. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Gynecological: No acute intervention is required at present.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE), Acute: Anticoagulation is contraindicated due to the risk of hemorrhage from tumor/PA apposition.
4. Anemia, Other: Follow-up with transfusion if the patient's hemoglobin levels fall further or persist with hypotension.
5. Tachycardia with borderline hypotension: Suspected hypovolemia due to thirst and decrement in urine output. A volume challenge is warranted."

   57yo woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   -          due to huge pulmonary metastases
   -          plan for trach today for palliative support
   -          continue current vent settings
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
   -          no current treatment given poor response to XRT
   -          followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 604**]
   -          appreciate palliative care/social work assistance
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   -          worse yesterday in setting of elevated temp
   -          concerned for infection, most likely VAP in setting of GPC
   on sputum
   -          started vanc, zosyn, cipro (Day 1 = [**1-21**])
   -          also with component of dehydration, anxiety, and agitation
   -          continue supportive care, increase IV fluids, and given
   ativan/haldol if patient accepts
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -          concern for VAP as discussed above, although also suspect
   she is dehydrated
   -          BP currently in 110s
   -          Monitor closely, bolus if needed
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
   -          HIT antibody positive with moderate pre-test probability, so
   suspect HIT is real
   -          No evidence of thrombosis
   -          After discussing with patient, IP, and Onc, plan is to
   proceed with transfusion of platelets so that she can have palliative
   trach and PEG
   -          Hold all heparin products
   -          Discussed with IV team; patient has an HDC PICC; this is NOT
   heparin-coated
   -          Not a candidate for argatroban because of high bleeding risk
   from pulmonary metastases
   # ARF:
   -          in setting of fevers, tachycardia
   -          aggressive fluids
   -          repeat PM lytes
   -          renal ultrasound to check for obstruction
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE:
   -          as above, no anticoagulation given high bleeding risk
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   -          s/p transfusion with RBCs [**1-21**] with appropriate increment in
   Hct

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU for palliative care. The patient's recent events include an arterial line stop, blood cultures taken, EKG, sputum culture, and urine culture. She experienced tachycardia in the afternoon, which was initially attributed to anxiety and dehydration but later suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient received empiric treatment for VAP with vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 100.8°F and borderline urine output of approximately 460 cc for the day. She has oliguria, which is decreased urine output. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds in the lungs and warm extremities. Her mental status is described as awake, comfortable, and breathing easily.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, elevated glucose level of 126 mg/dL, and normal potassium levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT/INR of 14.3 and PTT of 35.7, suggesting a bleeding risk. The patient tested positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which led to the decision to hold all heparin products and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of gynecological cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been experiencing tachycardia, fever, and worsening oxygenation despite being on mechanical ventilation. The patient's urine output is borderline, and she has been receiving empiric antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There are concerns about potential complications such as thrombocytopenia, acute pulmonary embolism, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is showing signs of infection, including fever and worsening oxygenation while on mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture revealed the presence of 2+ GPC in pairs and clusters, which suggests a bacterial infection. Empiric antibiotics have been started, but further evaluation and treatment may be required.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk for bleeding complications. Monitoring of platelet levels and close observation for signs of bleeding are necessary.
3. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobility and cancer history, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the lungs. Symptoms such as sudden onset tachycardia and hypoxia could indicate a possible PE. Imaging studies like a CT pulmonary angiogram may be required for diagnosis and appropriate management.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with respiratory failure secondary to metastatic disease. She is currently experiencing thrombocytopenia, probable heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), oliguria, and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer, and is not receiving acute intervention for it. The patient also has tachycardia and a history of pulmonary embolism. She has been transfused with blood products and is at risk of increased bleeding due to her pulmonary condition. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in her ability to breathe independently.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially if she requires any invasive procedures or surgeries.
3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's probable HIT increases the risk of blood clots forming in her blood vessels, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism or stroke.
4. Oliguria: The patient's reduced urine output suggests acute renal failure. If left untreated, this can progress to chronic renal failure and lead to complications like electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure. She underwent a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) insertion and tracheostomy placement. The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia with a blood pressure in the 200s, which improved with ativan. She is febrile at 103 degrees Fahrenheit and cultures have been taken. The patient also complains of trach and PEG soreness, especially with coughing.

The patient has allergies to heparin agents and is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She is being infused with fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and lorazepam (Ativan). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/58 mmHg to 241/215 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her weight has increased from 91.5 kg at admission to 97.1 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total intake of 6,885 mL with 912 mL given in the past 24 hours. The total output is 540 mL of urine and 250 mL of NG (nasogastric) output. The patient's respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical carcinoma and respiratory failure. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, fevers, and mild left hydronephrosis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and Foley catheter insertion. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C) and a current temperature of 99.6°F (37.6°C). Her heart rate is elevated at 103 beats per minute (bpm), with a blood pressure of 89/59 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 54 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The sputum culture reveals gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, while the respiratory culture shows moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora. 

Imaging studies, including a renal ultrasound, show mild left hydronephrosis without any focal mass lesions or calculi identified.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure secondary to metastatic cervical cancer. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient remains persistently febrile, with a temperature of 101.6°F, and has been treated with antibiotics. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66-73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 95 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 109-748 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, low fibrinogen level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to metastatic cervical cancer. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). If the patient's chest x-ray remains negative tomorrow, antibiotics will be discontinued.
2. Cancer: The patient has malignant neoplasm of the cervix and is not actively being treated. She has undergone radiation therapy.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is of unclear origin and is being treated as presumed VAP. It could also be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) due to the high propensity.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased but is now stable at 1.1 mg/dL. This could be due to poor forward flow during hypotension.
5. HIT: The patient is positive for HIT and requires alternative anticoagulation.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated but stable and improves with sleeping. IV fluids will be given as needed.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low but stable. Concern for evolving sepsis. Improved with antibiotics and IV fluids.
8. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is not anticoagulated as there is erosion into the pulmonary artery.
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to malignancy.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Start tube feeding (TF)
- Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale, well-controlled blood sugar
- Lines: PICC Line inserted on 1/13/20
- Prophylaxis: DVT prevention (boots refused), stress ulcer prophylaxis (PPI), VAP prevention (HOB elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, RSBI)

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she will continue in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o F with respiratory failure secondary to metastatic cervical
   cancer, now s/p trach and doing well but persistently febrile.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): [**1-10**] mets, with possible
   superimposed VAP.  Still febrile, cx negative to date.  If cx remain
   negative tomorrow (72 hours) would d/c antibiotics.  PSV weaned, will
   cont this.  Can try trach mask trials although highly doubt she will
   tolerate.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL):  Not actively treating.  S/p XRT.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):  Unclear
   source, treating as presumed VAP.  Also could be due to clot given high
   propensity (HIT positive).
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Creatinine increased
   and now stable but high at 1.1.  UOP improved yesterday.  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to
   poor forward flow during hypotension.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER:  Stable.  Improves with sleeping.  Will give IVF
   prn to see if it improves.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  As above, stable.  Concern for evolving
   sepsis.  Seems to have improved with antibiotics and IVF.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE:  Not anticoagulated as met eroding
   into PA.
 ANEMIA, OTHER:  Hct stable, no signs of active bleeding.  Likely due
   to malignancy.

   -          sputum Cx only with oropharyngeal flora, all other cx
   negative
   -          foley has been d/c
   -          on vanc/zosyn/cipro (day 1 = [**1-21**]) for possible VAP
   -          would stop antibiotics today
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):
   -          occurred in setting of new fevers, tachycardia, hypotension,
   so most likely prerenal
   -          urine output is fine
   -          renal US with mild L hydro despite foley in place; could
   have obstruction from tumor, though mild u/l hydro unlikely to cause
   significant renal impairment
   -          monitor urine output and Cr
 Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia
   -          no evidence of thrombosis
   -          platelets stable after stopping heparin
   -          not a candidate for argatroban b/c of bleeding risk from
   pulmonary metastases
   -          pt agrees to wear pneumoboots
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   -          less frequent episodes of tachycardia, most likely b/c she
   appears to be more comfortable with trach

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of malignancy in the gynecological region, presenting with acute respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia, fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 560 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR spontaneous of 27, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 21 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 99%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 99/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator.

The patient has a history of malignancy, and her labs show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Other notable findings include a prolonged PT/PTT/INR, elevated lactic acid level, low calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

   -          sputum Cx only with oropharyngeal flora, all other cx
   negative, foley has been d/c
   -          on vanc/zosyn/cipro (day 1 = [**1-21**]) for possible VAP
   -          would stop antibiotics today
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):
   -          occurred in setting of new fevers, tachycardia, hypotension,
   so most likely prerenal
   -          urine output is fine
   -          renal US showed mild L hydro despite foley; could have
   obstruction from tumor, though mild unilateral hydro unlikely to cause
   significant renal impairment
   -          trend urine output and Cr daily
 Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia
   -          no evidence of thrombosis, platelets remain stable after
   stopping heparin
   -          not a candidate for argatroban b/c of bleeding risk from
   pulmonary metastases
   -          pt agrees to wear pneumoboots
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   -          less frequent episodes of tachycardia, most likely b/c she
   appears to be more comfortable with trach
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   -          no anticoagulation given bleeding risk

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical carcinoma and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU. The patient experienced chest pain at 06:41 AM, which was mainly present with breathing/movement and had no associated nausea, lightheadedness, or worsened shortness of breath. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, and she was given oxycodone with good relief. 

The patient has allergies to heparin agents. She received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), as part of her treatment for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Her vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate: 102 bpm (range: 93-112 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 99/52 mmHg (64/52 mmHg during the past 24 hours)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (range: 15-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is currently receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with a tidal volume of 560 mL (range: 240-560 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure secondary to her metastatic disease. She has potentially superimposed pneumonia and pulmonary embolisms. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume of 15 mL/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%.

24-hour events include chest pain that resolved with oxycodone and an episode of sinus tachycardia. The patient has allergies to heparin agents and received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) within the past 24 hours.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 89/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 91.5 kg at admission to 97.1 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,169 mL and output of 1,825 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,344 mL since midnight. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, Vt of 590 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman admitted with respiratory failure and hemoptysis due to metastatic cervical cancer.
- She has been experiencing fever, which is now resolving and antibiotics have been stopped as cultures were negative.
- The patient has acute renal failure, with improving urine output and mild hydronephrosis noted on renal ultrasound. This is suspected to be caused by the primary tumor but currently with preserved renal function.
- The patient has been diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is not a candidate for argatroban. Her platelet count is improving after holding heparin.
- The patient has a history of tachycardia, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism, but these conditions are currently stable.
- The patient also has leukopenia, which is suspected to be secondary to infection that caused fevers and acute renal failure.
- The patient has bilateral leg edema, for which gentle diuresis is being used as tolerated by blood pressure.
- The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored and managed accordingly.
- The patient has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is expected to be transferred to NY for further treatment.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and hemoptysis. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently on pressure support for subjective air hunger, with oxygen saturation levels remaining stable. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and has been experiencing swelling in both legs.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate within normal limits, stable blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Her temperature is within normal range, but there is a noted increase in maximum temperature recorded at 37.6°C. The patient's weight has increased from 91.5 kg at admission to 97.1 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,646 mL and output of 1,400 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving various medications through IV infusions, including antibiotics that were discontinued due to no growth in cultures. Other medications include unknown ICU medications and other prescribed medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse bronchial sounds with diminished sound at the bases, clean PEG site, and soft abdomen with bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function with increased creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of malignancy, immobilization, and lower extremity ed"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure secondary to metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently tolerating tracheostomy trials and is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 97/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.9 thousand/mm3 and a hematocrit level of 22.3%. The platelet count is also low at 80 thousand/mm3. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels and liver function tests.

The patient has a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, possibly due to metastatic disease. She has a history of malignant neoplasm of the cervix and is not currently being treated for it. The patient previously had a fever, which resolved after receiving antibiotics for 24 hours. She also has left lower extremity edema, likely due to total body volume overload and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The plan is to try low-d"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure secondary to metastatic cervical cancer. The patient has shown improvement and is tolerating tracheostomy collar trials. She has a history of malignancy but is not currently undergoing treatment for it. The patient previously experienced a fever, which has resolved after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. She also has left lower extremity edema, which is likely due to total body volume overload and an inferior vena cava filter. The patient's acute renal failure is improving, and leukopenia is trending down but unclear in cause. Hyponatremia is likely due to hypervolemia, and the patient will attempt gentle diuresis. There is a mention of a potential problem with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is improving with discontinuation of heparin. Other issues include improving tachycardia, hypotension responding to volume, acute pulmonary embolism, anemia likely due to lab draws, and stable anemia. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with respiratory failure due to metastatic cervical cancer. She has a history of acute renal failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), tachycardia, leukopenia, and leg edema. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with lasix for fluid management, antibiotics for infection, and receiving tube feeding through a PEG tube. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are currently stable, but she requires close monitoring. The patient's platelet counts are recovering, and she is not a candidate for argatroban. The patient's family is planning to pursue chemotherapy at NY Presbyterian Hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she experiences further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or a worsening of her underlying cancer.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress if there is inadequate fluid management or if the underlying cause of the renal failure worsens.
3. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): Although the patient's platelet counts are recovering, there is still a risk of thrombosis due to HIT. Close monitoring for signs of clot formation is necessary.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen if she experiences fluid shifts or electrolyte imbalances.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o F with respiratory failure [**1-10**] metastatic cervical cancer and
   superimposed pna/PE.  Today, her CXR shows a new pneumothorax with some
   tension.
 TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX.  She is tachycardic; she is borderline
   hypotense. This is definitely a setback and may represent either a
   fistula caused by the tumor, or a result of coughing.  We have
   discussed the issue with her and her husband and will consult
   interventional pulmonary for the possibility of a small-bore chest
   tube.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  As above, felt [**1-10**]
   metastatic cervical cancer.  Superimposed pneumonia initially, s/p
   treatment.  Has improved significantly but still unable to wean from
   the ventilator.  Likely a component of respiratory muscle weakness.
   - weaning on hold until pneumothorax issue resolved
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL):  Not actively being treated.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure due to metastatic cervical cancer and superimposed pneumonia/PE. The patient has shown improvement but is still unable to be weaned off the ventilator, likely due to respiratory muscle weakness. The patient has a new tension pneumothorax, which may be caused by a fistula from the tumor or coughing. Interventional pulmonary consultation has been requested for a small-bore chest tube.

Other medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 1.0, indicating no acute renal failure at the moment. However, close monitoring is required.

2. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count has been trending downwards, of unclear etiology. This may indicate an underlying infection or immune suppression.

3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's platelet count is rising after discontinuing heparin and switching to a non-heparin-coated PICC line.

4. Anemia: The patient has a slightly low hemoglobin level but no clinical signs of bleeding. It is likely dilutional with frequent lab draws. No indication for transfusion is present.

5. Fever: The patient previously had a fever, but it has resolved. Discontinued antibiotics were negative, indicating no ongoing infection.

6. Cancer: The patient has metastatic cervical cancer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure due to metastatic cervical cancer and superimposed pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 94/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has been receiving various medications including lasix, heparin, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may be due to her underlying metastatic cervical cancer and superimposed pneumonia. Continued support with mechanical ventilation may be required until her respiratory function improves.
2. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has a history of heparin exposure and is showing signs of thrombocytopenia. This could lead to an increased risk of bleeding or thrombotic events. Alternative anticoagulation strategies may be necessary.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is trending downwards, which can be indicative of an evolving sepsis or another underlying condition. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Leg Edema: The patient has leg edema, which could be related to her prolonged immobilization and fluid management. Diuretics such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure.
- She was found to have a tension pneumothorax yesterday, which was treated with chest tube placement and pigtail catheter insertion.
- The pneumothorax is likely due to cough or a fistula created by the cancer.
- The patient also has acute respiratory failure due to extensive tumor burden.
- She has been intubated and received tracheostomy.
- There is evidence of leukopenia, which is improving.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, but they have resolved after chest tube placement.
- She has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but her platelets are improving since holding heparin.
- The patient's tachycardia has improved after chest tube placement.
- She has acute pulmonary embolism, but systemic anticoagulation is not indicated due to concern for tumor eroding into PA.
- The patient has anemia, but no indication to transfuse.
- She has bilateral lower extremity edema, possibly due to volume overload or IVC obstruction.
- The plan is to continue ICU care until the pneumothorax resolves, then transfer to NY Presbyterian for further chemotherapy.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU due to tension pneumothorax and had a pigtail catheter placed at bedside. Her allergies include Heparin agents. She has been receiving various antibiotics since admission. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and hypotension. Fluid balance reveals a total input of 2,005 mL and a total output of 1,115 mL. Respiratory support includes ventilation mode CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated glucose levels. Her blood cultures were taken on 2133-1-27 at 10:59 AM and 12:45 PM. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) in the gynecological area (ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's low platelet count and history of heparin use"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, and has had a chest tube and pigtail catheter placed. The tension pneumothorax was likely caused by coughing or a fistula created by previous treatment. The patient also has acute respiratory failure due to an extensive tumor burden and has undergone tracheostomy placement. She has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and is planned for transfer to NY Presbyterian for further chemotherapy once the pneumothorax resolves. She also has leukopenia, improved after chest tube placement, tachycardia, and a past medical history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently on ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient already has a tension pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen due to the extensive tumor burden.
3. Infection: The patient's leukopenia indicates a weakened immune system, making her more susceptible to infections.
4. Heparin-Induced Thromb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with respiratory failure secondary to a large burden of metastatic cervical cancer. She has developed a pneumothorax, for which a chest tube was placed. Her respiratory status has improved after the chest tube placement. She also has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient has a history of malignant neoplasm of the gynecological system, specifically cervical cancer. She has been diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, and anemia. She is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is being dispositioned to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient's large burden of metastatic disease may contribute to the development of pneumothorax. This can be a potentially life-threatening condition if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can be a direct result of her underlying malignancy and compromised respiratory function.
3. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has been diagnosed with HIT, a serious complication of heparin therapy characterized by low platelet counts. This can increase the risk of bleeding and clot"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent tracheostomy placement and chest tube insertion due to an acute pneumothorax. The chest tube was clamped, and the patient's lung remains expanded on a recent chest X-ray. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 84/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 501 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 25 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 85 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%. Physical examination reveals crackles throughout the lungs, decreased breath sounds at the left base, and mild lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, platelet count of 292 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer.
- The patient has undergone chest tube placement, which has led to an improvement in their condition.
- The patient has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 84/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.
- The patient has a pneumothorax, but it is not hospital-acquired or traumatic.
- The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The presence of a pneumothorax increases the risk of complications such as worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potentially tension pneumothorax if the air continues to accumulate.
2. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's low platelet count could be due to HIT, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin therapy. This condition increases the risk of thrombosis and bleeding.
3. Infection: With a compromised immune system due to leukopenia and ongoing medical interventions, the patient is at higher"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic cervical cancer and extensive lung disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure after undergoing tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently on a soft diet and using a Passy-Muir valve. There are concerns about the utility of further chemotherapy, which will be discussed by the oncology team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a need to closely monitor her respiratory status. Tracheostomy placement and the use of a Passy-Muir valve may help improve her respiratory function.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small loculated left apical pneumothorax, possibly communicating with a tumor mass. This condition is unlikely to resolve on its own. Further intervention, such as chest tube placement, may be necessary.
3. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient had resolved thrombocytopenia and is now on a platelet count of 400's. It is important to avoid heparin products and closely monitor for any signs of bleeding due to tumor proximity to the pulmonary artery.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has improved but remains elevated. Close monitoring is required, and potential causes like PTX, anemia, or pulmonary embolism should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with leukemia and is currently undergoing treatment in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a respiratory rate within normal limits. She is receiving supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation support. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, and her medical history includes pneumonia, pneumothorax, and malignancy. She is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mechanical ventilation support is inadequate or if there are any complications related to the chest tube placement.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of pneumothorax, and there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the condition if proper chest tube management is not maintained.
3. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, which increases the risk of developing HIT. Monitoring of platelet count and considering alternative anticoagulation methods may be necessary.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's malignancy and immobilization in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots, including PE. Surveillance for signs and symptoms of PE and consideration of proph"

   trach placement.
   1.  Respiratory Failure  S/p trach placement, using passy muir valve,
   able to tolerate trach for 3 hours at a time and tolerating soft diet
   2.  Metastatic Cervical Cancer
   -oncology team will give final recommendation regarding utility of
   chemo, appreciate input
   -possible plan for chemotherapy at NY Presbyterian
   3.  Pneumothorax:  CT showed small PTX possibly communicating with L
   tumor mass, which has air in it. Unlikely to resolve on its own.
   -appreciate IP input
   -pig tail in left chest, currently clamped
   -continues to have small PTX on CXR
   4.  Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  Thrombocytopenia resolved, plts
   in 400's
   -holding all heparin products, no systemic anticoagulation given risk
   of bleeding due to tumor proximity to pulmonary artery
   -no evidence of thrombosis on exam
   5.  Tachycardia:  Improved overnight in 110's, initially due to PTX
   -continue to monitor, baseline in 110's
   -if concern for increase, would consider enlargement of PTX or anemia
   as discussed below
   6.  Pulmonary Embolism
   -not a candidate for therapeutic anticoagulation give tumor proximity
   to pulmonary artery
   7.  Anemia: at 21.7 today, stable
   -no acute need for transfusion at this time
   -if tachycardia increases, wold consider anemia or bleed in the
   differential given proximity of tumor to PA as above.
   8.  Leukopenia:  Resolving at 3.5 today
   -continue to monitor
   9.  LE Edema: Persistent, likely [**1-10**] IVC filter or tumor compression or
   volume overload
   -bp's in 90-100
   -patient unable to tolerate leg elevation as causes SOB
   -will give Lasix 10mg po as trial for diuresis with goal to improve leg
   pain, if bp's tolerate, would continue

   Ms. [**Known lastname 583**] was seen and examined with the ICU team.  The note above, by
   E. [**Doctor Last Name **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], reflects my input.  I would
   add/emphasize:
   1)       Ms. [**Known lastname 583**] did very well with speech and swallow evaluation
   and was in fact able to come off the ventilator while on a PMV.  She is
   eating small amounts of food for pleasure.  She was back on the
   ventilator overnight and off again this morning.
   2)       Her pneumothorax recurred while chest tube was clamped.  We
   have returned it to suction and asked IP to further evaluate since
   there is some subcutaneous emphysema, as well.
   3)       We have asked oncology to comment on whether they believe
   further systemic therapy would be of benefit.  Their report is that
   conventional therapy would be inappropriate; they will ask the Phase I
   trial group to assess.
   4)       I discussed these issues in detail with Ms. [**Known lastname 583**], her
   husband, and her sister.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic cervical cancer and extensive lung disease who is currently in the ICU. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is using a Passy-Muir valve. The patient is awake and interactive but has respiratory failure, a pneumothorax, and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Her platelet count has recovered after being affected by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's tachycardia has improved, but she still has anemia and leukopenia. She also has lower extremity edema, which may be due to an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, tumor compression, or volume overload. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she will remain in the ICU until her pneumothorax is resolved. There are plans for possible transfer to New York Presbyterian for further treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the pneumothorax is not adequately managed or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumothorax: The small loculated left apical pneumothorax may persist or worsen if not properly treated, potentially leading to further respiratory compromise.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's history of cancer and immobilization, there is a risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, especially"

   - plan for chemotherapy at NY Presbyterian
   - will transfer on Tuesday,  CM aware
   - radiology notified to prepare CD with her imaging on it
   2.  Respiratory Failure - due to pulmonary mets
   - S/p trach placement, using passy muir valve, able to tolerate trach
   collar for increasing amounts of time and tolerating soft diet
   3.  Pneumothorax
   - CT showed small PTX possibly communicating with L tumor mass, which
   has air in it. Unlikely to resolve on its own.
   - PTX appears resolved on CXR this AM
   -given that she will be transferred on Tuesday, no sense in clamping
   chest tube, will allow continued suction and time for re-expansion
   4.  Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  Thrombocytopenia resolved, plts
   in 400's
   -holding all heparin products, no systemic anticoagulation given risk
   of bleeding due to tumor proximity to pulmonary artery
   -no evidence of thrombosis on exam
   - using fonduparinux for DVT ppx
   5.  Tachycardia:  Improved, now in 100's
   -continue to monitor, baseline in 110's
   6.  Pulmonary Embolism
   -not a candidate for therapeutic anticoagulation give tumor proximity
   to pulmonary artery
   7.  Anemia: at 23.7 today, stable
   -no acute need for transfusion at this time
   -if tachycardia increases, wold consider anemia or bleed in the
   differential given proximity of tumor to PA as above.
   8.  Leukopenia:  stable today
   -continue to monitor
   9.  LE Edema: Persistent, likely [**1-10**] IVC filter or tumor compression or
   volume overload
   -bp's in 90-100, lasix  dosing would essentially be cosmetic and may
   drop her BP, cause more harm than good, so will defer any further

   chemo, appreciate input
   -possible plan for chemotherapy at NY Presbyterian
   3.  Pneumothorax:  CT showed small PTX possibly communicating with L
   tumor mass, which has air in it. Unlikely to resolve on its own.
   -appreciate IP input
   -pig tail in left chest, currently clamped
   -continues to have small PTX on CXR
   4.  Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  Thrombocytopenia resolved, plts
   in 400's
   -holding all heparin products, no systemic anticoagulation given risk
   of bleeding due to tumor proximity to pulmonary artery
   -no evidence of thrombosis on exam
   5.  Tachycardia:  Improved overnight in 110's, initially due to PTX
   -continue to monitor, baseline in 110's
   -if concern for increase, would consider enlargement of PTX or anemia

   -not a candidate for therapeutic anticoagulation give tumor proximity
   to pulmonary artery
   7.  Anemia: at 21.7 today, stable
   -no acute need for transfusion at this time
   -if tachycardia increases, wold consider anemia or bleed in the
   differential given proximity of tumor to PA as above.
   8.  Leukopenia:  Resolving at 3.5 today
   -continue to monitor
   9.  LE Edema: Persistent, likely [**1-10**] IVC filter or tumor compression or
   volume overload
   -bp's in 90-100
   -patient unable to tolerate leg elevation as causes SOB
   -will give Lasix 10mg po as trial for diuresis with goal to improve leg

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic cervical cancer and extensive lung disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure after tracheostomy placement. She also has a pneumothorax, which is communicating with a tumor mass, and has been managed with a pigtail catheter. The patient was diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), resulting in a low platelet count. This has led to the discontinuation of all heparin products due to the risk of bleeding. The patient is currently on a soft diet and tolerating tracheostomy well. Other medical conditions include tachycardia, pulmonary embolism, anemia, leukopenia, and lower extremity edema. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient's pneumothorax may worsen or fail to improve despite the pigtail catheter in place. Close monitoring and further interventions may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the patient is not a candidate for therapeutic anticoagulation, there is still a risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism due to the underlying cancer. Monitoring for symptoms and signs of a new embolism is important.
3. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): Although the platelet count has improved, there is still"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic cervical cancer and extensive pulmonary metastasis. She has a history of unknown heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and is currently on fondaparinux for anticoagulation. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is on supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube. She is also on a passy-muir valve but is not weaning off mechanical ventilation. The patient's leukocyte count is low, and she is stable. She has a history of malignancy, including ovarian, uterine, cervical, and endometrial cancers, and will be transferred for salvage chemotherapy. The patient experienced a pneumothorax, which has been managed with chest tube placement. She has anemia but is stable. The patient also has a history of tachycardia, which improved after chest tube placement. She was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism and is on fondaparinux. The patient has been critically ill and has a do-not-resuscitate order in place."

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of gynecological cancer and is currently experiencing leukopenia, tachycardia, and pneumonia. The patient also has a pneumothorax, which was treated with chest tube placement. There are concerns regarding the function or placement of the left pleural catheter, as subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is present. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/64 mmHg to 108/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated creatinine and glucose levels. Imaging shows a left basal pneumothorax that is smaller, along with atelectasis at the left base and a small pleural effusion. The large lung masses on the right obscure mediastinal detail and contribute to left lower lobe atelectasis. The tracheostomy tube is in standard placement, and the left PIC catheter tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute cancer, and other conditions. The plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she will be transferred to NY Presbyterian this week."

   volumes are lower and there is more atelectasis at the left base and th
   ere may
   be a small pleural effusion.  The left pigtail catheter is unchanged in
   position.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall persists.  Lar
   ge lung
   masses obscure detail of the mediastinum, and probably contributes to l

   lower lobe atelectasis.  Aside from the large masses on the right, that
    lung
   is essentially clear.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Tip of
    the
   left PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
   Subcutaneous emphysema in the left neck and chest wall is stable since

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer and respiratory failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), a heart rate of 106 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 93/58 mmHg to 108/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 50%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight-obese appearance, normal pupils, clear breath sounds, and warm skin with subcutaneous emphysema. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, space, and person, and demonstrates purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hemoglobin level at 7.0 g/dL, elevated platelet count ranging from 82 to 402 thousand/mm3, normal kidney function with serum creatinine levels between 0.8-1.1 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 85-715 mg/dL. Other lab values including electrolytes and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Pt p/w resp failure [**1-10**]
   extensive bilateral pulm metastases, PEs and likely obstructive PNA.
   -Resp status now stabilized s/p trach, pt tolerating well and
   maintaining sats with 70% FiO2
   -Pt noted to have bilateral PEs on adm, pt not a candidate for systemic
   anti-coag due to metastases abutting pulm artery and high risk for
   tumor hemorrhage.  Developped HITs to prophylactic Heparin, now on
   Fondaparinux
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL):
   - extensive disease and bilateral pulm mets, pt wanting additional
   chemo, case management assisting with plan for transfer of care to NY
   Presbyterian tomorrow.
 PNEUMOTHORAX, OTHER (NOT HOSPITAL ACQUIRED OR TRAUMATIC):
   -Left apical PTX and subcutaneous emphysema still present of CXR today,
   likely due to tumor creating fistulous tract.
   -Left Chest tube placed to suction, will d/w IP re possibility for
   clamping prior to transfer
HEM/ONC :
   Pt developed Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia on heparin sc ppx, now on
   Fondaparinux
   -plts at 381, Fibrinogen > 600, all coags stabilized, no evidence of
   new thrombosis
   -avoid all heparin products
 TACHYCARDIA: did not respond to volume or blood products, thought
   likely [**1-10**] PTX
   - Improved after chest tube placement, stable at 100-110s.  Avoid IVF
   due to massive extravasc vol overload.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE:
   - not a candidate for systemic anti-coag due to high risk of bleeding.
 ANEMIA
   - compensated & stable at 23, tachycardia did not respond to blood
   products, monitoring hct daily
Leukopenia: stable, not neutropenic, continue to monitor
Lower extremity edema: due to volume overload & possible clot in IVC

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 112 kg overweight/obese female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of constipation. The patient has a history of malignancy, specifically gynecological cancer. She is currently receiving various medications, including lansoprazole, fondaparinux, senna, colace, bisacodyl, lactulose, and oxycodone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 107 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 101/69 to 116/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 91.5 kg at admission to 112 kg currently.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy tube with standby ventilation mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 276 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Her white blood cell count ranges from 3.0 to 4.6 K/uL, hemoglobin levels range from 7"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic cervical cancer and extensive lung involvement. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure from pulmonary embolisms (PEs), complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and left pneumothorax with bronchopleural fistula (BPF). The patient has undergone tracheostomy (trach) placement.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's vital signs have been relatively stable. Her temperature is 36.6°C, blood pressure ranges from 107/69 to 116/69 mmHg, heart rate is 108 bpm, respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 91.5 kg at admission to 112 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,921 mL total fluids, including 940 mL of oral intake, 456 mL of intravenous fluids, and 204 mL of blood products. The total output is 460 mL of urine and 320 mL of drains, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,461 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask, with a standby ventilator mode. Her tidal volume (Vt) is 276 mL, respiratory rate (RR) is 0 breaths per minute (spontaneous), positive end-expiratory pressure ("

","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure secondary to multiple pulmonary metastases and pneumothorax. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and is planned for transfer today to another hospital for palliative chemotherapy. The patient also has a recurrent pneumothorax that has not re-expanded despite chest tube placement. There are potential complications associated with this condition, including bronchopleural fistulae due to necrosis of lung masses, which could lead to persistent air leak and recurrent pneumothorax. Additionally, the patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and is on low-dose fondaparinux. The patient's tachycardia has improved after chest tube placement. Other issues include acute pulmonary embolism, anemia, and a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status. The patient will be transferred to another facility."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Secondary to multiple
   pulmonary metastases, pneumothorax. Doing well on trach mask.
   - Continue trach mask with PMV
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL): Plan is for transfer today to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 918**]
   Hospital, where she will receive palliative chemotherapy.
 PNEUMOTHORAX, OTHER (NOT HOSPITAL ACQUIRED OR TRAUMATIC): Stable on
   water seal. She has necrosis of several of her lung masses which likely
   have created bronchopleural fistulae.  Previously recurred after
   clamping chest tube.
   - Continue on water seal for now. Will need to have trial of tube
   clamping after transfer.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, secondary to multiple pulmonary metastases and pneumothorax.
- The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with positive airway pressure and has been stable.
- There is a history of cancer, specifically gynecological malignancies such as ovarian, uterine, cervical, and endometrial cancer.
- The patient is planned for transfer to another hospital for palliative chemotherapy.
- The patient also has a history of recurrent pneumothorax, which has not responded to previous treatments.
- The patient is on low-dose fondaparinux due to Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- The patient has anemia but it is stable.
- Other medical issues include acute pulmonary embolism, tachycardia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary condition is respiratory failure due to multiple pulmonary metastases and pneumothorax. Complications can arise if the respiratory support is inadequate or if there is a worsening of the underlying conditions.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumothorax, which may complicate further if not managed properly. Re-expansion of the collapsed lung and prevention of future occurrences are crucial.

3. Cancer Progression: The patient's gynecological malignancies may progress despite palliative chemotherapy, leading"
