   <I>## Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:</I> Pt mildly
   encephalopathic but without asterixis (Grade I hepatic encephalopthy).
   Ddx of her acute hepatitis is broad and includes viral etiology,
   toxins, vascular or, less likely, autoimmune. Nuva-ring likely slightly
   increases her risk of B-C syndrome, but her patent vessels on the OSH
   U/S with Dopplers argues strongly against a vascular cause of her
   hepatitis. She has not had any significant trauma or blood loss to
   suggest shock liver, although she did have what sounds like profound
   vomiting and diarrhea that could have led to significant volume
   depletion. Her ingestion of acetaminophen (2 grams per day, 14 grams
   over a period of a week by my calculation) does not seem to be enough
   to have caused such profound hepatitis. Likewise, her EtOH ingestion
   has been mild over the past week ([**3-26**] total drinks). I suppose the
   combination of the two could have been enough, though. Acute viral
   hepatitis (both A, which is more common, and B, which is a more common
   cause of fulminant hepatic failure), are also possible. Although she is
   in the right demographic for autoimmune hepatitis, this is an extremely
   rare cause of fulminant hepatic failure.

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and developing fulminant hepatic failure. The most likely cause of her condition is an ischemic event from cocaine use, along with alcohol and Tylenol ingestion. The patient is experiencing symptoms such as asterixis, nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Fulminant hepatic failure can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and potential development of coma.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR (International Normalized Ratio) is significantly elevated at 11, indicating a high risk of bleeding. This can result in spontaneous bleeding or increased risk of bleeding during procedures.

3. Infection: Fulminant hepatic failure can compromise the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.

4. Hypoglycemia: Due to impaired liver function, the patient may experience hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary.

5. Renal dysfunction: Acute kidney injury can occur due to decreased perfusion secondary to hepatic failure. Regular assessment of renal function is required.

6. Hepatic hydrothorax: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can occur due to the liver's inability to produce enough albumin."

   Ddx of her acute hepatitis is broad and includes viral etiology,

   increases her risk of B-C syndrome, but her patent vessels on the OSH
   U/S with Dopplers argues strongly against a vascular cause of her
   hepatitis. She has not had any significant trauma or blood loss to
   suggest shock liver, although she did have what sounds like profound
   vomiting and diarrhea that could have led to significant volume
   depletion. Her ingestion of acetaminophen (2 grams per day, 14 grams
   over a period of a week by my calculation) does not seem to be enough
   to have caused such profound hepatitis. Likewise, her EtOH ingestion
   has been mild over the past week ([**3-26**] total drinks). I suppose the
   combination of the two could have been enough, though. Acute viral
   hepatitis (both A, which is more common, and B, which is a more common
   cause of fulminant hepatic failure), are also possible. Although she is
   in the right demographic for autoimmune hepatitis, this is an extremely
   rare cause of fulminant hepatic failure.

   1.       Hep failure: viral toxic vascular or autoimmune are the
   initial DDX. While her ETOH and Tylenol could be interacting as the
   complete explanation we will fully investigate. Repeat imaging to
   assess for vascular
 will get US with dopplers, and also check
   serologies for viral hepatitis and will send for autoimmune.
   For now will also continue NAC for full course.
   [**Hospital1 **] LFTs and inr need to be trended.  She has no acute indication for
   FFP at present.
   Needs q2 hour Neuro checks, q2 hour glucose checks.
   Low threshold to place CVL early though has adequate access now.
   Consult Transplant surgery and Hepatology to initiate Tx work up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure. The initial differential diagnosis includes viral, toxic, or autoimmune causes. The patient's history of alcohol and Tylenol use may be contributing to the condition, and further investigation is needed. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound with dopplers, will be conducted to assess for vascular issues. Serologies for viral hepatitis and autoimmune markers will also be checked. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will be administered for a full course. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR) need to be closely monitored. Neuro checks and glucose checks will be performed every two hours. There is a low threshold to place a central venous line (CVL) due to the patient's critical condition. Consultations with transplant surgery and hepatology have been initiated to explore potential treatment options. The patient's ICU care will involve nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's condition is critical, and they are currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of alcohol use and acetaminophen overdose, which could be contributing to the hepatic failure. Imaging shows that blood flow to the liver is normal, so ischemia is also a possible cause. Tests are being conducted to rule out viral hepatitis and autoimmune causes. The patient's liver function abnormalities and encephalopathy are concerning, and an evaluation for liver transplantation is underway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's increasing transaminitis and encephalopathy indicate a worsening of liver function. Hepatic encephalopathy can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and even coma if not managed properly.
2. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR suggests a coagulation disorder, which may result in increased bleeding risk.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to liver failure, making them more susceptible to infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, is essential.
4. Hepatic hydrothorax: Fluid accumulation in the lungs can occur as a result of liver dysfunction. This can lead to respiratory distress and may require interventions such as chest tube placement.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: Acute kidney injury can develop secondary to liver failure. Monitoring renal function and managing fluid balance"

   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM pending, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative.
   EBV, Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 2) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, will discuss
   possibilities for nutrition today on rounds.
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  Worsening INR up to 15
   yesterday.  The patient received Vit K 10mg PO yesterday with FFP x
   6units with a decrease in her INR to 2.3.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP to achieve INR between 3-4 per hepatology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, continues
   to trend down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending down but remaining stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol consumption, and ingestion of a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. The patient required intubation due to worsening encephalopathy. She is not a candidate for transplant due to her current alcohol and cocaine use. She is being followed by hepatology recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway protection: The patient's airway is at risk due to her altered gag reflex and inability to protect her airway. This increases the risk of aspiration.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been diagnosed with hypoglycemia, which requires careful monitoring and management.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and potential coma. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a significantly elevated INR (15) indicating a coagulopathy. She has received FFP (fresh frozen plasma) to correct the coagulopathy.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be related to hepatitis/hepatic failure. Close monitoring is required, and prophylactic antibiotics have been initiated.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is"

   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM pending, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative.
   EBV, Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 2) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, will discuss
   possibilities for nutrition today on rounds.
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  Worsening INR up to 15
   yesterday.  The patient received Vit K 10mg PO yesterday with FFP x
   6units with a decrease in her INR to 2.3.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR to achieve INR between [**1-22**]
   per hepatology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, continues
   to trend down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending down but remaining stable
   - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 32-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of alcohol and cocaine use, and it is suspected that her condition may be secondary to an ischemic event from cocaine use, as well as alcohol and Tylenol ingestion. The patient required intubation due to worsening encephalopathy. She is currently not a candidate for transplant due to her current substance use. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated bilirubin levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and decreased platelet count. Coagulation parameters indicate a prolonged prothrombin time/information ratio (PT/INR) of 27.5/2.8, respectively. Other lab results reveal elevated lactate levels, decreased albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and developing fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol consumption, and Tylenol ingestion, which may have contributed to the ischemic event leading to her condition. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She is being monitored closely for asterixis, a sign of hepatic encephalopathy, and other neurological changes. Several studies, including viral serologies and liver function tests, are pending. The patient is also being monitored for coagulopathy, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, which are likely related to her hepatitis and hepatic failure. Her code status is full code, and her disposition is pending resolution of symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored due to her altered hepatic function, which can affect glucose metabolism.
2. Aspiration: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway and altered gag reflex, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic function is compromised, increasing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by altered mental status and neurological dysfunction.
4. Liver failure: Given the severity of the patient's liver damage, there is a risk of further deterioration in liver function, leading to multi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of alcohol and cocaine use, and her condition has led to complications such as worsening encephalopathy, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. She is also on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and medications to manage her condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening encephalopathy indicates possible hepatic encephalopathy, which is a serious complication of liver failure. It can cause altered mental status, confusion, and even coma.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is significantly elevated, indicating a high risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are necessary to maintain a safe INR level.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia, which can be dangerous if not promptly treated. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of intravenous dextrose are essential.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate interventions should be considered.

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, will attempt to wean to PSV later
   today.
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM pending, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative.
   EBV, Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 2) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, will place OGT today
   and start tube feeds for nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start manitol.
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  Worsening INR up to 15
   yesterday.  The patient received Vit K 10mg PO yesterday with FFP x
   6units with a decrease in her INR to 2.3.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR to achieve INR between [**1-22**]
   per hepatology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, continues
   to trend down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending down but remaining stable
   - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy
   .
   FEN/Lytes: NPO, replete electrolytes as needed, will place OGT and
   start tube feeds today

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has been intubated due to worsening encephalopathy. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and potential medical complications such as cerebral edema, risk for aspiration, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hepatic encephalopathy indicate potential cerebral edema. Frequent neurochecks should be conducted to monitor for any changes, and if necessary, mannitol can be started to manage the condition.

2. Risk for Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration. Intubation was performed for airway protection, and attempts will be made to wean her to pressure support ventilation (PSV) later in the day.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, including elevated ALT and AST levels. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation profile is necessary to guide further management.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia due to her condition. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and repletion of electrolytes as needed are essential.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagul"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure in the setting of Tylenol, alcohol, and cocaine abuse. They are currently intubated for obtundation and have stage 3 encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 mmHg to 142/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of hypoglycemia. The flow sheet data shows a fluid balance with a total input of 3,840 mL and total output of 4,545 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 705 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and medications including propofol, morphine sulfate, dextrose 50%, haloperidol, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and potassium phosphate.

Physical examination findings include thin appearance, pupils that are pinpoint and minimally reactive, clear breath sounds, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, warm skin, and sedated mental status with no movement assessed. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin, low albumin, low potassium, low magnesium, low calcium, elevated lactate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure due to massive Tylenol ingestion, along with heavy alcohol and cocaine use. The patient's condition has led to multiple complications and medical issues.

1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests show significantly elevated transaminase levels and bilirubin, indicating severe liver damage. Supportive care will be provided, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will be continued for its protective effects on the liver.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is at high risk for cerebral edema due to encephalopathy. Neurological checks will be performed every hour, and mannitol will be administered if necessary. A head CT scan will also be done to monitor any changes.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires airway protection due to an inability to protect their own airway. They are currently on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode and will be attempted on pressure support ventilation (PSV) later today.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which could be due to pain or low blood volumes. A central venous line (CVL) will be placed to assess central venous pressure (CVP) and guide fluid management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, they are at an increased risk of developing"

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, will attempt to wean to PSV later
   today.
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM pending, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative.
   EBV, Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 2) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, will place OGT today
   and start tube feeds for nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start manitol.
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  Worsening INR up to 15
   yesterday.  The patient received Vit K 10mg PO yesterday with FFP x
   6units with a decrease in her INR to 2.3.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR to achieve INR between [**1-22**]
   per hepatology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, continues
   to trend down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending down but remaining stable
   - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy
   .
   FEN/Lytes: NPO, replete electrolytes as needed, will place OGT and
   start tube feeds today

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol use, and ingestion of a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. The patient was intubated yesterday due to worsening encephalopathy and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of airway issues and inability to protect it, which increases the risk of aspiration. There is also mention of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood sugar levels and is at risk for further episodes.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure has led to encephalopathy, affecting her brain function.
4. Ineffective coping: The patient may be experiencing emotional or psychological distress due to her condition.
5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver is not functioning properly, leading to various metabolic imbalances.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeds and glycemic control measures. She has multiple IV lines and prophylactic treatments in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of airway issues, including an inability to protect the airway, which poses a risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. The patient also has hepatic encephalopathy and ineffective coping mechanisms. Liver function abnormalities are present, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube (Nutren Pulmonary) and has a multi-lumen central venous catheter for medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's primary complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to significant blood loss and potential hypovolemic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently low, indicating a risk of hypoglycemia. This can result in symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and seizures if not treated promptly.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's inability to protect the airway increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, the patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries its own set of complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hepatic encephalopathy indicate impaired liver function. Hepatic encephalopathy can cause cognitive impairment, confusion, and changes in mental status"

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, patient may not be tolerating PSV
   yet, may require AC for a longer period of time, currently on propofol
   for sedation, may consider switching to versed and midazolam given
   history of alcohol use and may be withdrawing.
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 3) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start manitol.
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending up today
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of alcohol and cocaine use. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to intubation for airway protection and sedation with propofol. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Given the patient's history of alcohol use and liver failure, there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension and esophageal varices.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which can be attributed to impaired liver function and decreased production of glucose.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms due to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream that the liver is unable to clear.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently unstable, and she may require increased support or assistance in breathing.
5. Ineffective Airway Clearance: Due to sedation and altered mental status, the patient may have difficulty clearing her airway, increasing the risk of aspiration.
6. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes and bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV, currently on
   propofol for sedation, unable to use anything else given liver failure
   and decreased excretion
   - pt was alkalotic yesterday, will recheck ABG today to confirm
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 3) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start manitol.  As there was concern overnight
   of jerking movements, the patient will have an EEG today to rule out
   seizure activity
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending up today
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of alcohol and cocaine use and took a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. The patient required intubation due to worsening encephalopathy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is also on propofol for sedation.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a condition characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction due to liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR (international normalized ratio), indicating impaired blood clotting function. This increases the risk of bleeding.

3. Infection: The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics, suggesting concern for infection. In patients with compromised liver function, infections can be more severe and difficult to manage.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for low blood sugar levels due to impaired liver function and decreased glucose production.

5. Respiratory complications: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. The use of mechanical ventilation can also lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be exacerbated by liver dysfunction and coagulopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to worsening encephalopathy. The patient's medical history includes alcohol and cocaine use, and she ingested a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), a heart rate of 100 bpm, a blood pressure of 110/44 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low platelet count, coagulopathy (INR of 4.2), and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is also positive for Hepatitis A and Epstein-Barr virus, but negative for other hepatitis viruses. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring for potential complications such as cerebral edema, seizures, infections, bleeding, and hypoglycemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving propofol for sedation, and has a feeding tube for nutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can lead to altered mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infections: The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure. The cause of the liver failure is suspected to be a massive Tylenol ingestion, along with heavy alcohol and cocaine use. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are stable or slightly improving. Supportive care is being provided, including continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR) is necessary.

The patient is at high risk for cerebral edema and hepatic encephalopathy. Neurological checks are being conducted every hour, and mannitol is available at the bedside. An EEG has been ordered to determine if the patient's jerking movements are due to myoclonus or seizures. Consultation with hepatology is recommended regarding empiric anti-epileptic medication.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, requiring airway protection and mechanical ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation support has been initiated. The cause of the patient's metabolic alkalosis needs further investigation, including checking urine electrolytes and osmolality, monitoring pH trends, and reviewing medication lists. Mannitol administration may be contributing to the alkalosis.

Tachycardia is present and requires differentiation between pain, agitation, and toxins. The patient's urine output should be monitored, and central venous pressure (CVP) should be maintained between 8-12 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition can occur due to liver dysfunction and can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and even coma.
2. Cerebral Edema: Due to the risk of cerebral edema, the patient requires close monitoring, and measures such as mannitol administration and head CT scans may be necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to protect their own airway increases the risk of aspiration and respiratory failure. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be required.
4. Metabolic Alkosis: The underlying cause of the metabolic alkalosis needs to be identified and managed appropriately.
5. Tachycardia: Differentiating between pain, agitation, and toxins as potential causes of tachycardia is crucial for appropriate management.
6. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires ongoing monitoring and management.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of hypoglycemia, particularly given their critical condition and potential for altered nutritional intake.

The patient's critical illness and multiple organ dysfunction require close monitoring and prompt intervention to address these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old individual with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's medical history includes heavy alcohol (ETOH) use, cocaine use, and a massive Tylenol ingestion. The patient's transaminases and bilirubin levels are stable to slightly improved, and serologies are negative to date.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise. These include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, ineffective coping, and liver function abnormalities. The patient is at high risk for cerebral edema, which requires close monitoring and neuro checks every hour. Mannitol is available at the bedside, and a head CT has been performed, showing no cerebral edema.

The patient also has respiratory failure, requiring airway protection and being on pressure support ventilation (PSV). Additionally, the patient is experiencing tachycardia, possibly due to pain or low blood volumes. A central venous line (CVL) will be placed to assess central venous pressure (CVP) and guide fluid management.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   ingestion.  The patient required intubation secondary to worsening
   encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate for
   transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.  Will
   continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to follow
   serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV, currently on
   propofol for sedation, unable to use anything else given liver failure
   and decreased excretion, will attempt to decrease sedation today and
   assess neurological status
   - pt continues to be alkalotic, with two repeat ABGs yesterday unclear
   etiology may be secondary to overbreathing
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags, trending down
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 4) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy, plan to discontinue when we
   extubate the patient
   - continue acyclovir for empiric coverage of HSV until serologies
   return
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion, will change rate to
   600mg/hr, will plan to discontinue when INR <2, and LFT
s <1000
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  As there was concern overnight
   of jerking movements, the patient will have an EEG this AM to rule out
   seizure activity
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol consumption, and ingestion of a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. The patient required intubation due to worsening encephalopathy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has been deemed not a candidate for liver transplantation because of her current alcohol and cocaine use. The patient's current medications include acyclovir, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), pantoprazole (Protonix), and acetylcysteine for Tylenol ingestion. Her recent ABGs have shown persistent alkalosis, likely secondary to overbreathing. The patient's T bilirubin is rising up to 7.0, and she has been repleted with K and Phos. She is sedated and being set up for an EEG to monitor for seizure activity. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are also documented. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has grade 3 encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and potentially coma if not managed appropriately.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR due to hepatic failure, indicating impaired blood clotting. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Hypoglycemia:"

   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG during the afternoon showed alkalosis, likely from over
   breathing.  Repeated ABG at 11pm continued to show alkalosis.  Unclear
   etiology, may be secondary to mannitol or overbreathing on the vent
   - T bili rising up to 7.0
   - Repleted K with 20mEq and Phos 15mEq
   Currently the patient is sedated, being set up for EEG to monitor for

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   injestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV, currently on
   propofol for sedation, unable to use anything else given liver failure
   and decreased excretion
   - pt was alkalotic yesterday, will recheck ABG today to confirm
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 3) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start manitol.  As there was concern overnight
   of jerking movements, the patient will have an EEG today to rule out
   seizure activity
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending up today
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy
   .
   FEN/Lytes: tube feeds, replete electrolytes as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
- She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol consumption, and ingestion of a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.
- The patient required intubation due to worsening encephalopathy and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- She has elevated total bilirubin levels and liver function abnormalities.
- The patient is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to her current alcohol and cocaine use.
- She is being managed with hepatology recommendations.
- There is ongoing concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and ineffective coping.
- The patient has a coagulopathy secondary to hepatic failure, with an initial INR of 15, which has now improved to 4.2.
- She also has leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure.
- Prophylactic measures include compression stockings and antibiotics.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of acute hepatitis and liver failure, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to impaired clotting factors and portal hypertension.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's liver function is compromised, affecting glucose production and regulation. Hypoglycemia can occur as"

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   ingestion.  The patient required intubation yesterday secondary to
   worsening encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate
   for transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.
   Will continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to
   follow serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV, currently on
   propofol for sedation, unable to use anything else given liver failure
   and decreased excretion
   - pt continues to be alkalotic, unclear etiology
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags, trending down
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 4) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  As there was concern overnight
   of jerking movements, the patient will have an EEG this AM to rule out
   seizure activity
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   trending up today
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol use, and ingestion of a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. The patient required intubation yesterday due to worsening encephalopathy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is sedated with propofol and unable to use any other form of sedation due to liver failure and decreased excretion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of liver failure, which can lead to portal hypertension and subsequent variceal bleeding.
2. Hypoglycemia: Due to impaired liver function, the patient may experience episodes of low blood sugar levels.
3. Risk for Aspiration: Intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of aspiration, especially if the patient is not fully sedated.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated T Bili levels indicate ongoing liver dysfunction, which can cause hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and potential seizures.
5. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, including elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin, and abnormal bilirubin levels.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy secondary to hepatic failure, with an initial INR of 15. She received vitamin K"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's medical history includes heavy alcohol consumption (ETOH) and cocaine use, along with a massive Tylenol ingestion. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are stable to slightly improved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 154/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated, with an endotracheal tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine, BUN). The electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium, low calcium, and low magnesium.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications. These include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, inability to protect airway, ineffective coping, liver function abnormalities, respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, tachycardia, and others as noted in the housestaff notes.

The patient is currently receiving supportive care, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), nutrition through a pulmonary formula, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's condition is a result of massive Tylenol ingestion, along with heavy alcohol and cocaine use. The patient's transaminases and bilirubin levels are stable to slightly improved. The plan is to provide supportive care, continue N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the full course, and trend liver function tests (LFTs) and INR.

The patient is at high risk for cerebral edema due to hepatic encephalopathy. Neuro checks will be done every hour, and mannitol will be administered. The rhythmic jerking observed could be myoclonus or seizure activity.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, tachycardia, and hypoglycemia. These conditions need to be managed accordingly. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) for airway protection, but this needs to be adjusted. The patient's urine output and central venous pressure (CVP) should be monitored.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), propofol, codeine, oxycodone/acetaminophen, and NAC. The patient has allergies to codeine and oxycodone/acetaminophen.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, inability to protect the air"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Hepatic failure: The patient has fulminant hepatic failure due to massive Tylenol ingestion combined with heavy alcohol and cocaine use. His transamines and bilirubin levels are stable to slightly improved. Supportive care will be provided, including continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for a full course, changing to maintenance dosing at 600 mg/hr, and monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR).

2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires airway protection and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He has a mild respiratory infection and existing metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory support measures will be continued, and the patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The cause of metabolic alkalosis needs to be determined, possibly related to mannitol administration. Further investigation will include checking urine electrolytes and osmolarity, trending pH levels, and reviewing the patient's medication list.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to pain, agitation, or toxins. It is important to monitor urine output (UOP) and maintain central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12 mm"

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sednation.
   Serologies negative.
   - Mucomyst until Enzymes <1000, INR<2.0
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - Stop acyclovir given negative HSV status
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.
   - Head CT Today
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She is currently intubated for airway protection and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has a history of allergies to codeine and oxycodone/acetaminophen, both of which caused hives. She was previously sedated but the sedation was discontinued on 11/21/2108.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 101.2°F (38.4°C), tachycardia with a heart rate between 109-122 bpm, and hypertension with blood pressure ranging from 167/90 to 171/90 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,012 mL and output of 2,905 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,107 mL since midnight. Her blood products include 1,107 mL out, and her urine output is 1,107 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 1,566 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  With more information
   from the patient
s boyfriend, the patient is reported to have taken a
   large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation.   Most likely
   secondary to ischemic event from cocaine use and alcohol and Tylenol
   ingestion.  The patient required intubation secondary to worsening
   encephalopathy.  The patient has been deemed not a candidate for
   transplant by surgery given her current alcohol and cocaine use.  Will
   continue to follow hepatology recommendations.  Will continue to follow
   serologies.
   - intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV, currently on
   propofol for sedation, unable to use anything else given liver failure
   and decreased excretion, will attempt to decrease sedation today and
   assess neurological status
   - pt continues to be alkalotic, with two repeat ABGs yesterday unclear
   etiology may be secondary to overbreathing
   - continue to check q6H LFTs and coags, trending down
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - will continue empiric antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn (day 4) per
   hepatology for grade 3 encephalopathy, plan to discontinue when we
   extubate the patient
   - continue acyclovir for empiric coverage of HSV until serologies
   return
   - continue acetylcystine for Tylenol ingestion, will change rate to
   600mg/hr, will plan to discontinue when INR <2, and LFT
s <1000
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  As there was concern overnight
   of jerking movements, the patient will have an EEG this AM to rule out
   seizure activity
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with q6H labs
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   down
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, stable
   today
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 32-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has a history of cocaine use, alcohol abuse, and ingestion of a large quantity of Tylenol prior to presentation. The patient required intubation due to worsening encephalopathy and is currently sedated with propofol. Her current condition includes fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. She is intubated for airway protection and tolerating pressure support ventilation. The patient's neurological status is unable to be assessed due to sedation.

The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities including elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy with an INR of 15, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and electrolyte imbalances. Hepatitis A, B, C, and E serologies are negative, while EBV VCA IgM is negative. Active T+S is pending. The patient is being treated with acyclovir for HSV, acetylcysteine for Tylenol ingestion, and receiving tube feeds for nutrition. Mannitol is available for cerebral edema if needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening encephalopathy necessitated intubation and sedation. Close monitoring of neurological status is essential, and attempts to decrease sedation today will be made to assess neurological function.

2. Coagulopathy"

The patient's transaminases and bilirubin levels are stable or slightly improved. Supportive care is being provided, including continued N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is at high risk for cerebral edema, and neuro checks should be performed every hour. A head CT should be done since the patient is not waking up.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires airway protection and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

3. Fevers: The cause of the fevers needs to be investigated, including potential ICU infections. Cultures from blood, urine, and sputum should be checked, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) should be considered.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's urine electrolytes and osmolarity should be checked, and the pH should be trended. Medications should be reviewed, and the possibility of mannitol-related metabolic alkalosis should be considered.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure due to massive Tylenol ingestion, heavy alcohol and cocaine use. They have a fever, gastrointestinal bleed, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, ineffective coping, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's transaminases and bilirubin levels are stable to slightly improved. Supportive care is being provided, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for liver protection, close monitoring of LFTs and INR, and neuro checks every hour. Mannitol is available at the bedside, and a head CT is needed to evaluate for cerebral edema. Acyclovir has been discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver failure can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: Due to the inability to protect the airway, the patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia. The current respiratory support with CPAP/PSV may not be sufficient, and intubation may be required.
3. Fevers: The patient's persistent fever needs to be investigated for potential sources of infection, including ICU-acquired infections, and treated accordingly.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which requires further evaluation and management.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia needs"

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative, however according to hepatology, this could
   possibly be HSV hepatitis considering high fevers, leukocytosis and
   abdominal pain on presentation, even though serologies negative, will
   attempt to send PCR for HSV and restart acyclovir today.    T bili
   continues to rise.
   - Mucomyst until Enzymes <1000, INR<2.0
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Head CT yesterday showed no change
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   up and febrile.  Will send UA, urine and blood cultures today.
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, mildly
   decreased from yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She is currently unresponsive despite the cessation of sedation. Her liver enzymes are trending down, but she has high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain on presentation. Serologies are negative, but a PCR for HSV hepatitis will be sent, and acyclovir will be restarted today. Her total bilirubin continues to rise.

The patient has Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative, Hep C negative, CMV negative, and HIV negative. EBV is positive but IgM negative. Hep E, HSV, and ceruloplasmin are still pending. The patient is actively being monitored for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent neurochecks, and an EEG showed signs of encephalopathy. A head CT yesterday showed no change.

The patient has a coagulopathy secondary to hepatic failure, with an INR that peaked at 15. She received Vitamin K 10mg PO X1 and FFP x 8units, which resulted in a decrease in INR to 4.2 today. She will continue to be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding or if a procedure is planned.

The patient also has leukocytosis, likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, and thrombocytopenia, which is mildly decreased from yesterday. She will be monitored closely for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She presented with high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain. Her liver function tests are significantly elevated, and she has developed coagulopathy with an INR of 15. She has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has also experienced hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia. The etiology of her hepatitis is unknown, but serologies are negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and HIV. PCR for HSV is pending. She has tested positive for EBV but with negative IgM, indicating a past infection rather than an acute one. Hep E and ceruloplasmin results are still pending. The patient is currently receiving tube feeds for nutrition and close monitoring for evidence of cerebral edema. She has received FFP to correct the coagulopathy and is on prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's fulminant hepatic failure, there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status, confusion, and even coma.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagul"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
- She has been experiencing fever, with a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating between 138/66 mmHg and 165/92 mmHg.
- Her heart rate has been ranging from 94 to 120 beats per minute.
- The patient's respiratory rate has been between 18 and 30 breaths per minute.
- Her oxygen saturation has been consistently at 100%.
- The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, indicating leukocytosis.
- Liver enzymes, such as ALT and AST, are significantly elevated.
- Other lab results show low levels of albumin, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.
- The patient is intubated for airway protection and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- She has been sedated but not responsive.
- The patient's head CT scan is negative for any acute intracranial processes.
- She has been receiving tube feeds for nutrition and frequent neurochecks to monitor for cerebral edema.
- The patient's coagulopathy is secondary to hepatic failure, with an initial INR of 15 that has decreased to 4.2 after receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- She is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure.
- Her electrolytes need to be repleted as needed.
- The patient has been placed on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn.
- Code status is full code, and the patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to severe liver dysfunction, the patient may develop altered mental status and confusion.
2. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to respond or protect her airway may lead to ineffective coping and increased risk of aspiration.
3. Liver failure complications: The patient may be at risk for developing further complications related to liver failure, such as hepatic hydrothorax or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates impaired blood clotting, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure, she is at higher risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored and managed due to her hepatic failure.
7. Fluid balance disturbances: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.

It is important to note that the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by the healthcare team."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. 

The patient has a fever with an unknown origin, which is indicated by a temperature of 101.1°F (Tmax) and a current temperature of 99.6°F (Tcurrent). The patient also has gastrointestinal bleed, as evidenced by the presence of altered mental status and inability to protect airway. The patient's history of airway issues puts them at risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex.

Additionally, the patient has hypoglycemia, which is evident from the low blood glucose levels recorded in the lab results. The patient's liver function is abnormal, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT/INR). These abnormalities suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction affecting brain function.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate within normal limits (RR: 19 insp/min) and adequate oxygenation (SpO2: 100%). The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 533 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly elevated pH of 7.50 and a high PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 395.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR: 102 bpm), with blood pressure readings ranging from 138/66 mmHg to 165/92 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 6 mmHg.

The patient's labs show some variations in white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and electrolyte levels (Na+/K+/Cl-). These lab results indicate ongoing monitoring and assessment of the patient's condition.

The patient's nutritional support is being provided through enteral feeding (Nutren Pulmonary), and glycemic control is being maintained with insulin infusion. The patient has multiple IV lines in place for medication administration and fluid management.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications, including fever of unknown origin, gastrointestinal bleed, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and efforts are being made to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's vital signs and lab results indicate the need for ongoing monitoring and intervention."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure due to massive Tylenol ingestion on top of heavy ETOH and cocaine use. The patient's condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is at high risk for cerebral edema due to liver failure. Close monitoring of neurologic status and consideration of interventions such as mannitol or head CT are necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires airway protection and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The risk of aspiration should be closely monitored.

3. Fevers: The patient has an unknown origin fever, which could be due to ICU-acquired infections. Cultures and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated, and the source of infection should be investigated.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be secondary to liver dysfunction or other causes. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values, including coagulation profile, is essential.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia due to impaired hepatic glucose production. Frequent blood glucose monitoring and administration of IV dextrose as needed are important.

6. Risk for Venous Air Embolism (VAE): Intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of VAE. Vigilant monitoring for signs of VAE"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure due to massive Tylenol ingestion, heavy alcohol and cocaine use. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications.

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has slightly improved transamines, stable INR without fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but rising bilirubin. The hepatologist wants to continue acyclovir despite negative HSV IgM due to the patient's severe illness and concern for false negatives.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires airway protection and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes ICU infections. The lines appear to be okay, but cultures from blood, urine, and sputum need to be checked. The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but the chest X-ray is clear and no sputum is available.

4. Tachycardia: The possible causes include pain, agitation, toxins, and low filling pressures. The central venous pressure (CVP) should be trended, and maintenance can be done using normal saline (NS) or albumin.

Other issues mentioned in the housestaff notes need to be addressed. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with fulminant hepatic failure. They have been experiencing fever, with a recorded temperature of 101.1°F on November 23rd at 11:30 PM. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of blood products and a low hemoglobin level. There are signs of hypoglycemia, with a blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL on November 24th at 08:34 AM.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with pinpoint pupils that are minimally responsive. They have a distended abdomen and edema in their extremities. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive to painful stimuli. These symptoms suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver failure.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute and hypertension with a blood pressure ranging from 153/81 to 165/89 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Oxygenation is maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and the patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99%.

The laboratory results indicate abnormal liver function tests, including elevated levels of ALT and AST, as well as abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function. The platelet count is decreasing over"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with fulminant hepatic failure. They have been experiencing fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, risk for aspiration, hepatic encephalopathy, ineffective coping, and abnormal liver function. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and receiving various medications and infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and unknown origin of infection may indicate a potential risk for sepsis. The elevated white blood cell count further supports this possibility.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest a potential risk for AKI. This could be due to the patient's underlying liver disease and possible renal involvement.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate a potential risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and management of their liver function is crucial.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/PTT and low platelet count suggest a potential risk for coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and leuk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old with fulminant hepatic failure. They have a history of massive Tylenol ingestion, heavy alcohol consumption, and cocaine use. The patient's transaminases and bilirubin levels are stable to slightly improved. They require supportive care, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for acetaminophen toxicity, monitoring of liver function tests and INR, and neuro checks every hour due to the risk of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, leading to fulminant hepatic failure. This condition can result in complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, renal dysfunction, and infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired respiratory function, necessitating mechanical ventilation and airway protection. They may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration.
3. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers of unknown origin, which could be due to an underlying infection. Possible causes include healthcare-associated infections or systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
4. Tachycardia: The patient exhibits tachycardia, which may be attributed to factors such as pain, agitation, or toxins. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, considering the patient's history"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative, however according to hepatology, this could
   possibly be HSV hepatitis considering high fevers, leukocytosis and
   abdominal pain on presentation, even though serologies negative, will
   attempt to send PCR for HSV and restart acyclovir today.    T bili
   continues to rise.
   - Mucomyst until Enzymes <1000, INR<2.0
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative.  Hep E, HSV, ceruloplasmin still pending
   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Head CT yesterday showed no change
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   up and febrile.  Will send UA, urine and blood cultures today.
   -          monitor closely
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, mildly
   decreased from yesterday
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has been unresponsive despite the cessation of sedation, and her T bili continues to rise. Serologies are negative, but PCR for HSV will be sent, and acyclovir will be restarted. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is tolerating PSV. Hepatitis A, B, C, CMV, and HIV tests are negative, while EBV is positive but IgM negative. Hep E and HSV serologies are still pending. The patient is on tube feeds for nutrition and will receive Mucomyst until enzymes <1000 and INR <2.0. She will continue to be monitored closely for evidence of cerebral edema, bradycardia, and hypertension. If any change is observed, mannitol will be started. Her head CT yesterday showed no change. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's rising T bili and negative serologies, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR peaked at 15 due to hepatic failure. Close monitoring of coagulation status is necessary, and she may require FFP for procedures or if INR becomes very elevated.
3. Leukocytosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown origin fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, inability to protect airway, hepatic encephalopathy, ineffective coping, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's vital signs indicate a high temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/71 to 167/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 99%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,285 mL and output of 1,315 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,970 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive fluid balance may indicate an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output could suggest acute kidney injury.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and altered mental status may indicate hepatic"

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative, however according to hepatology, this could
   possibly be HSV hepatitis considering high fevers, leukocytosis and
   abdominal pain on presentation, even though serologies negative, will
   attempt to send PCR for HSV and restart acyclovir today.    T bili
   continues to rise.
   - Mucomyst until Enzymes <1000, INR<2.0
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative, ceruloplasmin negative.  Hep E, HSV
   pending
   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Head CT today prelim results with no bleed.
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and up to 4.2 today.
   - continue to monitor closely with [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give FFP only for very elevated INR or if procedure planned.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, trending
   up and febrile.  Will send UA, urine and blood cultures today, though
   repeat cultures negative.
   -          monitor closely, perhaps central fever, though CT not
   showing changes of edema, etc
   -          on prophylactic antibiotics of vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, mildly
   decreased from yesterday
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She is unresponsive despite the cessation of sedation. Her enzymes are trending down, but she still has high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain. Serologies are negative, so PCR for HSV and the restart of acyclovir will be attempted today. She has a rising T bili and is intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV. Hepatitis A, B, C, CMV, HIV, and EBV are negative, while Hep E and HSV are pending. She is being monitored for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent neurochecks, and mannitol will be started if any changes are observed. An EEG showed signs of encephalopathy, and a head CT today showed no bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's liver function abnormalities may lead to further deterioration in liver function, resulting in complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
2. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to protect her airway and altered mental status may increase the risk of aspiration and pose challenges in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels require close monitoring and repletion with glucose to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative, however according to hepatology, this could
   possibly be HSV hepatitis considering high fevers, leukocytosis and
   abdominal pain on presentation, even though serologies negative, will
   send PCR for HSV and restart acyclovir.    T bili continues to rise.
   - Mucomyst until Enzymes <1000, INR<2.0, will discuss with hepatology
   considering today patients LFTs are < 1000, but INR still elevated to
   3.1
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative, ceruloplasmin negative.  Hep E, HSV
   pending
   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Head CT yesterday with no acute process, AMS consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose given elevated
   ammonia level
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Initially thought to be related to hepatitis/hepatic
   failure, however continuing to trend up and pt has been consistently
   febrile.
   - Will send amylase and lipase to rule out pancreatitis.  Will consider
   abdominal imaging if the patient does not have a BM with bowel
   regimen.  Will send C. diff toxin
   - Will resend UA, urine, sputum and blood cultures today.
   - will discontinue all antibiotics for now, and treat based on cultures
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and down to 3.1 today.
   - continue to monitor closely
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure, mildly
   decreased from yesterday
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy
   .
   FEN/Lytes: tube feeds, replete electrolytes as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She is intubated for airway protection and is currently unresponsive, despite cessation of sedation. Her liver enzymes are trending down but remain elevated. She has high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain on presentation. Serologies are negative, but a PCR for HSV will be sent, and acyclovir will be restarted. T bili continues to rise. The patient has hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative, Hep C negative, CMV negative, HIV negative, [Doctor's First Name] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative, and EBV positive but IgM negative. Ceruloplasmin is negative. Hep E and HSV are pending.

The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, coagulopathy secondary to hepatic failure, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, fever of unknown origin, gastrointestinal bleed, and liver function abnormalities.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating liver damage. The cause of the hepatitis is unclear, but HSV hepatitis is being considered due to high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a significantly elevated INR, indicating impaired blood clotting. This is likely secondary to hepatic failure"

The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She is unresponsive despite cessation of sedation. Enzymes are trending down, but the patient still has high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain. Serologies are negative, so PCR for HSV will be sent, and acyclovir will be restarted. T bili continues to rise. The patient's INR is elevated at 3.1, and she has a history of hypoglycemia. She is intubated for airway protection and tolerating CPAP/PSV. Hepatitis A, B, C, CMV, and HIV are negative, but EBV is positive. Hep E and HSV are pending. The patient has leukocytosis and fever of unknown origin. She also has coagulopathy secondary to hepatic failure with a peak INR of 15. Thrombocytopenia is present, likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure. The patient is on tube feeds for nutrition and repletion for hypoglycemia. She is being monitored closely for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent neurochecks. Head CT showed no acute process, but AMS is consistent with encephalopathy. An aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose is being administered due to elevated ammonia levels. Potential medical complications include leukocytosis, fever of unknown origin, gastrointestinal bleed, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, ineffective coping, liver function abnormalities, inability to protect airway, and ineffective coping."

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative, however according to hepatology, this could
   possibly be HSV hepatitis considering high fevers, leukocytosis and
   abdominal pain on presentation, even though serologies negative.
   - D/C  mucomyst
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - Hep A positive, Hep A IgM negative, Hep B negative , Hep C negative,
   CMV negative, HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, anti-smooth muscle negative,
   EBV positive but IgM negative, ceruloplasmin negative.  Hep E, HSV
   pending
   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Ammonia level remains elevated, check daily
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose Q 4H titrate to 2
   bowel movements/day given elevated ammonia level
   .
   # Pancreatitis:  Likely explains fever and leukocytosis in setting of
   negative cultures
   -continue daily amylase/lipase
   -CT abdomen to eval for source, particularly in presence of distended
   abdomen
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and down to 2.9 today.
   - continue to monitor daily
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   improved from yesterday
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has been intubated for airway protection and is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient has tested negative for various viral serologies, but her EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus) IgM is positive, indicating a past infection. 

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. Firstly, she has a fever of 38.3°C (100.9°F) and leukocytosis, suggesting an underlying infection. However, her cultures have been negative so far. Secondly, she has evidence of pancreatitis, as indicated by elevated amylase and lipase levels. This could explain her abdominal pain and distention. 

Additionally, the patient has coagulopathy secondary to hepatic failure. Her initial INR was very high at 15, but she received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions, which improved her coagulation profile. However, she still requires close monitoring due to worsening coagulopathy. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely related to her hepatitis and hepatic failure. Her platelet count has improved from yesterday, but she should be closely monitored given the worsening coagulopathy.

The patient's electrolytes are currently being managed, and she is receiving tube feeds. Her glucose levels need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

The patient is at risk for several complications, including aspiration due to her inability to protect her airway, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, and ineffective coping due to her altered mental status.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunction."

   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:  Enzymes trending down but
   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative for HSV, HepC, HepB, Hep E, [**Doctor First Name **] Anti-smooth muscle,
   mucomyst discontinued yesterday.
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Intubated for airway protection, tolerating PSV
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Ammonia level remains elevated, check daily
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose Q 4H titrate to 2
   bowel movements/day given elevated ammonia level
   .
   # Pancreatitis:  Likely explains fever and leukocytosis in setting of
   negative cultures
   -continue daily amylase/lipase-as patient unable to communicate nausea,
   hunger
   -CT abdomen yesterday negative for sequelae
   -NPO
   -Attempt post-pyloric dobhoff placement, if unable as IR
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and down to 2.5 today.
   - continue to monitor daily
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   improved from yesterday
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She is currently intubated for airway protection and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/78 mmHg to 177/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 40%. She has a history of allergies to codeine and oxycodone/acetaminophen, and she has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia level and EEG showing signs of encephalopathy indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status and neurologic function is important, and mannitol may be started if there is any evidence of cerebral edema.
2. Pancreatitis: The CT abdomen showed questionable evidence of pancreatitis. The patient's fever and leukocytosis in the setting of negative cultures suggest that pancreatitis could be the cause. Daily amylase/lipase should be monitored, and post-pyloric doboff placement should be attempted if the patient is unable to tolerate tube feeds.

   patient is still unresponsive despite cessation of sedation.
   Serologies negative, however according to hepatology, this could
   possibly be HSV hepatitis considering high fevers, leukocytosis and
   abdominal pain on presentation, even though serologies negative.

   - active T+S
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Ammonia level remains elevated, check daily
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose Q 4H titrate to 2
   bowel movements/day given elevated ammonia level

","The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She has high fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain on presentation. Serologies are negative, but there is a possibility of HSV hepatitis. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is tolerating PSV. Hep A, B, C, and E are negative, as well as CMV and HIV. EBV is positive but IgM negative, and ceruloplasmin is negative. Hepatitis E and HSV are pending. The patient's T+S is active, and she is being monitored for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent neurochecks. Mannitol will be started if any evidence of change is observed, as the EEG showed signs of encephalopathy. Ammonia levels remain elevated, and she is on an aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose Q 4H titrated to 2 bowel movements/day due to elevated ammonia levels.

The patient likely has pancreatitis, which explains the fever and leukocytosis in the setting of negative cultures. She will continue daily amylase/lipase, and a CT abdomen will be done to evaluate for the source of pancreatitis, particularly in the presence of a distended abdomen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. She was previously on invasive ventilation but has been extubated and is awake but confused/encephalopathic. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's condition requires close monitoring of liver enzymes and international normalized ratio (INR) levels. Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose should be continued to manage elevated ammonia levels.
2. Pancreatitis: Given the patient's symptoms of fever and leukocytosis with negative cultures, pancreatitis is likely. Advancing the diet to clear liquids as tolerated and considering a post-pyloric tube may be necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR level is elevated due to hepatic failure. Daily monitoring of coagulation status is required.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure. Close monitoring of platelet levels is essential.
5. Thrombotic events: Due to the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU. They were placed on invasive ventilation due to their condition but were successfully extubated on [**2100**]. The patient's mental status improved, and they were able to communicate and answer questions, although they remained somewhat confused. A sitter was ordered for suicide risk, and Dobhoff was held as the patient was able to swallow medication.

The patient received various medications, including codeine, oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen (oral), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and acyclovir. They were also given pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of ICU medications.

Review of systems showed no significant changes except as noted below. The patient's vital signs were within normal ranges, with a temperature of 35.8 C (96.5 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/83 mmHg to 131/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

Hemodynamic monitoring showed a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 735 mL and output of 1145 mL. The patient's urine output was also recorded at 1145 mL.

Respiratory support was provided through CPAP/"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo woman with acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure.
   # Acute hepatitis/fulminant hepatic failure:
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - continue FS BG QID and replete for hypoglycemia, on tube feeds for
   nutrition.
   - continue to monitor for evidence of cerebral edema with frequent
   neurochecks, monitoring for bradycardia and hypertension, and if any
   evidence of change will start mannitol.  EEG showed signs of
   encephalopathy
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose Q 4H titrate to 2
   bowel movements/day given elevated ammonia level
   # Pancreatitis:  Likely explains fever and leukocytosis in setting of
   negative cultures
   -NPO
   #  Coagulopathy:  Secondary to hepatic failure.  INR peaked at 15.  The
   patient received Vit K 10mg PO X1 with total of FFP x 8units with
   initial decrease in INR and down to 2.5 today.
   - continue to monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatitis/hepatic failure,
   improved from yesterday
    - monitor closely given worsening coagulopathy
   FEN/Lytes: tube feeds held in setting of pancreatitis, replete
   electrolytes as needed
