","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with severe right-sided pneumonia. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility but presented to the emergency department today with increasing lethargy and an oxygen saturation of 92% on 2 liters of oxygen. His oxygen saturation improved to 98% on non-rebreather (NRB) in the emergency department and he was admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient received D50 for low blood glucose in the emergency department yesterday evening, as well as vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam (Vanc/Levo/ctx). He remained lethargic overnight, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 42, and PaO2 of 73 on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has several allergies, including Keflex, Avandia, Aldactone, and levofloxacin, with hives as a reaction to levofloxacin. He was on multiple medications, including MVI, losartan, lopressor, Plavix, amiodarone, aspirin, protonix, and coumadin.

His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased lethargy and low blood glucose. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with implanted ICD/pacer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presents to the emergency department from rehabilitation with weakness and hypoxia.

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has increasing oxygen requirements and desaturation to the mid-80s. He has been given intravenous furosemide and is currently on 60% FiO2.
2. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's chest CT shows worsening of multifocal pneumonia compared to previous films. His white blood cell count is elevated at 12.8. Other possible etiologies include bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or other post-infectious inflammatory processes. The patient also has peripheral eosinophilia and hilar nodules on CXR, which are likely reactive. An arterial blood gas (ABG) looks good at 7.43/42/73 on nasal high flow (NRB).
3. No antibiotics have been given yet, but the patient has received vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin in the emergency department. It is considered to perform a bronchoscopy and chest CT in the morning to compare with previous studies. If the patient shows spikes or becomes hypotensive"

   presents to the ED from rehab with weakness and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:  Has increasing O2 requirement this morning, now on 60%
   FiO2, desated to 80%.  Yesterday felt to eb fulid overloaded and put
   out well to iv lasix though overall only negative 600cc in 24 hours.
   Does not appear gorssly fluid overloaded and suspect that hypoxia is
   primarily due to destruction of lung parenchyma [**3-14**] his significant
   pneumonia.  However, would still likely benefit from further diuresis,
   particularly given elevated BNP of 4700 has some element of heart
   failure.  Creatinine bumped yesterday to diuresis to 1.8, baseline ins
   1.9.
   - lasix 40mg iv with goal negative 1.5 L today.  Additional lasix this
   evening if not at goal

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents to the ICU with weakness, hypoxia, and pneumonia. The patient's condition has worsened over time, with increasing oxygen requirements and desaturation to 80%. He also has crackles at the right base and mid lung fields, indicating possible fluid overload. His BNP level is elevated at 4700, suggesting some element of heart failure. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.8, indicating kidney dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) indicates a potential respiratory problem. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of his hypoxia.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's symptoms of crackles at the right base and mid lung fields, along with the negative fluid balance, suggest fluid overload. Diuretics may be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which has worsened over time. Cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. The patient may require intubation for bronchoscopy to aid in diagnosis and treatment.
4. Heart Failure: The elevated BNP level"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with an implanted ICD/pacer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presents to the emergency department with weakness and hypoxia. He has been admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/60 to 145/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is currently receiving IV furosemide and has had an increase in urine output since its administration. The patient's lab results show elevated BNP levels at 4700, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia appears to be worsening based on the CT chest showing interval worsening of the multifocal pneumonia compared to previous films. This could lead to further respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy. His condition may put him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's diabetes may predispose him to complications such as hypoglycemia, especially if his oral intake"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been unstable, with increased oxygen requirements overnight and today. There are no signs of infection, such as fever or productive cough. The patient's allergies are documented, including hives from Levofloxacin and unknown allergies to Avandia, Aldactone, and Keflex. The patient is on multiple medications, including Furosemide, Coumadin, MVI, Losartan, Plavix, ASA, Amiodarone, Protonix, Colace, RISS, Imdur, and Lopressor.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. Respiratory support is provided through a venti mask, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient has crackles in their right lung upon auscultation. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are low. Imaging reveals worsening consolidation on the right side of the chest. Microbiology tests, including blood and urine cultures, are pending.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's main concern is hypoxic respiratory distress, possibly due to post-pneumonic lung necrosis or pulmonary edema. A repeat chest CT is recommended to assess for necrosis or edema. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be initiated if there is any change in clinical status. Fluid"

   FiO2, desated to 80%.  Yesterday felt to eb fulid overloaded and put
   out well to iv lasix though overall only negative 600cc in 24 hours.
   Does not appear gorssly fluid overloaded and suspect that hypoxia is
   primarily due to destruction of lung parenchyma [**3-14**] his significant
   pneumonia.  However, would still likely benefit from further diuresis,
   particularly given elevated BNP of 4700 has some element of heart
   failure.  Creatinine bumped yesterday to diuresis to 1.8, baseline ins
   1.9.
   - lasix 40mg iv with goal negative 1.5 L today.  Additional lasix this
   evening if not at goal
   - patient currently full code, will need to discuss intubation with
   patient and his HCP
   # Multifocal PNA:  Ct scan [**Last Name (un) 1387**] worsening of lung process compared to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator/pacer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presents to the emergency department from rehabilitation with weakness and hypoxia.

The patient has been receiving increasing amounts of oxygen, currently on 60% FiO2, and is desaturated to 80%. The medical team suspects that his hypoxia is primarily due to destruction of lung parenchyma as a result of significant pneumonia. However, there is also an element of heart failure indicated by an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 4700.

The patient's creatinine level has increased from a baseline of 1.9 to 1.8, and diuretics have been initiated with a goal of negative 1.5 liters fluid balance today. Additional diuretics will be given if the patient does not achieve the target fluid balance.

The patient's code status is currently set to ""full code,"" and the medical team plans to discuss intubation with the patient and his healthcare proxy.

The patient also has multifocal pneumonia, with a worsening lung process compared to a CT scan two weeks ago. It is unclear whether the patient has failed pneumonia treatment or if another process, such as lung parenchym"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with a history of ICD/pacer placement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presents to the emergency department from rehab with weakness and hypoxia.

Assessment:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has been increasing, and he is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. There is suspicion of fluid overload, but the patient does not appear grossly overloaded. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 4700, indicating a likely component of heart failure. He received a total of 2000 cc of lasix yesterday but only had negative 600 cc in 24 hours.
2. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has worsening lung process compared to a CT scan two weeks ago. It is unclear if the patient has truly failed pneumonia treatment or if there is another process occurring, possibly lung parenchymal destruction as a sequelae of his pneumonia. No culture data is available yet. Other etiologies include bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or other post-infectious inflammatory processes, which is supported by peripheral eosinophilia. There are also hilar nodules on chest X-ray, which are likely reactive.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old male with MMP including afib on coumadin, CAD,
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/pacer, T2DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CKD who
   presents to the ED from rehab with weakness and hypoxia.
   # CHF Exacerbation:   Improving, now on 2L nc.  Had hypoxic yesterday,
   had increasing O2 requirement and was increased to  60% FiO2, desated
   to 80%.  Felt to be fulid overloaded and put out well to iv lasix
   though overall only negative 600cc in 24 hours.  Did not appear gorssly
   fluid overloaded and suspect that hypoxia is primarily due to
   destruction of lung parenchyma [**3-14**] his significant pneumonia.  However,
   BNP of 4700 and likely has  of heart failure
 has depressed EF of ~40%
   per TTE. Received a total of 200ic lasix yesterday and was -1.2L over
   24 hours.
   - no further diuresis as has decreased O2 requirement and Cr bumped to
   2.0
 diurese as needed
   # Multifocal PNA:  CT scan showed worsening of lung process compared to
   the one 2 weeks ago.  Unclear if patient has truly failed PNA treatment
   or if there is another process occurring
 possiblye lung parenchyema
   destruction as a sequalae of his pneumonia.  No culture data available
   .  WBC has normalized at 9.8 today. Other etiologies include BOOP or
   other post-infectious inflammatory process - has peripheral
   eosinophila.  Has hilar nodules on CXR which are likely reactive.
   - no abx for now (got vanc, CTZ, and levo in ED, s/p 10 day course of
   vanc and zosyn,  if spikes or becomes hypotensive, cover broadly with
   vanc and cefipime)
   - f/u cx, blood cx NGTD, urine cx negative, c. diff negative x2
   - continue respiratory support
   # Weakness/Lethargy:   Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1925**], likley  related to recent
   infectious process, nothing focal on exam
   - work up as above
   # Hypoglycemia:  Resovled. Had low fs at 44 in ED here, got 1 amp D50.
   Likely [**3-14**] to poor po intake and continued home insulin dosing
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue home insulin, ensure good po intake
   - SSI
   # Afib on coumadin: rate controlled currently, INR therapeutic 2.2
   - continue coumadin
   # CAD/cardiomyopathy:  Continue home regimen
   # T2DM:  Insulin as above

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator/pacer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presents to the emergency department from rehabilitation with weakness and hypoxia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure exacerbation, multifocal pneumonia, weakness/lethargy, hypoglycemia, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, which puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbations, and possibly cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with worsening lung processes, indicating a risk for respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, suggesting possible acute kidney injury due to factors like dehydration or underlying chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection-related Complications: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.
5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating a risk"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 107/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles on the right side of the chest, indicating possible pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs. There are no murmurs, murmurs, or gallops heard on cardiac auscultation. The patient's extremities show trace edema bilaterally, suggesting fluid retention. Bowel sounds are present and non-tender on abdominal examination. Neurologic assessment is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.7 g/dL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and increased creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35-40% on echocardiogram, suggesting reduced cardiac function. The chest X-ray shows"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)/pacer, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) from rehabilitation with weakness and hypoxia. He has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, multifocal pneumonia (PNA), weakness/lethargy, hypoglycemia, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's low urine output (UOP) may indicate impaired kidney function, which could be due to his underlying CKD or recent use of lasix.
2. Airway Clearance, Impaired: The patient has crackles at the right base-mid lung fields and scattered wheeze, suggesting possible pulmonary edema or worsening pneumonia.
3. Respiration/Gas Exchange, Impaired: The patient's intermittent hypoxia to the mid 80s indicates inadequate oxygenation, likely related to his PNA or CHF exacerbation.
4. Gait, Impaired: The patient's impaired gait may be a result of his recent infection, CKD, or other underlying medical conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old male with MMP including afib on coumadin, CAD,
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/pacer, T2DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CKD who
   presents to the ED from rehab with weakness and hypoxia.
   # Multifocal PNA:  CT scan showed worsening of lung process compared to
   the one 2 weeks ago.  Unclear if patient has truly failed PNA treatment
   or if there is another process occurring
 possiblye lung parenchyema
   destruction as a sequalae of his pneumonia.  No culture data
   available.  WBC has normalized at 9.8 today. Other etiologies include
   BOOP or other post-infectious inflammatory process - has peripheral
   eosinophila.  Has hilar nodules on CXR which are likely reactive.
   - no abx for now (got vanc, CTZ, and levo in ED, s/p 10 day course of
   vanc and zosyn),  if spikes or becomes hypotensive, cover broadly with
   vanc and cefipime
   - f/u cx, blood cx NGTD, urine cx negative, c. diff negative x2
   - continue supplementary O2 as needed
   - Will send a sputum cx
   - Guafenesin, incentive spirometry.
   - Standing atrovent nebs, albuterol prn
   - Speech and swallow consult to ruleout aspiration as contributor to
   his lung issues.
   # CHF Exacerbation:   Pt currently on 4L nc follow additional epsiode
   of intermittent hypoxia to the mid 80s with movement. TTE showed an EF
   of 35-40%.  Pt was given a regimen of Lasix several days ago as he was
   suspected of being fluid overloaded, however his Cr increased with
   diuresis.  Was even yesterday and for LOS is negative 1.5 L.
   - As the patient
s Cr remains elevated at 2.3 (above his baseline of
   1.9), will not further diuresis today.
   - Will aim for even I/O
   # DM: As patient
s sugars are running on the low side, will given half
   his home NPH dose.
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue half of home insulin, ensure good po intake
   - SSI
   # Afib on coumadin: rate controlled currently, INR was supratherapeutic
   today at 6.4
   - Hold coumadin and check daily coags, goal INR of [**3-15**].
   - Continue amiodarone and metoprolol.
   # CKD, Stage III with superimposed ARF: Cr 2.3 this morning, likely [**3-14**]
   lasix diuresis, baseline is 1.9
   - trend
   - renally dose medications
   # CAD/cardiomyopathy:  Continue home regimen of metoprolol, ASA,
   plavix, losartan, and isorsorbide mononitrate.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Episodic hypoxemia overnight that has responded to secretion clearance
   and increase in O2 to 3 lpm. He denies chest pain or dyspnea at rest.
   Fluid balance is net negative with the aid of diuretics. He has been
   off IV antibiotics for a few days and diarrhea also has improved with
   stool C.Difficile toxin returning negative.
   Exam notable for Tm of 98.6 BP of 105/54 HR of 79 RR of 16 with sat of
   95%  on 3 lpm O2 . his mucous membranes are dry and he does have
   inspiratory rales in right lung field and at left base. There is a
   paucity of wheeze and peripheral edema. He is oriented to name and
   person but not place.
   Labs notable for WBC of 9.5 K, HCT of 32.2 , K+ of 4.0 , Cr of 2.3 .CXR
   with diffuse right lung ASD and Chest CT also shows left basilar ASD.
   Agree with plan to hold antibiotics given treatment for full course of
   CAP. He has a multifocal process  ( infectious  PNA vs post infectious
   BOOP vs ? BALC) and appears well compensated at rest. We will recheck
   sputum GS, C&S and start him standing atrovent nebs with PO mucinex and
   incentive spirometry to help secretion clearance. He will need formal
   evaluation of his speech and swallow early next week but will need
   strict aspiration precautions nontheless. Daily diuretic need will be
   assessed  to prevent component of HCF from adding to current O2 needs.
   He will transition to regular telemetered bed today if no setbacks when
   he moves from bed to chair.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill but has improved with supportive therapy

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with an implanted ICD/pacer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents to the emergency department with weakness and hypoxia from a rehabilitation facility.

The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which is not improving despite treatment. Other possible causes for the patient's lung issues include bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or other post-infectious inflammatory processes. The patient also has hilar nodules on chest X-ray, which are likely reactive.

The patient's fluid balance is negative due to diuresis for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. However, the patient's creatinine level remains elevated at 2.3, indicating ongoing renal impairment. The patient's blood glucose levels are running on the low side, so half of his home NPH dose will be given.

The patient's INR is supratherapeutic at 6.4, so coumadin will be held, and daily coagulation checks will be performed with a goal INR of 3-15. The patient's medications will be renally dosed considering his chronic kidney disease.

The patient's cardiac conditions include CAD/cardiomyopathy, for which he is on metoprolol, ASA"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)/pacer, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient presents to the emergency department with weakness and hypoxia from a rehabilitation facility. He is diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, multifocal pneumonia (PNA), weakness/lethargy, hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD/cardiomyopathy, and T2DM.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/54 mmHg to 126/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals crackles at the right base-mid lung fields, scattered wheeze, trace edema, and warm skin.

Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, low blood glucose, and decreased total white blood cell count. Imaging tests show worsening lung process compared to two weeks ago, with no available culture data. The patient's condition is complicated by possible lung parenchymal destruction as a sequelae of pneumonia, multifocal"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old male with MMP including afib on coumadin, CAD,
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/pacer, T2DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CKD who
   presents to the ED from rehab with weakness and hypoxia.
   # Multifocal PNA:  CT scan showed worsening of lung process compared to
   the one 2 weeks ago.  Unclear if patient has truly failed PNA treatment
   or if there is another process occurring
 possiblye lung parenchyema
   destruction as a sequalae of his pneumonia.  No culture data
   available.  WBC has normalized at 9.8 today. Other etiologies include
   BOOP or other post-infectious inflammatory process - has peripheral
   eosinophila.  Has hilar nodules on CXR which are likely reactive.
   - no abx for now (got vanc, CTZ, and levo in ED, s/p 10 day course of
   vanc and zosyn),  if spikes or becomes hypotensive, cover broadly with
   vanc and cefipime
   - f/u cx, blood cx NGTD, urine cx negative, c. diff negative x2
   - continue supplementary O2 as needed
   - Will send a sputum cx
   - Guafenesin, incentive spirometry.
   - Standing atrovent nebs, albuterol prn
   - Speech and swallow consult to ruleout aspiration as contributor to
   his lung issues.
   # CHF Exacerbation:   Pt currently on 4L nc follow additional epsiode
   of intermittent hypoxia to the mid 80s with movement. TTE showed an EF
   of 35-40%.  Pt was given a regimen of Lasix several days ago as he was
   suspected of being fluid overloaded, however his Cr increased with
   diuresis.  Was even yesterday and for LOS is negative 1.5 L.
   - As the patient
s Cr remains elevated at 2.3 (above his baseline of
   1.9), will not further diuresis today.
   - Will aim for even I/O
   # DM: As patient
s sugars are running on the low side, will given half
   his home NPH dose.
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue half of home insulin, ensure good po intake
   - SSI
   # Afib on coumadin: rate controlled currently, INR was supratherapeutic
   today at 6.4
   - Hold coumadin and check daily coags, goal INR of [**3-15**].
   - Continue amiodarone and metoprolol.
   # CKD, Stage III with superimposed ARF: Cr 2.3 this morning, likely [**3-14**]
   lasix diuresis, baseline is 1.9
   - trend
   - renally dose medications
   # CAD/cardiomyopathy:  Continue home regimen of metoprolol, ASA,
   plavix, losartan, and isorsorbide mononitrate.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy with an implanted ICD/pacer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.
- The patient presents to the emergency department from rehabilitation with weakness and hypoxia.
- The patient has multifocal pneumonia, with a CT scan showing worsening lung process compared to two weeks ago. The cause of this worsening is unclear, but possibilities include pneumonia treatment failure or another inflammatory process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or post-infectious inflammation.
- The patient's white blood cell count has normalized, and there are no current signs of infection, including negative cultures for Clostridium difficile toxin and urine culture.
- The patient is being treated with supplementary oxygen as needed and will have a sputum culture sent.
- The patient is also being given guaifenesin and incentive spirometry to help with lung function.
- The patient has had an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), which was initially suspected due to fluid overload. However, diuretic therapy resulted in an increase in creatinine levels, so further diuresis has been temporarily halted.
- The patient's diabetes management involves monitoring blood sugar levels and providing"
