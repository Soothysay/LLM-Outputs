","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male who underwent colectomy 7 days ago. He presented with worsening anemia, new fevers, and an intrapelvic hematoma. He has been on IV heparin for post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) and was taken to the operating room today for evacuation of the hematoma and removal of more ileum. The patient is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is currently being treated with heparin. However, the anti-coagulation therapy is temporarily held due to concerns about bleeding complications related to the post-operative hematoma. There is also a discussion regarding the possibility of placing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to prevent further embolic events.
2. Hematoma: The patient has a large pelvic hematoma, which may require close monitoring and possible surgical intervention. The hematoma is causing significant blood loss, leading to worsening anemia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support in the ICU. The plan is to wean off the ventilator and potentially extubate in the morning. However, there is a concern about ongoing respiratory failure and the presence of atelectasis or pneumonia.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is being followed closely for hypertension."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is a plan to reduce sedation and attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to eventually extubate the patient.

2. Pelvic hematoma: The patient developed a pelvic hematoma as a complication of anticoagulation. Surgical evacuation was performed, and hopefully, the hematoma has resolved.

3. Pulmonary embolism, acute: The patient may have a pulmonary embolism, likely due to a clot source from the inferior vena cava (IVC), iliacs, or femorals. Repeat imaging of the lower extremities (NIVS) is needed to identify the source. Anticoagulation is held per surgery, and an IVC filter may be considered if the patient is unable to resume anticoagulation.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to blood loss. Serial hematocrit (Hct) measurements will be continued, and anticoagulation will be held.

5. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, and it is recommended to complete the full course of antibiotics.

6. Bowel resection: The patient underwent bowel resection, and post-operative plans will be implemented as per surgery.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a total colectomy. She developed a pelvic hematoma in the setting of anticoagulation for a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was intubated, and her condition improved with the evacuation of the hematoma. 

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:
1. Hematoma and Anemia: The patient had a pelvic hematoma that was evacuated. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels are decreasing, likely due to a combination of blood loss during surgery, dilutional effects from fluid administration, and ongoing bleeding. It is important to monitor her Hct levels and provide blood transfusions as needed to maintain a target Hgb level of less than 8. She is also on a heparin drip for the PE and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 50-70.
2. Anxiety: The patient has chronic anxiety issues and is currently taking Xanax three times a day at home. A social consult has been ordered to further address her anxiety, and the judicious use of benzodiazepines in the hospital is recommended due to her high doses of narcotics for pain control.
3. Pulmonary Embolus: The patient has a segmental PE identified on imaging. It was decided to restart anticoagulation despite the risk"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a total colectomy and developed a pelvic hematoma while on anticoagulation for a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, anxiety, and anemia secondary to blood loss.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematoma and Anemia: The patient has a downward trend in hematocrit (Hct) since surgery due to multifactorial causes such as dilutional component, anticoagulation, and ooze from the surgical site. Monitoring Hct regularly and transfusing to maintain a target Hgb level of less than 8 is important.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a segmental PE and has been restarted on anticoagulation despite the risk of recurrent bleeding due to the severity of the hematoma. If she is not put back on anticoagulation, alternative measures like placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be considered.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has multiple reasons for tachycardia, including volume depletion, under-sedation, and known PE. It is important to monitor heart rate (HR) and urine output (Uop), check central"

","The patient is a  [age]-year-old male with a medical history of anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, presenting to the ICU with acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been extubated without complication and restarted on a heparin drip due to the detection of a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The PICC line was pulled, and the patient is now on a PCA. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been drifting downward but remains asymptomatic with no chest pain, shortness of breath, or confusion. There are no acute abdominal findings, and no increased drainage from the ostomy site. Surgery has been notified, and the patient will continue on the heparin drip. 

The patient's allergies include Tussionex (oral) due to unknown reasons and Mercaptopurine due to leukopenia. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on [date] at 07:25 PM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [date] at 02:00 AM.

   57yo woman with ulcerative colitis s/p recent total colectomy who
   developed pelvic hematoma in the setting of anticoagulation for new PE.
   # Hematoma and Anemia:
   Patient is s/p evacuation of hematoma.
   - monitor Q6H Hct
   - active type and screen
   - transfuse to goal Hct > 24
   - hold heparin gtt for at least 24 hours post-op (until 11pm [**8-8**]); see
   anticoagulation discussion below.
   - INR was 0.9 when checked [**8-5**]; will recheck coags
   - appreciate surgery input
   - monitor surgical wound and abdominal exam
   # Pulmonary embolus:  Segmental PE idenitified [**8-2**].  Decision
   regarding whether to reinitiate anticoagulation should be weighed
   against risk of potential recurrent bleeding given severity of
   hematoma.  If she is not put back on anticoagulation, she may be a
   candidate for IVC filter if she has persistent LE clot.
   - obtain complete LE dopplers and review CT abd/pelvis with radiology
   for evidence of iliac or femoral clot
   - discuss with surgery and GI team regarding risks/benefits of
   restarting anticoagulation
   # Tachycardia:
   Patient has multiple reasons to be tachycardic, including volume
   depletion, under-sedation, and known PE.  Note that she also has a h/o
   anxiety on chronic benzodiazepines in house.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be due to her
   steroids.
   - increase sedation with propofol and fentanyl while on vent
   - bolus IV fluids and monitor HR and Uop
   - check CVP to help assess volume status
   # Hypertension:
   Patient noted to be very hypertensive upon arrival to ICU.  She is not
   sufficiently sedated on the vent, although her steroids might also be
   driving her elevated BPs.
   - hydralazine prn, although note that this may
   - will hold off on beta blockers for now
   # Mechanical ventilation:
   Patient remains intubated post-op pending hemodynamic stabilization.
   Note that she is currently being treated for hospital acquired
   pneumonia and also has pleural effusions as well as atelectasis.
   - ABG; will wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - propofol and fentanyl for sedation with the hopes that she may be
   extuabatable in the morning
   # Leukocytosis:
   Has had leukocytosis, likely from steroids, but her white count has
   jumped.  This may be in the setting of hematoma and surgery, but will
   eval for infection.
   - blood, urine, sputum Cx
   - continue vanc/zosyn (day 1 = [**8-3**])
   # Non-gap acidosis:
   - will use LR for volume resuscitation
   # Ulcerative Colitis: s/p total colectomy with end ileostomy
   - moniotor surgical site
   - appreciate GI input
   # Atelectasis:
   Provide with IS after extubation.
   # Skin rash:  appears to be in areas that are in contact with bed, ?
   contact dermatitis
   # COPD: ipratropium and albuterol
   # OSA:
   - after extubated, will need CPAP at night
   # FEN:  strict NPO including medications per surgery; if cannot be
   extubated, would start TPN; replete lytes; LR at 100/hr per surgery
   with boluses PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who recently underwent a total colectomy. She developed a pelvic hematoma while being anticoagulated for a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient had an evacuation of the hematoma and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hematoma and Anemia:
   - The patient had a pelvic hematoma, which has been evacuated.
   - She is anemic with a hematocrit (Hct) level drifting downward.
   - The Hct should be monitored, and the patient should be transfused to maintain a goal Hct > 24.
   - Heparin drip should be held for at least 24 hours post-op due to the risk of recurrent bleeding.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE):
   - The patient has been diagnosed with a segmental PE.
   - The decision regarding anticoagulation should be weighed against the risk of potential recurrent bleeding given the severity of the hematoma.
   - If the patient is not put back on anticoagulation, she may be a candidate for an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter if there is persistent lower extremity (LE) clot.
   - Complete LE dopplers and review of the CT abdomen/pelvis should be done for evidence of iliac or femoral clot.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- post-op.  Extubated and stable.
   PELVIC HEMATOMA -- complication of anticoagulation; s/p surgical
   evacuation.  Hopefully resolved.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ? clot source from IVC/iliacs/femorals -->
   repeat NIVS (esp right LE).  Anticoagulation per Surgery --> hope to
   resume once determined to be safe per Surgery, maintain PTT 50-70.  IVC
   filter if unable to resume anticoagulation.
   RUE BLOOD CLOT -- likely attributed to PICC.  PICC d/c'd.  Monitor
   exam, local care (elevation).
   ANEMIA -- blood loss.  Continue serial Hct.  Continue anticoagulation,
   monitor PTT (maintain 50-70).
   PNEUMONIA [**Hospital **] Hospital acquired pneumonia, complete course of
   antimicrobials.
   s/p BOWEL RESECTION -- plans as per surgery.  Monitor for ileus.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Hope to resume TF.
   ULCERATIVE COLITIS -- continue usual meds.
   HTN - Hydralazine prn
   NEUROPSYCH -- anxiety (anxiolytics use at home) and emotional lability
   (possible contribution of steroids)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is now stable. However, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's post-operative status and possible underlying lung issues.

2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has developed a blood clot in the right upper extremity and has a history of anticoagulation. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs. The patient's repeat NIVS (Noninvasive Venous Ultrasound) will help identify any new or additional clot sources.

3. Right upper extremity blood clot: The patient has a clot in the right upper extremity, likely attributed to the PICC line. The PICC line has been removed, and local care with elevation is being monitored.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to blood loss during surgery. Serial Hct (hematocrit) will be monitored, and the patient will continue anticoagulation while maintaining a PTT (partial thromboplastin time) of 50-70.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, and a complete course of antimicrobials has been administered.

6. Bowel resection: The patient underwent bowel resection surgery, and plans will be made according to surgical"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- post-op.  Extubated and stable.
   PELVIC HEMATOMA -- complication of anticoagulation; s/p surgical
   evacuation.  Hopefully resolved.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ? clot source from IVC/iliacs/femorals -->
   repeat NIVS (esp right LE).  Anticoagulation per Surgery --> hope to
   resume once determined to be safe per Surgery, maintain PTT 50-70.  IVC
   filter if unable to resume anticoagulation.
   RUE BLOOD CLOT -- likely attributed to PICC.  PICC d/c'd.  Monitor
   exam, local care (elevation).
   ANEMIA -- blood loss.  Continue serial Hct.  Continue anticoagulation,
   monitor PTT (maintain 50-70).
   PNEUMONIA [**Hospital **] Hospital acquired pneumonia, complete course of
   antimicrobials.
   s/p BOWEL RESECTION -- plans as per surgery.  Monitor for ileus.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Hope to resume TF.
   ULCERATIVE COLITIS -- continue usual meds.
   HTN - Hydralazine prn
   NEUROPSYCH -- anxiety (anxiolytics use at home) and emotional lability
   (possible contribution of steroids)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is anemia, and they were extubated yesterday. They continue to exhibit some emotional lability. Anticoagulation was resumed but was discontinued this morning due to a low hematocrit (Hct) level. A new right upper extremity (UE) clot was identified, and the PICC line was removed. The patient's pain control improved with the use of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fatigue, abdominal pain, anemia, and a right UE clot.

Vital Signs:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate (HR) of 107 bpm (range 91-127 bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 92/53 mmHg (range 69-162/97 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR) of 13 breaths per minute (range 11-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on a nasal cannula with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears to be well-nourished, not in acute distress, and is overweight/obese. The patient's eyes are pupil reactive and conjunctivae are pale. The head, ears"

   57yo woman with ulcerative colitis s/p recent total colectomy who
   developed pelvic hematoma in the setting of anticoagulation for new PE.
   # Hematoma and Anemia:
   Patient is s/p evacuation of hematoma with downward trend in Hct since
   surgery.  Multifactorial etiology: dilutional component, on
   anticoation, ooze from surgical site.
   - monitor Q6H Hct; active type and screen
   - transfuse to goal Hgb<8
   - On Heparin drip for PE and RUE DVT, goal PTT 50-70
   -abdominal pain out of proportion to clinical exam, continue PCA for
   pain control and d/c reglan as promotility effects may contribute to
   discomfort
   - appreciate surgery input
   - monitor surgical wound and abdominal exam
   #Anxiety
   - pt has chronic issues with anxiety, on xanax TID at home
   -social consult to see
   -judicious use of benzos in hospital considering pt
s high doses
   narcotics for pain control
   # Pulmonary embolus:  Segmental PE idenitified [**8-2**].  Decised to
   reinitiate anticoagulation despite risk of potential recurrent bleeding
   given severity of hematoma.  If she is not put back on anticoagulation
   - on heparin drip with goal PTT 50-70 given bleeding risk
   - longterm consideration for placement of IVC filter
   # Tachycardia:
   Patient has multiple reasons to be tachycardic, including volume
   depletion, under-sedation, and known PE.  Note that she also has a h/o
   anxiety on chronic benzodiazepines in house.
   - bolus IV fluids and monitor HR and Uop
   - check CVP to help assess volume status
   -Ativan 1mg PRN adequately controls anxiety
   # Hypertension:
   Patient noted to be very hypertensive upon arrival to ICU.  She is not
   sufficiently sedated on the vent, although her steroids might also be
   driving her elevated BPs.
   - hydralazine prn, although note that this may
   - will hold off on beta blockers for now
   #HAP with pleural effusions and atelectasis: s/p intubation, improved
   respiratory status
   - Continue to wean off NC as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90
   - complete antibiotic course for HAP, vanco and zosyn
   - clinical improvement: decreased WBC, afebrile, improved respiratory
   status
   -encourage incentive spirometry to aid ventilation
   # Ulcerative Colitis: s/p total colectomy with end ileostomy
   - moniotor surgical site
   - appreciate GI input
   # Skin rash:  appears to be in areas that are in contact with bed, ?
   contact dermatitis
   # COPD: ipratropium and albuterol
   # OSA:
   - after extubated, will need CPAP at night
   # Code:  FULL
   # Communication: Brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6779**].
   # DISPO:  to surgical floor once extubated and stabilized

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who recently underwent a total colectomy. She developed a pelvic hematoma in the setting of anticoagulation for a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient had evacuation of the hematoma with a downward trend in hematocrit (Hct) since surgery. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of anxiety and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which may contribute to impaired skin integrity.

2. Hematoma and anemia: The patient has a hematoma and anemia due to blood loss during surgery. It is important to monitor her Hct regularly and transfuse as needed.

3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a confirmed segmental PE. She is at risk of recurrent bleeding due to the recent hematoma, so she has been put back on anticoagulation with heparin drip. Long-term consideration for placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is also being discussed.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has multiple reasons for tachycardia, including volume depletion, under-sedation, and known PE. It is important to assess her volume status and provide appropriate fluid management.

5. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, which may be due to inadequate sedation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a total colectomy. She developed a pelvic hematoma while on anticoagulation for a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The hematoma was evacuated, but she has anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient has multiple medical issues including anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a skin rash, which may be due to contact dermatitis or another underlying cause.
2. Hematoma and anemia: The patient has a downward trend in hematocrit (Hct) since surgery, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a confirmed PE and requires anticoagulation to prevent further clot formation.
4. Anxiety: The patient has chronic anxiety and is on Xanax at home. It is important to manage her anxiety appropriately while in the hospital.
5. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive, which may be due to inadequate sedation, steroid use, or other factors. Blood pressure should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
6. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while in the hospital. Antibiotic treatment should be continued until resolution.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a total colectomy. She developed a pelvic hematoma while on anticoagulation for a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The hematoma was evacuated, and the patient is being monitored closely. She also has anemia secondary to blood loss, pneumonia acquired during her hospital stay, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and anxiety.

The patient is currently on a heparin drip for PE and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with a goal PTT of 50-70. She is also receiving pain management through a diluted PCA. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient's surgical wound and abdominal exam are being monitored.

The patient's anxiety is being addressed with social consultation, and she is prescribed ativan on an as-needed basis. Her hypertension is being managed with hydralazine on a prn basis, and beta blockers are being held off for now.

The patient's hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being treated with a course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, with plans to discontinue piperacillin/tazobactam tomorrow. She is showing improvement in respiratory status and is encouraged to use incentive spirometry to aid ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   PELVIC HEMATOMA -- complication of anticoagulation; s/p surgical
   evacuation.  Stable Hct suggests resolution of bleeding.
   PERITONITIS
 Enterococcus by surgical culture -
 continue vancomycin
   pending sensitivities.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- Anticoagulation per Surgery --> maintain
   PTT 50-70.  IVC filter if unable to maintain anticoagulation.
   RUE BLOOD CLOT -- likely attributed to PICC.  PICC d/c'd.  Monitor
   exam, local care (elevation).
   ANEMIA -- blood loss.  Continue serial Hct.  Continue anticoagulation,
   monitor PTT (maintain 50-70).  Post transfusion Hct now stable.
   PNEUMONIA [**Hospital **] Hospital acquired pneumonia, complete course of
   antimicrobials (zosyn to be completed [**8-11**])
   s/p BOWEL RESECTION -- plans as per surgery.  Monitor for ileus.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Continue TPN.
   ULCERATIVE COLITIS -- continue usual meds.
   HTN
 Attributed to underlying HTN, exacerbation by pain and anxiety.
   Treat anxiety and pain.  Hydralazine prn
   NEUROPSYCH -- anxiety (anxiolytics use at home) and emotional lability
   (possible contribution of steroids)
