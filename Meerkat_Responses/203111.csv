   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Multiple organ dysfunction including
   pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, renal failure.  Source possibilities
   include pulmonary, GI (?could she have perf given abd exam), line
   infection (has port), urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS
   infection (though other sources probably more likely).  Needs
   simultaneous broad spectrum treatment and workup.
   - blood cultures pending.
   - urine culture and UA if voids.
   - CT torso today.
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and renal failure as able.
   .
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension. Lactate to 4.3  from 10. Acidosis resolved.
   - Correct BP.
   - Trend lactate.
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Has not yet responded to any fluid resuscitation
   and is basically anuric at this point.  Renal believes patient will
   need dialysis in the next 48 hours. Given prognosis they would like to
   avoid. Hyperkalemia resolved. Monitor [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Lasix 120mg IV once
   - Calcium gluconate prn ECG changes.
   - Serial ECGs.
   - FU Renal recs
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.  Likely DIC given severity of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] coags and fibrinogen.
   - Check FDP with next draw.
   - Cryo for f'gen < 100; FFP prior to procedures.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   - check d-bili.
   .
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  Respiratory distress reportedly acute onset; would
   be at high risk for PE given malignancy.  Difficulty with CT right now
   given positioning and renal failure, and would be risky to empirically
   heparinize given unknown status re: brain mets or other intracranial
   process.
   - Intubate now.
   - Monitor ABGs closely following intubation as maintaining high
   ventilation/low pCO2 on own and needs this respiratory compensation -
   goal for higher minute ventilations.
   - CT chest non contrast, evaluate effusion. Based on CT would consider
   diagnostic thoracentesis.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Lower voltage, poor RWP compared to prior.  No clear
   elevation in JVD, not tachycardic, and sources other than tamponade
   more likely playing a role in hypotension. TT trending down to 0.08
   today.
   - FU  TTE today.
   ..
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   .
   # FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port, ?need TLC, ?need HD line
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer who presented with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis. She has multiple organ dysfunction including pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS: The patient is at risk for further hypotension and septic shock due to the underlying infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Source possibilities include pulmonary, GI, line infection, urinary, and CNS infection.

2. Metabolic/lactic acidosis: The patient had severe systemic hypoperfusion and hypotension, leading to lactic acidosis with a lactate level of 4.3. This condition needs to be corrected by addressing the underlying causes, such as treating the infection and stabilizing blood pressure.

3. ARF/hyperkalemia: The patient likely has acute renal failure (ARF) caused by hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis. She also has hyperkalemia, which needs to be managed with appropriate treatments like Lasix, calcium gluconate, and monitoring of electrolytes.

4. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient may have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to the severity of infection. Monitoring of coagulation parameters, including fibrin"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Multiple organ dysfunction including
   pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, renal failure.  Source possibilities
   include pulmonary, GI (?could she have perf given abd exam), line
   infection (has port), urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS
   infection (though other sources probably more likely).  Needs
   simultaneous broad spectrum treatment and workup.
   - blood cultures pending.
   - urine culture and UA if voids.
   - Further source workup with imaging following intubation as long as
   stable enough.  Dedicated KUB now vs. waiting until stable.  Likely
   pan-CT once intubated.
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; vanco and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and renal failure as able.
   .
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension.
   - Correct BP.
   - Trend lactate.
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Has not yet responded to any fluid resuscitation
   and is basically anuric at this point.
   - Bicarb gtt.  Additional insulin/D50 if K>6.  Otherwise appears fluids
   not helping UOP; hold off on aggressive IVFs.
   - Calcium gluconate prn ECG changes.
   - Serial ECGs.
   - Renal to see.
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.  Likely DIC given severity of
   infection.
   - Serial coags and fibrinogen.
   - Check FDP with next draw.
   - Cryo for f'gen < 100; FFP prior to procedures.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   - check d-bili.
   .
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  Respiratory distress reportedly acute onset; would
   be at high risk for PE given malignancy.  Difficulty with CT right now
   given positioning and renal failure, and would be risky to empirically
   heparinize given unknown status re: brain mets or other intracranial
   process.
   - Intubate now.
   - Monitor ABGs closely following intubation as maintaining high
   ventilation/low pCO2 on own and needs this respiratory compensation -
   goal for higher minute ventilations.
   - Consider CTA chest (though is with ARF) as above and/or CT head
   noncontrast to rule out bleed/intracranial process.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Lower voltage, poor RWP compared to prior.  No clear
   elevation in JVD, not tachycardic, and sources other than tamponade
   more likely playing a role in hypotension.
   - TTE.
   - Serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes, though not clear that elevated CEs
   would change management.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   .
   # FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port, ?need TLC, ?need HD line
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypotension, multiple organ dysfunction including pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, and renal failure. The source of infection is unclear but possibilities include pulmonary, GI, line infection, urinary, and CNS infection. The patient requires simultaneous broad-spectrum treatment and workup. She has multiple medical complications including metabolic/lactic acidosis, ARF/hyperkalemia, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypoxia and respiratory distress, ECG changes, leukocytosis/bandemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.

2. Metabolic/Lactic Acidosis: The patient has severe systemic hypoperfusion and hypotension, leading to lactic acidosis. Immediate correction of blood pressure and treatment of infection are necessary.

3. ARF/Hyperkalemia: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) due to hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis from sepsis. Hyperkalemia is also present, which can be dangerous and requires careful"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis. She has multiple organ dysfunction including pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS: The patient is experiencing hypotension and septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Immediate broad-spectrum treatment and workup are necessary.

2. Metabolic/lactic acidosis: The patient has severe systemic hypoperfusion and hypotension, resulting in lactic acidosis. It is important to correct blood pressure and monitor lactate levels.

3. ARF/hyperkalemia: The patient likely has acute renal failure (ARF) due to hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis from sepsis. There is hyperkalemia that has resolved. Close monitoring of electrolytes is required.

4. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient may have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given the severity of infection. Monitoring coagulation parameters and providing appropriate interventions, such as cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma, is essential.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating liver involvement. Supportive management of sepsis and careful monitoring are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Multiple organ dysfunction including
   pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, renal failure.  Source possibilities
   include pulmonary, GI (?could she have perf given abd exam), line
   infection (has port), urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS
   infection (though other sources probably more likely).  Needs
   simultaneous broad spectrum treatment and workup.
   - blood cultures pending.
   - urine culture and UA if voids.
   - Further source workup with imaging following intubation as long as
   stable enough.  Dedicated KUB now vs. waiting until stable.  Likely
   pan-CT once intubated.
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; vanco and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and renal failure as able.
   .
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension. Lactate to 4.3  from 10. Acidosis resolved.
   - Correct BP.
   - Trend lactate.
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Has not yet responded to any fluid resuscitation
   and is basically anuric at this point.  Renal believes patient will
   need dialysis in the next 48 hours. Given prognosis they would like to
   avoid. Hyperkalemia resolved. Monitor [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Lasix 120mg IV once
   - Calcium gluconate prn ECG changes.
   - Serial ECGs.
   - FU Renal recs
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.  Likely DIC given severity of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] coags and fibrinogen.
   - Check FDP with next draw.
   - Cryo for f'gen < 100; FFP prior to procedures.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   - check d-bili.
   .
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  Respiratory distress reportedly acute onset; would
   be at high risk for PE given malignancy.  Difficulty with CT right now
   given positioning and renal failure, and would be risky to empirically
   heparinize given unknown status re: brain mets or other intracranial
   process.
   - Intubate now.
   - Monitor ABGs closely following intubation as maintaining high
   ventilation/low pCO2 on own and needs this respiratory compensation -
   goal for higher minute ventilations.
   - CT chest non contrast, evaluate effusion. Based on CT would consider
   diagnostic thoracentesis.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Lower voltage, poor RWP compared to prior.  No clear
   elevation in JVD, not tachycardic, and sources other than tamponade
   more likely playing a role in hypotension. TT trending down to 0.08
   today.
   - FU  TTE today.
   ..
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   .
   # FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port, ?need TLC, ?need HD line
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and multiple organ dysfunction including pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, and renal failure. The source of infection is uncertain but could include pulmonary, gastrointestinal, line infection, urinary, or central nervous system infection. The patient requires simultaneous broad-spectrum treatment and workup.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome): The patient is experiencing septic shock, which can lead to MODS involving multiple organs such as the lungs, heart, blood, liver, and kidneys.

2. Metabolic/lactic acidosis: The patient has severe systemic hypoperfusion and hypotension, leading to lactic acidosis. Correction of acidosis and renal failure as able is necessary.

3. ARF/hyperkalemia: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure due to hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis from sepsis. Hyperkalemia has been observed and may require dialysis.

4. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, possibly due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to the severity of infection.

5. Transaminitis: The patient exhibits transaminitis,"

   with subsequent establishment of hospice, presenting to ED with
   confusion x few days day and shortness of breath.  She had sudden onset
   of shortness of breath today, no chest pain; persistent but unchanged
   abdominal pain.  No recent diarrhea, constipation, N/V.  Husband notes
   patient taking increasing doses of oxycontin (120 mg in 24 hour period
   - twice what is prescribed - unclear if intentional).  No HA, fever,
   cough.

   exam.  Bilateral coarse breath sounds.  Guaiac positive.  2+ edema.
   Patient was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin; calcium gluconate, 1
   gram, D50 and insulin, kayexalate 60 g, and levophed gtt started for
   hypotension.  BPs dipping into 70s even after 3L so levophed gtt
   started (running through port).  BP in upper 90s.  Lab abnls included
   lactate 10, severe metabolic acidosis (bicarb 8, pH 7.24), WBCs 18.8

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, presenting to the ICU with severe septic shock and MODS. She was admitted to the floor with confusion and shortness of breath, and subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs, including hypotension requiring vasopressors, altered mental status, and multiorgan dysfunction. She has a history of allergies to multiple medications, including angioedema, wheezing, hives, swollen lips, and anaphylaxis. The patient's family has been informed about her poor prognosis, and no further anti-neoplastic options are available. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent deterioration indicate acute respiratory failure, which could lead to further hypoxemia and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation suggests severe sepsis progressing to septic shock, characterized by persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. There is a risk of ongoing organ dysfunction and potential death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated lactate levels, hyperkalemia, and oliguria suggest acute kidney injury, which can result in renal failure and the need for dialysis.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status or"

   Family meeting planned for [**2-2**] at 1300.
   Given grave prognosis, family meeting was planned for today at 1 p.m.
   The prognosis will be poor despite any intervention, so we think that
   we will discuss whether dialysis, for example, is warranted.

   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Multiple organ dysfunction including
   pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, renal failure.  Source possibilities
   include pulmonary, GI (?could she have perf given abd exam), line
   infection (has port), urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS
   infection (though other sources probably more likely).  Needs
   simultaneous broad spectrum treatment and workup.
   - blood cultures pending.
   - urine culture and UA if voids.
   - CT torso today.
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and renal failure as able.
   .
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension. Lactate to 4.3  from 10. Acidosis resolved.
   - Correct BP.
   - Trend lactate.
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Has not yet responded to any fluid resuscitation
   and is basically anuric at this point.  Renal believes patient will
   need dialysis in the next 48 hours. Given prognosis they would like to
   avoid. Hyperkalemia resolved. Monitor [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Lasix 120mg IV once
   - Calcium gluconate prn ECG changes.
   - Serial ECGs.
   - FU Renal recs
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.  Likely DIC given severity of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] coags and fibrinogen.
   - Check FDP with next draw.
   - Cryo for f'gen < 100; FFP prior to procedures.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   - check d-bili.
   .
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  Respiratory distress reportedly acute onset; would
   be at high risk for PE given malignancy.  Difficulty with CT right now
   given positioning and renal failure, and would be risky to empirically
   heparinize given unknown status re: brain mets or other intracranial
   process.
   - Intubate now.
   - Monitor ABGs closely following intubation as maintaining high
   ventilation/low pCO2 on own and needs this respiratory compensation -
   goal for higher minute ventilations.
   - CT chest non contrast, evaluate effusion. Based on CT would consider
   diagnostic thoracentesis.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Lower voltage, poor RWP compared to prior.  No clear
   elevation in JVD, not tachycardic, and sources other than tamponade
   more likely playing a role in hypotension. TT trending down to 0.08
   today.
   - FU  TTE today.
   ..
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   .
   # FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port, ?need TLC, ?need HD line
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented to the emergency department with confusion, shortness of breath, and persistent abdominal pain. She was admitted to the MICU for severe septic shock and MODS (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a history of pneumonia. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support her breathing.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has anasarca and ascites, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and other skin complications.

3. Ineffective coping: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may indicate ineffective coping mechanisms due to her underlying medical conditions and treatments.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has hyperkalemia and anuria, suggesting acute renal failure. Dialysis may be required to manage her renal function.

5. Altered mental status: The patient is confused and has an altered level of consciousness. This can be attributed to her sepsis, hypoxia, and other underlying conditions.

6. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and signs of systemic infection suggest septic shock. Aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic support is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Multiple organ dysfunction including
   pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, renal failure.  Source possibilities
   include pulmonary, GI (?could she have perf given abd exam), line
   infection (has port), urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS
   infection (though other sources probably more likely).  Needs
   simultaneous broad spectrum treatment and workup.
   - blood cultures pending.
   - urine culture and UA if voids.
   - CT torso today.
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and renal failure as able.
   .
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension. Lactate to 4.3  from 10. Acidosis resolved.
   - Correct BP.
   - Trend lactate.
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Has not yet responded to any fluid resuscitation
   and is basically anuric at this point.  Renal believes patient will
   need dialysis in the next 48 hours. Given prognosis they would like to
   avoid. Hyperkalemia resolved. Monitor [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Lasix 120mg IV once
   - Calcium gluconate prn ECG changes.
   - Serial ECGs.
   - FU Renal recs
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.  Likely DIC given severity of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] coags and fibrinogen.
   - Check FDP with next draw.
   - Cryo for f'gen < 100; FFP prior to procedures.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   - check d-bili.
   .
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  Respiratory distress reportedly acute onset; would
   be at high risk for PE given malignancy.  Difficulty with CT right now
   given positioning and renal failure, and would be risky to empirically
   heparinize given unknown status re: brain mets or other intracranial
   process.
   - Intubate now.
   - Monitor ABGs closely following intubation as maintaining high
   ventilation/low pCO2 on own and needs this respiratory compensation -
   goal for higher minute ventilations.
   - CT chest non contrast, evaluate effusion. Based on CT would consider
   diagnostic thoracentesis.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Lower voltage, poor RWP compared to prior.  No clear
   elevation in JVD, not tachycardic, and sources other than tamponade
   more likely playing a role in hypotension. TT trending down to 0.08
   today.
   - FU  TTE today.
   ..
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   .
   # FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port, ?need TLC, ?need HD line
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with severe septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's condition is critical, with impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, and renal failure. She requires simultaneous broad-spectrum treatment and workup to address the source of infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and possibly a pulmonary embolism. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support her breathing.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
3. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly. Dialysis may be necessary to support kidney function.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding and thrombotic events. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate intervention are essential.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, likely secondary to shock liver. Supportive management is required to maintain liver function.

   abdominal pain.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 12412**] is a 58 year-old woman with extensive metastases to lung
   and liver from colon cancer.
   Reason for MICU admission: Severe septic shock/MODS
   24 Hour Events:

   LVEF >55%, mild global free wall hypokinesis right ventricle.
   CT TORSO:
Innumerable
 mets to lungs bilaterally, volume loss secondary to
   elevated right hemidiaphragm, no evidence of bowel obstruction (po
   contrast to neoterminal ileum). Significant increase in disease burden
   since [**10-15**] of [**2111**].
   Family meeting planned for [**2-2**] at 1300.
   Given grave prognosis, family meeting was planned for today at 1 p.m.
   The prognosis will be poor despite any intervention, so we think that
   we will discuss whether dialysis, for example, is warranted.
   Oncology Consult
   Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12403**] ([**Numeric Identifier 12404**]) notes no further anti-neoplastic options.
   Onc would advise family as to extremely poor prognosis.

   Will discuss dialysis with us later today after family meeting.

   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   # Family meeting and plan of care
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  No obvious site from which sepsis
   originated.  Multiple organ dysfunction including neurologic impairment
   (delirium to stupor), pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, renal failure.
   Source possibilities include pulmonary, GI, line infection (has port),
   urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS infection (though other
   sources probably more likely).  Needs simultaneous broad spectrum
   treatment and workup. CT significant only for extensive metastatic
   disease. Possible mesenteric ischemia in setting of hypotension,
   resulting in extensive translocation
 await blood culture, Gram stain
   of this and speciation. Cover broadly until then.  Given above
 only
   medical management. Did not tolerate PO polystyrene today.
   - Blood cultures pending
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and sequelae of renal failure by medical
   means.
   - Bicarb for above.
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension. Lactate to 5.3 from 10. Acidosis resolved.
   - Correct BP
   - Trend lactate
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Did not respond to any fluid resuscitation and
   is basically anuric at this point.  Renal believes patient will need
   dialysis in the next 48 hours (they are happy to perform but see that
   the prognosis is grave). After family meeting, decided to forgo
   dialysis. Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia prominent. Monitor [**Hospital1 7**]
   lytes, hold Ca given phosphate. No response to 120 mg IV Lasix last
   night. Polystyrene not tolerated (all recovered from NGT).
   - Bicarb for hyperkalemia
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.
   Likely DIC given severity of infection and very high FDP, but
   fibrinogen presently WNLs.  NTD.
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver. Is improving now.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  RLL atelectic.
   - Continue antibiotics.
   - Monitor ABGs
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above. Continuing to rise.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Continue antibiotic therapy
   # FEN:  Replete electrolytes, NPO for now (based on trial with complete

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with extensive metastases from colon cancer.
- She was admitted to the MICU for severe septic shock and MODS (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome).
- She has a history of recent admission for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
- The patient's current symptoms include confusion, shortness of breath, and nausea.
- She has a poor prognosis, with extensive metastatic disease, including lung and liver involvement.
- She is also experiencing respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, and hypotension.
- The family meeting was planned to discuss the potential futility of medical interventions, including dialysis.
- The patient's medical team believes she will need dialysis in the next 48 hours, but the family has decided to forgo this intervention.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and medical treatment for hyperkalemia.
- Other potential medical complications include pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxia, which could lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, and if not appropriately managed, it can lead to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and if not addressed promptly, it may progress to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. The family has agreed to no high-dose interventions and only medical management. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. There are concerns about the patient's hypocalcemia due to high phosphate levels.

The patient has multiple allergies, including angioedema with lisinopril, wheezing with felodipine, hives with Benadryl, wheezing with iodine, latex allergy, swollen lips with augmentin and levofloxacin, and anaphylaxis with clindamycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 104/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 652 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support is ventilator-dependent.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.0 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 5.3 mmol/L, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: "

Blood Cultures: Pending
   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   # Family meeting and plan of care
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  No obvious site from which sepsis
   originated.  Multiple organ dysfunction including neurologic impairment
   (delirium to stupor), pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, renal failure.
   Source possibilities include pulmonary, GI, line infection (has port),
   urinary (though making minimal urine), CNS infection (though other
   sources probably more likely).  Needs simultaneous broad spectrum
   treatment and workup. CT significant only for extensive metastatic
   disease. Possible mesenteric ischemia in setting of hypotension,
   resulting in extensive translocation
 await blood culture, Gram stain
   of this and speciation. Cover broadly until then.  Given above
 only
   medical management. Did not tolerate PO polystyrene today.
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum and flagyl.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and sequelae of renal failure by medical
   means.
   - Bicarb for above.
   # Metabolic/lactic acidosis.  With severe systemic hypoperfusion and
   hypotension. Lactate to 5.3 from 10. Acidosis resolved.
   - Correct BP
   - Trend lactate
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   # ARF/hyperkalemia.  Likely hypotension induced ATN from sepsis.  No
   known offending meds.  Did not respond to any fluid resuscitation and
   is basically anuric at this point.  Renal believes patient will need
   dialysis in the next 48 hours (they are happy to perform but see that
   the prognosis is grave). After family meeting, decided to forgo
   dialysis. Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia prominent. Monitor [**Hospital1 7**]
   lytes, hold Ca given phosphate. No response to 120 mg IV Lasix last
   night. Polystyrene not tolerated (all recovered from NGT). Poor
   response to kayexalate [**2-2**].
   - Bicarb for Hyperkalemia
   - DC
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.
   Likely DIC given severity of infection and very high FDP, but
   fibrinogen presently WNLs.  NTD.
   - Transfuse platlets when <10 or if bleeds.
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver. Is improving now.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  RLL atelectic.
   - Continue antibiotics.
   - Monitor ABGs
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above. Continuing to rise.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Continue antibiotic therapy
   # FEN:  Replete electrolytes, NPO for now (based on trial with complete
   suction of stomach contents)
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

- Temperature: 36.8 C (98.2 F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (86-104)
- Blood pressure: 104/55 mmHg (69/83-116/62)
- Respiratory rate: 12 insp/min (11-22)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CPAP/PSV, set at a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory support device is an endotracheal tube.

Laboratory results show:

- White blood cell count (WBC): 21.7 - 27.0 K/uL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 33.3 - 34.4%
- Platelet count (Plt): 101 - 40 K/uL
- Creatinine (Cr): 3.9 - 4.1 mg/dL
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 100 mEq/L
- Sodium (Na+): 136 mEq/L
- Potassium (K+): 4.1 - 5.8 mEq/L
- Chloride (Cl-): 98 mEq/L
- Calcium (Ca++): 7.2 mg/dL
- Magnesium (Mg++): 2.8 mg/dL
- Phosphate (PO4): 6.9 mg/dL
- Glucose: 180 mg/dL
- Lactic acid: 5.3 mmol/L
- Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
- LDH: [**Numeric Identifier 12384**] IU/L

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are:

- pH: 7.44
- PaCO2: 30 mmHg
- HCO3: 81 mmol/L
- Base excess: -1
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): 203
- Respiratory rate (RR): 17 breaths per minute

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Lisinopril, Felodipine, Benadryl, Iodine, Latex, Augmentin, Clindamycin, and Sulfa. The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl bolus, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, flagyl, levophed, bicarb, and Lasix.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise for the patient include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection triggers an overwhelming immune response.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has severe metabolic acidosis, as indicated by a low pH and high lactate levels. This condition can be life-threatening and requires immediate treatment.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine and BUN levels, indicating possible renal dysfunction. This can lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and there is evidence of pneumonia on the right side. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and the need for further respiratory support.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia and elevated fibrin degradation products (FDP), suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This condition increases the risk of bleeding and clotting complications.

6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   # Family meeting and plan of care:
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Most likely pulmonary source given
   positive sputum culture and evidence of right sided pneumonia. Pt
   pressures stable with low dose of levophed, has not tolerated dc
   pressures, given sedating medications.   No HD per family request.
   Shock liver resolving. Afebrile at this time.
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum,  flagyl,
   vancomycin dosed per level.  Will consider narrowing coveage for MSSA
   tomorrow.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and sequelae of renal failure by medical
   means.
   - Bicarb for above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia. ATN secondary to hyopotension.  Creatinine stable.
   Persistent hyperkalemia without EKG changes. No bm so unable to use
   kayexalate.
   - Bicarb for Hyperkalemia
   - Daily lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.
   Likely DIC given severity of infection and very high FDP, but
   fibrinogen presently WNLs.  NTD.
   - Consider transfusion of  platelets when <10 or if bleeds.
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver. Is improving now.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  RLL atelectic. Afebrile. Will discuss with family
   extubation. Currently, patient tolerating minimal pressure support.
   - Continue antibiotics.
   - Family meeting re: extubation (awaiting out
[**Location 12454**]family)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above. Stable.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Continue antibiotic therapy. Narrow as above.
   # FEN:  Replete electrolytes, NPO for now (based on trial with complete
   suction of stomach contents)
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and hyperkalemia. The patient's family has requested medical treatment without invasive measures, specifically no dialysis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 mmHg to 129/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 24.1 to 27.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 40 to 79 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 3.9 to 4.3 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient also has an electrolyte imbalance with hyperkalemia.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications. The patient has septic shock likely due to a pulmonary source, as evidenced by a positive sputum culture and evidence of right-sided pneumonia. The patient is currently stable on low-dose norepinephrine (Levophed), but has not tolerated discontinuation of the medication. The patient's family has declined hemodialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer who presented with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hyperkalemia. The family wishes to continue medical treatment without invasive measures such as dialysis. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with septic shock suggests an ongoing infection, which could lead to further complications if not effectively managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has signs of ARF, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and hyperkalemia. This may worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient's cancer is widely metastatic, which means it has spread to other parts of the body. This could lead to additional complications related to cancer progression.
4. Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to severe infection. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires ongoing management with pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Extubation may be considered once the patient's condition improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer,
   presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF,
   hyperkalemia.
   # Family meeting and plan of care:
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Most likely pulmonary source given
   positive sputum culture and evidence of right sided pneumonia. Pt
   pressures stable with low dose of levophed, has not tolerated dc
   pressures, given sedating medications.   No HD per family request.
   Shock liver resolving. Afebrile at this time.
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum,  flagyl,
   vancomycin dosed per level.  Will consider narrowing coveage for MSSA
   tomorrow.
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Correction of acidosis and sequelae of renal failure by medical
   means.
   - Bicarb for above.
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia. ATN secondary to hyopotension.  Creatinine stable.
   Persistent hyperkalemia without EKG changes. No bm so unable to use
   kayexalate.
   - Bicarb for Hyperkalemia
   - Daily lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.
   Likely DIC given severity of infection and very high FDP, but
   fibrinogen presently WNLs.  NTD.
   - Consider transfusion of  platelets when <10 or if bleeds.
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver. Is improving now.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Evidence of pneumonia on right.
   Also with wheezes.  RLL atelectic. Afebrile. Will discuss with family
   extubation. Currently, patient tolerating minimal pressure support.
   - Continue antibiotics.
   - Family meeting re: extubation (awaiting out
[**Location 12454**]family)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above. Stable.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Continue antibiotic therapy. Narrow as above.
   # FEN:  Replete electrolytes, NPO for now (based on trial with complete
   suction of stomach contents)
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port
   # Communication: husband

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and hyperkalemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS: The patient is experiencing hypotension and septic shock, which can lead to Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). This is likely due to a pulmonary source given the positive sputum culture and evidence of right-sided pneumonia.

2. ARF/hyperkalemia: The patient has acute renal failure, which is secondary to hypotension. This has resulted in persistent hyperkalemia without EKG changes. 

3. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient is likely experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to the severity of infection and high fibrin degradation products (FDP), although the fibrinogen levels are currently within normal limits.

4. Transaminitis: The patient is showing signs of transaminitis, which is likely due to shock liver. It is improving now.

5. Hypoxia and respiratory distress: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on the right side, along with wheezes and right lower lobe atelectasis. Currently, the patient is tolerating minimal pressure support.

6. Leukocytosis/band"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 58F metastatic colon ca c/b shock/MOSF.
   CT with diffuse lung and liver infiltration. Per recent family mtg, we
   continue support at current level, but will not escalate (no HD, no
   CPR).  Placed back on pressors this am, now weaning.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.5  BP 92/51  HR 101  RR 13 with sat 97 on PSV
   [**6-8**]  0.4. Obese F, eyes open but unable to follow commands. coarse BS,
   decreased bb, RRR s1s2. tachy, Firm, distended, w/o BS. 4+ edema,
   grimace to movement/palpation of R leg.
   Labs notable for WBC 27K, HCT 34, plt 39, K+ 5.1, na 139, Cr 4.5.
   No new micro data.  CXR reviewed--clight increase in volume loss on R,
   elevated R hemid, cardiac shift, no new focal findings.
   Agree with plan to continue current level of supportive care for MOSF
   in the setting of widely metastatic colon cancer and sepsis.
   She contintue to have a profound leukocytosis, ? c diff, leukemoid rx,
   inflammtion, abscess.  We continue abx, given high risk for
   bowel translocation in setting of gastric outlet vs. bowel obstruction,
   also covering c diff, pressors to maintain MAPS > 65 weaning as able,
   bowel rest. Follow lactate level.  Recx and f/u pending data.  As pt
   grimaces to touch, would continue fentanyl for pain control, increase
   for comfort, understanding that this will further impact MS and ability
   to interact with family.  Her thrombocytopenia remains stable. No
   current evidence of active bleeding.  Is likely multifactorial from
   sepsis/ liver failure/ possible marrow involvement from advanced
   malignancy.  Her creatinine continues to increase and urine outpt
   decreasing. Patient is DNR.  She is not improving despite aggressive
   supportive care and has no further oncologic treatment options
   available. HD would not be a brindge to recovery. We continue to
   communicate with family and discuss possible transition
   to terminal extubation and  CMO.  Palliative care c/s is following.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
   Addendum:
   I met with pt's family and updated them to her current
   condition. Family friend, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1296**] was also present.  Family
   understands that pt remains critically ill on life support , that she
   is not improving despite our aggressive care and that we are limited in
   terms of treatment options regarding her advanced malignancy and organ
   failure.  Family had many questions about transition to CMO, which were
   discussed in detail  At this time, family is not ready to change goals
   of care towrad  comfort and we continue with current level of care.
   Additional time spent in family meeting:  45 min

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis. She has acute kidney injury (ARF) and is experiencing hyperkalemia. The patient's family wishes to forgo invasive measures such as dialysis, but they agree to continue with antibiotics, pressors for blood pressure support, and medical treatment for hyperkalemia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. 

Her physical examination reveals bilateral rhonchi, decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe, tachycardia, no murmurs or gallops, and abdominal distention without bowel sounds. Neurologically, the patient does not respond to commands and grimaces to pain.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24.1-27.0 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 32.9-34.4%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39-79 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels of 3.9-4.5 mg/dL. Other lab abnormalities include hyperkalemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock
   and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF, hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Family meeting and plan of care:
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- Further discussion regarding extubation today
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Most likely pulmonary source given
   positive sputum culture and evidence of right sided pneumonia. Off
   pressors for some time yesterday, required pressures to be restarted
   this AM.   No HD per family request. Shock liver resolving. Afebrile at
   this time.
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Double GNR coverage with cefepime, cipro; meropenum,  flagyl,
   vancomycin dosed per level.  Will consider narrowing coverage once
   decision is made regarding
   - Levophed, titrate as needed.
   - Bolus fluids PRN
   .
   # Abdominal Distention: Likely gastric outlet vs. SBO.
   -          NPO
   -          Hold TF
   -          NO KUB at this time
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia. ATN secondary to hyopotension.  Creatinine stable.
   Persistent hyperkalemia without EKG changes. No bm so unable to use
   kayexalate.
   - Bicarb for Hyperkalemia
   - Daily lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.
   Likely DIC given severity of infection and very high FDP, but
   fibrinogen presently WNLs.  NTD.
   - Consider transfusion of  platelets when <10 or if bleeds.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver. Is improving now.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Stable on pressure support.
   - Continue antibiotics.
   - Family meeting re: extubation (awaiting out
[**Location 12454**]family)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/bandemia.  With sepsis as above. Stable.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Continue antibiotic therapy. Narrow as above.
   .
   # FEN:  Replete electrolytes, NPO for now (based on trial with complete
   suction of stomach contents)
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH given coagulopathy; boots
   # Access: peripherals, port
   # Communication: husband
   # Code:  Full - discussed with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] was hospice care at
   home with cutting down all meds.  Clearly current aggressive plans not
   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has multi-organ failure, sepsis, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and metastatic colon cancer.
- The patient's family is gradually becoming accustomed to the prognosis and does not want invasive measures such as dialysis.
- The patient experienced agitation overnight and required Versed for sedation.
- The patient's arterial line (A-line) is having poor patency, and it may need to be rewired or replaced.
- The patient passed a bowel movement overnight.
- The patient has several allergies, including angioedema with Lisinopril, hives with iodine, wheezing with Benadryl and Levofloxacin, swollen lips with Augmentin, and anaphylaxis with Clindamycin.
- The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, and Meropenem.
- The patient is receiving infusions of Fentanyl and Norepinephrine.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, decreased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation.
- The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive total input of 1,312 mL and output of 1,182 mL via IVF, with urine output of 55 mL.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with bilateral rh"

   58F with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock
   and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF, hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Family meeting and plan of care:
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- Further discussion regarding extubation today
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Most likely pulmonary source given
   positive sputum culture and evidence of right sided pneumonia. Off
   pressors for some time yesterday, required pressures to be restarted
   this AM.   No HD per family request. Shock liver resolving. Afebrile at
   this time.
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Double GNR coverage with cipro; meropenum, flagyl (for empiric C.
   diff coverage), vancomycin dosed per level.  Will consider narrowing
   coverage once decision is made regarding
   - Levophed, titrate as needed. Can add vasopressin if needed.
   - Bolus fluids PRN
   - Follow ABGs, lactate to assess acidosis

   # Abdominal Distention: Likely gastric outlet vs. SBO vs ileus.
   -          NPO
   -          Hold TF
   .
   # ARF/hyperkalemia. ATN secondary to hyopotension.  Creatinine stable.
   Persistent hyperkalemia without EKG changes. No bm so unable to use
   kayexalate.
   - Bicarb for Hyperkalemia
   - Daily lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.
   Likely DIC given severity of infection and very high FDP, but
   fibrinogen presently WNLs.  NTD.
   - Consider transfusion of platelets when <10 or if bleeds.
   - Will give Vit K 10mg IV.
   .
   # Transaminitis.  Likely shock liver. Is improving now.
   - Support BP and management of sepsis as above.

   in line with this, but husband hopeful despite very poor current (and
   longterm) prognosis.  He is still actively looking for alternative
   treatments for cancer.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock, severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and hyperkalemia. The patient's family wishes to continue medical treatment without invasive measures such as dialysis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS: The patient is experiencing hypotension and septic shock, which may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure and treat the underlying infection.

2. Abdominal Distention: The patient has abdominal distention, which could be due to gastric outlet obstruction, small bowel obstruction, or ileus. It is important to keep the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) and hold tube feedings.

3. ARF/hyperkalemia: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to hypotension. Hyperkalemia is persistent despite medical management. It is important to monitor potassium levels and provide appropriate treatment for hyperkalemia.

4. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. This may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer who is currently in the ICU due to septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis. She has acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hypotension, abdominal distention, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient's family wishes to continue medical treatment without invasive measures such as dialysis. The attending physician notes that the patient requires additional access for ongoing medical treatment and will address this with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute kidney injury, which may worsen if not managed properly. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not treated effectively.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels need to be carefully managed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion may be required if the"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 58F metastatic colon ca c/b shock/MOSF.
   CT with diffuse lung and liver infiltration. We continue support at
   current level,  w/o escalate (no HD, no CPR).  . Ongoing meetings with
   family regarding goals of care.  She remains on pressors, anuric.
   A-line no longer functioning --> pulled.  No longer able to draw from
   port.  ST changes on ecg.  Trop 0.04.  No HD change.
   Exam notable for AF  BP 120/60  HR 110 RR 16 with sat 98% on PSV  [**6-8**]
   0.4. Obese F, eyes open but unable to follow commands, coarse BS,
   decreased bb, RRR s1s2. tachy, firm, remains distended, absent BS. 4+
   edema, gross anasarca

   CXR--rotated, no obvious change, diffuse mets, sm effusion, r hemid
   elevation
   Agree with plan to continue current level of supportive care for MOSF
   in the setting of widely metastatic colon cancer and sepsis. She is not
   improving despite aggressive supportive care and has no further
   oncologic treatment options available.Given grim prognosis and limited
   treatment options, we continue to communicate with family and discuss
   possible transition to terminal extubation and [**Month/Day (1) 580**].   She remains AF
   but continues to have a profound leukocytosis--? c diff, leukemoid rx,
   inflammation, abscess.  We continue empiric broad abx given high risk
   for bowel translocation in setting of ? GOO vs. ileus, also covering c
   diff.  She remains on bowel rest.  We continue pressors to maintain
   MAPS > 60, weaning as able, but if necessary to add second [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   use vasopressin.  Continue fentanyl for pain control, increase as
   needed for comfort.  Her thrombocytopenia remains essentially stable.
   There is no current evidence of active bleeding.  Is
   likely multifactorial from sepsis/ liver failure/ possible
   marrow involvement from advanced malignancy.   Coagulopathy also likely
   from liver involvement and nutritional deficiency.  S/p vit K.  She
   remains in ARF, anuric, HD would not be a bridge to recovery. Will
   medically manage if has recurrent hyperkalemia as able, follow ecg.  In
   terms of resp failure, although her RSBI is low, volume ol, extensive
   lung mets, and limited MS all are barriers to extubation at this time,
   as we continue to address goals of care / possible terminal
   extubation. Will d/w family replacing a-line if we will continue this
   level of care, as access now more limited. Patient is DNR.  Palliative
   care c/s is following.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2112-2-6**] 07:40 PM
   - Again addressed goals of care with family.  Still not ready to make
   pt [**Name (NI) 580**], as husband wants to contact rest of pt's family.  Will consider
   withdrawing care in [**3-9**] days, if no significant improvement.  Do not
   want any escalation of care (e.g. resuscitation), but OK to add another
   pressor if needed.
   - Given pt's elevated potassium (5.7) this am, obtained ECG, which
   showed sinus tachycardia at 120 as well as 0.5mm ST elevation in V1 and
   V2 w. depressions in V5/V6.  No peaked Ts. Obtained CEs (trending down,
   trop 0.04 from 0.08) and gave ASA.
   - Pt's A-line is no longer working (now pulled) and cannot draw from
   Port, although pt is receiving medications/pressors through port.  Will
   need to address this with the family, and either place new A-line or
   central access for labs.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 58F metastatic colon ca c/b shock/MOSF.
   CT with diffuse lung and liver infiltration. We continue support at
   current level,  w/o escalate (no HD, no CPR).  . Ongoing meetings with
   family regarding goals of care.  She remains on pressors, anuric.
   A-line no longer functioning --> pulled.  No longer able to draw from
   port.  ST changes on ecg.  Trop 0.04.  No HD change.
   Exam notable for AF  BP 120/60  HR 110 RR 16 with sat 98% on PSV  [**6-8**]
   0.4. Obese F, eyes open but unable to follow commands, coarse BS,
   decreased bb, RRR s1s2. tachy, firm, remains distended, absent BS. 4+
   edema, gross anasarca
   Labs notable for WBC 36.5K, HCT 36, plt 61, K+ 4.5, na 135, Cr 3.6, bun
   74, trop 0.04, 7.40/27/88
   CXR--rotated, no obvious change, diffuse mets, sm effusion, r hemid
   elevation
   Agree with plan to continue current level of supportive care for MOSF
   in the setting of widely metastatic colon cancer and sepsis. She is not
   improving despite aggressive supportive care and has no further
   oncologic treatment options available.Given grim prognosis and limited
   treatment options, we continue to communicate with family and discuss
   possible transition to terminal extubation and [**Month/Day (1) 580**].   She remains AF
   but continues to have a profound leukocytosis--? c diff, leukemoid rx,
   inflammation, abscess.  We continue empiric broad abx given high risk
   for bowel translocation in setting of ? GOO vs. ileus, also covering c
   diff.  She remains on bowel rest.  We continue pressors to maintain
   MAPS > 60, weaning as able, but if necessary to add second [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   use vasopressin.  Continue fentanyl for pain control, increase as
   needed for comfort.  Her thrombocytopenia remains essentially stable.
   There is no current evidence of active bleeding.  Is
   likely multifactorial from sepsis/ liver failure/ possible
   marrow involvement from advanced malignancy.   Coagulopathy also likely
   from liver involvement and nutritional deficiency.  S/p vit K.  She
   remains in ARF, anuric, HD would not be a bridge to recovery. Will
   medically manage if has recurrent hyperkalemia as able, follow ecg.  In
   terms of resp failure, although her RSBI is low, volume ol, extensive
   lung mets, and limited MS all are barriers to extubation at this time,
   as we continue to address goals of care / possible terminal
   extubation. Will d/w family replacing a-line if we will continue this
   level of care, as access now more limited. Patient is DNR.  Palliative
   care c/s is following.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis. She is currently intubated and sedated, and her vital signs are stable on pressure support. The patient's family has requested no invasive measures, including dialysis, but wants to continue medical treatment such as antibiotics and pressors. The attending physician agrees with the assessment and plan, emphasizing the need for ongoing support without escalation (no HD, no CPR). The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are likely due to sepsis, liver failure, and possible marrow involvement from advanced malignancy. She remains in ARF, anuric, and has persistent hyperkalemia. The family has decided to focus on aggressive comfort measures with terminal extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has severe metabolic acidosis, which can progress to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a low respiratory system resistance and compliance index (RSBI), indicating difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and has acute renal failure (ARF), which may require"

   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**2112-2-6**] 07:40 PM
   - Again addressed goals of care with family.  Still not ready to make
   pt [**Name (NI) 580**], as husband wants to contact rest of pt's family.  Will consider
   withdrawing care in [**3-9**] days, if no significant improvement.  Do not
   want any escalation of care (e.g. resuscitation), but OK to add another
   pressor if needed.
   - Given pt's elevated potassium (5.7) this am, obtained ECG, which
   showed sinus tachycardia at 120 as well as 0.5mm ST elevation in V1 and
   V2 w. depressions in V5/V6.  No peaked Ts. Obtained CEs (trending down,
   trop 0.04 from 0.08) and gave ASA.
   - Pt's A-line is no longer working (now pulled) and cannot draw from
   Port, although pt is receiving medications/pressors through port.  Will
   need to address this with the family, and either place new A-line or
   central access for labs.

   # Family meeting and plan of care:
   The family wants medical treatment without invasive measures.  The
   measures that they wish to forgo include dialysis.  The measures to
   continue include pressors, medical treatment of hyperkalemia,
   antibiotics. Please see Attending note for further detail.
   -- No dialysis
   -- Continue antibiotics, pressors, medical treatment.
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.  Most likely pulmonary source given
   positive sputum culture and evidence of right sided pneumonia. Off
   pressors for some time yesterday, required pressures to be restarted
   this AM.   No HD per family request. Shock liver resolving. Afebrile at
   this time.
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Double GNR coverage with cipro; meropenum, flagyl (for empiric C.
   diff coverage), vancomycin dosed per level.  Will consider narrowing
   coverage once decision is made regarding
   - Levophed, titrate as needed. Can add vasopressin if needed.
   - Bolus fluids PRN
   - Follow ABGs, lactate to assess acidosis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and hyperkalemia. The patient's family has expressed their desire to continue medical treatment without invasive measures, such as dialysis. The patient's condition requires ongoing management for hypotension, ARF/hyperkalemia, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypoxia, leukocytosis/bandemia, and feeding/parenteral nutrition. The patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm with minimal ST elevation in V1 and V2, and reciprocal depressions in V5 and V6. Imaging reveals an elevated hemidiaphragm, numerous metastases, and increased left effusion. Microbiology reports MSSA in sputum. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/60 to 146/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition remains critical, and the medical team continues to monitor and treat accordingly."
