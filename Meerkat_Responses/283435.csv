   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 yoM w/ a h/o severe dementia, CAD, CHF, PVD who presents
   with severe anemia and hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # ANEMIA: Patient with sudden drop in HCT without any known source. CT
   not compatible with bleeding in lungs, abdomen or pelvis. Patient has
   not had any bowel movement, which would suggest massive bleeding into
   the GI tract. Non-optimal EGD showed a small ulcer in stomach, which
   may be compatible with HGT. No clear source of bleeding found out.
   However, HCT bumped approximately after transfusions.
   -          Check HCT q6 hours
   -          Two large bore IVs
   -          FFPs goal INR <1.8
   -          Vitamin K per NGT 10mg
   # RENAL FAILURE: Patient with increase in creatinine, which may be
   pre-renal renal failure due to hypotension and anemia; however it may
   be ATN in setting of ischemia.
   -          UA with reflex looking for casts
   -          Urine lytes
   -          Manage BP and HCT
   # MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Patient intubated for airway protection. Now
   improved ventilatory settings. There may be a component of aspiration
   and in the top of known pulmonary pneumoconiosis with stable pulmonary
   masses since [**2183**].
   -          Wean sedation
   -          Switch to PS
   -          ABGs afterwards
   -          SBT if doing ok
   -          Continue Vanc/Levo/Flagyl ([**1-15**]) for aspiration PNA
   # FEN:  NPO for now, electrolyte repletion scales

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of severe dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presents with severe anemia and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been given multiple blood transfusions, but his hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has not improved significantly. There is no known source of bleeding, but a small ulcer in the stomach was found during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 131/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's severe anemia and lack of response to blood transfusions may indicate an underlying condition causing continued blood loss or ineffective erythropoiesis. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the anemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions may be due to factors such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or significant blood loss. Monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of severe dementia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presented with severe anemia and hypotension secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been stabilized and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's anemia is thought to be due to gastrointestinal bleeding. He has already received several units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and continues to be stable. Monitoring of hematocrit (hct) every 8 hours will be done today, and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be planned if hct drops.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has an increased creatinine level on admission, indicating renal dysfunction. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.4%, suggesting a pre-renal cause. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is likely due to hypovolemia and ischemia. Maintenance fluids and bolus administration of intravenous fluids will be given to maintain urine output (UOP) at 30cc/hr. Blood pressure and hematocrit levels will also be managed.
3. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection. He has known pulmonary pneumoconiosis with stable nodules/masses followed since 1983. There is also a question of aspiration pneumonia on admission,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of severe dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who presented with severe anemia and hypotension secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently stable after receiving multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's vital signs are within normal range, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and a saturation of oxygen (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an increased creatinine level on admission, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia/ischemia. Fluid resuscitation and close monitoring of urine output (UOP) have been initiated. The patient also has evidence of chronic lung disease, with stable nodules/masses noted on imaging since [**2183**]. There is a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) on admission, which is being covered with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient has left arm edema, which raises concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an ultrasound (US) is planned today. The patient's nutritional status is being assessed, and he is receiving dextrose 5% in water (D5NS) at a rate of 125 mL/hr. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on full support in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yoM w/ a h/o severe dementia, CAD, CHF, PVD who presents with severe
   anemia and hypotension secondary to GI bleed.
   .
   Plan:
   # ANEMIA: Thought to be due to GI bleed. On [**Name (NI) 5579**] pt found to have ulcer
   but not actively bleeding. Yesterday hematocrit bumped appropriately
   with several units of PRBCs and continues to be stable. Will continue
   to monitor hct q8 hours today and plan for repeat EGD later in
   admission if hct drops.
   -          Two large bore IVs
   -          FFPs goal INR <1.8
   -          Vitamin K per NGT 10mg
   -          Transfuse for hct<25
   # RENAL FAILURE: Patient with increase in creatinine on admission, FeNa
   0.4% suggests pre-renal etiology.  Likely ATN  given
   hypovolemia/ischemia. Started on maintenance fluids and bolused for low
   UOP. UA with reflex looking for casts
   -          IVF to maintain UOP 30cc/hr, bolus prn
   -          Manage BP and HCT
   # MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Patient initially intubated for airway
   protection. Known pulmonary pneumoconiosis with stable nodules/masses
   followed since [**2183**] on imaging. There is also question of aspiration
   PNA on admission, which is being covered with vanco/levo/flagyl.
   Currently on MMV, attempted PS wean yesterday but becames apneic. Will
   attempt to decrease sedation and continue to wean with plan to extubate
   later today is tolerates PS. Last ABG 7.33/49/106 on FIO2 40%.
   Wean sedation
   -          Switch to PS
   -          Follow ABGs
   -          SBT if doing ok
   -          Continue Vanc/Levo/Flagyl ([**2-13**]) for aspiration PNA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of severe dementia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presented with severe anemia and hypotension secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been appropriately transfused with several units of packed red blood cells and continues to be stable. The plan is to monitor hematocrit every 8 hours today and plan for a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) later in the admission if hematocrit drops.

The patient has an increased creatinine on admission, suggesting pre-renal etiology likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypovolemia/ischemia. He is started on maintenance fluids and bolused for low urine output. A urinalysis with reflex is being done to look for casts.

The patient was initially intubated for airway protection. He has known pulmonary pneumoconiosis with stable nodules/masses followed since 2183 on imaging. There is also a question of aspiration pneumonia on admission, which is being covered with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl. The patient is currently on mandatory minimal ventilation (MMV), attempted pressure support (PS) wean yesterday but became apneic. The plan is to decrease sedation, continue to wean with the goal of extubation later today if he tolerates PS.

   89 yo male with presentation with anemia and described coffee ground
   material from stomach in the setting of anti-coagulation and
   anti-platelet agents but without active bleeding seen at EGD or based
   upon follow up lab evaluations.  His respiratory failure in the setting
   of GIB and altered mental status has now been reversed.  His original
   insult remains poorly defined but would be best characterized by
   altered mental status, respiratory distress/hypoxemia suggested and
   evidence of UGIB found following NGT placement after intubation
   1)GI Bleed
may be chronic loss
   -PPI
   -HCT q8 hours
   -Maintain IV access
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -NPO reasonable and would not return to feeds without speech and
   swallow evaluation
   -Repeat CXR post extubation
   -Vanco/CTX/Flagyl for possible aspiraiton PNA
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Will need to re-confirm baseline function and follow exam off sedation
   today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a presentation of anemia and coffee ground material from the stomach, in the setting of anticoagulation and anti-platelet agents. The patient has been treated for respiratory failure due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and altered mental status, which has now been reversed. The patient's original insult remains poorly defined but is characterized by altered mental status, respiratory distress/hypoxemia, and evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) found following nasogastric tube (NGT) placement after intubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. GI Bleed: The patient may continue to experience chronic loss of blood, leading to further anemia and potential complications such as hypotension and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience difficulty weaning off oxygen and may require continued respiratory support. There is also a risk of aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's baseline mental function needs to be reconfirmed and evaluated further to determine the underlying cause of the altered mental status. Sedation should be carefully managed to assess the patient's true neurological status.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration and to address each of these potential complications promptly to ensure the best possible outcome."

   # ANEMIA/GIB: Thought to be due to GI bleed. On [**Name (NI) 5579**] pt found to have
   ulcer but not actively bleeding. Crit responded appropriately to RBC
   transfusion. Will continue to monitor hct q8 hours today and plan for
   repeat EGD later in admission if hct drops. Got PO and subQ vitamin K
   -          Two large bore IVs
   -          FFPs goal INR <1.8, currently INR 1.7
   -          Transfuse for hct<25
   # RENAL FAILURE: Patient with increase in creatinine on admission, FeNa
   0.4% suggests pre-renal etiology.  Likely ATN  given
   hypovolemia/ischemia. Started on maintenance fluids and bolused for low
   UOP. UA with reflex looking for casts
   - UA with trace Leukocytes, trace protein
   - Urine sediment with 2 RBCs, 7 WBCs (elevated), 5 hyaline casts, 3
   broad casts
   - as creatinine still elevated, will order renal ultrasound this
   morning
   # Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated for airway protection
   now s/p extubation yesterday. Known pulmonary pneumoconiosis with
   stable nodules/masses followed since [**2183**] on imaging. There is also
   question of aspiration PNA on admission, which is being covered with
   vanco/levo/flagyl. now on shovel mask 40% FIO2 and SO2 of 100%.
   - failed speech and swallow eval now s/p NG tube insertion and patient
   pulled out, will require repeat - consider how going to get nutrition
   long term if aspiration risk
   -   Continue Vanc/Levo/Flagyl ([**3-16**]) for aspiration PNA
   -   Monitor O2 requirement today, may need CPAP
   # L ARM EDEMA: Concern for DVT.
   -LUE ultrasound - PRELIM read - Nonocclusive thrombus within one of the
   paired left brachial veins.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, severe dementia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with severe anemia and hypotension, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to airway protection but was recently extubated. He has a nonocclusive thrombus in one of his left brachial veins and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's renal function is impaired, and there are concerns about his nutritional needs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's failure in speech and swallow evaluation increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia, for which he is currently being treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has left arm edema, and an ultrasound showed a nonocclusive thrombus in one of the paired left brachial veins. This could potentially lead to a DVT.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's severe anemia and hypotension are likely due to GI bleeding. There is an ulcer present but not actively bleeding. Continuous monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary, and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be planned if the hemoglobin drops.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has an"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, severe dementia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with severe anemia and hypotension, which are secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient had an ulcer but was not actively bleeding at the time of detection.

The plan includes monitoring hematocrit levels every 8 hours and planning for a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) later in the admission if the hematocrit drops. The patient has received blood transfusions and is being given PO and subQ vitamin K.

The patient also has renal failure, with an increase in creatinine on admission. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.4%, suggesting pre-renal etiology. It is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypovolemia/ischemia. The patient is being started on maintenance fluids and bolused for low urine output. A renal ultrasound has been ordered.

Regarding the respiratory condition, the patient was initially intubated for airway protection and is now post-extubation. He has known pulmonary pneumoconiosis with stable nodules/masses followed since [**2183**] on imaging. There is also a question of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) on admission,"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo male admitted with altered mental status and intubated in the
   setting of agitation, desaturaiton with difficult to obtain O2
   saturaiton and subsequent GIB seen without evidence of active
   bleeding.  He has been successfully extubated and now returned to room
   air breathing and he has been able to maintain adequate oxygenation and
   ventilation with npo status maintained.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   CTX/Azithro/Flagyl
   -Significant volume overload suggested on CXR this morning with
   hydrostatic edeme resulting
   -Diuresis today
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Persistent impaired renal function without resolution
   -Continue with negative fluid balance given the concern with pulmonary
   findings
   -Will need to maintain MAP
   -Will check renal ultrasound
   3)GI Bleed-
   -PPI
   -GI to follow up endoscopy
   4)Alteration of Awareness-
   -Patient near baseline level of function and much improved over report
   of initial presenation
   -Continue to Rx for primary pulmonary infection
   4)
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will need feeding tube for safe enteral feeds and will
   maintian npo until that can be established.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted with altered mental status and intubated due to agitation, desaturation, and subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). He has been successfully extubated and is now breathing room air, maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, GI bleed, and alteration of awareness. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, especially since he has shown improvement in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The prescribed antibiotics and diuretics will help manage the pulmonary findings and volume overload.

2. Acute Renal Failure: Given the persistent impaired renal function, it is important to continue with a negative fluid balance to address the concern with pulmonary findings. Maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) is crucial, and a renal ultrasound will be necessary for further evaluation.

3. GI Bleed: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been initiated, and a follow-up endoscopy will be required to assess and manage the GI bleed.

4. Alteration of Awareness: The patient's near baseline level of function and improvement over initial presentation indicate a positive trend. Continuing treatment for the primary pulmonary infection and monitoring the patient's mental status are essential.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient will require a feeding tube for safe enteral feeds and will maintain NPO status until that can be established.
