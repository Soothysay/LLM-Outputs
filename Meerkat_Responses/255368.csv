   24 Hour Events:
   -Hepatology agreed that this is gleevec hepatotoxicity, so this was
   discontinued
   -Onc feels less convinced about gleevec hepatotox, (not sure if they
   know hepatology's assessment).  They have low suspicion for tumor lysis
   syndrome, but recommended starting allopurinol.

   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations now presents with
   nausea/vomiting and lactic acidosis with encephalopathy and liver
   failure.
   # Liver Failure: Differential remains broad including most likely
   Gleevec toxicity per hepatology. Other potential etiologies include
   tumor burden, shock liver (unlikely given stable BP), alcohol but
   patient has no h/o etoh, other medication vs. non viral hepatitis ( in
   [**2-29**] negative Hep C and Hep B surface ab postive for immunity). Also,
   pt is  alpha-1-antitrypsin was positive in [**2-29**].
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -holding gleevac

   # Nausea/Vomiting. Increasing today, unable to take Pos
   -          KUB
   -          Change meds to IV for now, pr lactulose
   # Leukocytosis: Remains elevated at ~18, has been persistently elevated
   over last admission. Patient with C.diff on treatment however no
   evidence of other infectious etiology. continue to cover broadly while
   culture are pending. Likely inflammatory response to turmor burden vs.
   liver failure. Also with h/o multiple infections in past including
   C.diff, [**Female First Name (un) **].
   -monitor WBC
   -CIS
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - rx of underling c.diff
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion. Patient apparently
   transiently hypotensive but has remained with stable BP while in ICU.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF is hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**]. Being
   treated with 2 week course of PO vancomycin per d/c summary to end
   [**2180-4-18**].
   -change to IV Flagyl for now given nausea/vomiting
   - touch base with surgery, ?why on PO vanco
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis in setting of hepatic
   failure--lactates continue to rise despite evidence of volume
   repletion. Ischemic bowel remains on differential h/o not c/w with exam
   and CT
   - patient may need to be intubated for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - holding bicarb repletion for now given pt getting too much sodium
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   - will try to give bicarb bolus if needed and sodium stays stable
   .
   # ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for Cr. Cr
   now stable in 1.7 range.
   -follow daily Cr
   -monitor [**Month/Day (2) 949**] to keep above 30cc/hr
   -bolus IVF prn
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.
   - start D10 gtt with q2 hr FS
   .
   # GIST: tumor burden larger than 2 weeks ago on CT scan. Will discuss
   with surgery, continue to discuss with hepatology and oncology however
   current medical issues with lactic acidosis and hepatic failure will
   likely preclude current treatment. Onc feels that Gleevec may not be
   the cause for her current medical issues and would not want to
   eliminate this medication as a treatment option.
   - f/up onc recs --?use of Sutent
   - f/up liver recs--how certain are they that this is Gleevec toxicity,
   risk of retrial?
   - f/up surgery recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She has been admitted multiple times and has undergone surgeries. The patient's current complaints include thirst, confusion, and no pain. The 24-hour events include the agreement of hepatology that the patient's symptoms are due to Gleevec hepatotoxicity, discontinuation of Gleevec, low suspicion for tumor lysis syndrome, recommendation to start allopurinol, and monitoring of lactates.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Liver Failure: The differential diagnosis for liver failure includes Gleevec toxicity, tumor burden, shock liver, alcohol use, other medication toxicity, and non-viral hepatitis. The patient's alpha-1-antitrypsin level was positive in [**2-29**]. It is recommended to continue trending LFTs, hold Gleevec, follow-up with liver recommendations, hepatically dose medications, and continue lactulose for encephalopathy.

2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's nausea/vomiting has been increasing and she is unable to take oral medications. It is recommended to perform a KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) X-ray and change medications to IV for now. Lactulose should also be given.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated at around 18, persistently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who presents with nausea/vomiting, lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and liver failure. She has been experiencing tachycardia with a heart rate up to 130s despite volume repletion. Her blood pressure is stable, and she is being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient also has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count. She is being covered broadly while waiting for culture results, likely due to her history of multiple infections including C. diff. The patient is also experiencing anion gap acidosis with rising lactate levels despite evidence of volume repletion. Ischemic bowel remains on the differential but there is no evidence of it on examination and CT scan. Other potential causes for the liver failure include Gleevec toxicity, tumor burden, shock liver, alcohol use, other medications, and non-viral hepatitis. The patient's alpha-1-antitrypsin was positive in the past. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.7 range and she may require renal dosing of medications. The patient's tumor burden is larger than two weeks ago on the CT scan. Oncology feels that Gleevec may not be the cause of her current medical issues and would not want to eliminate this medication as a treatment option."

   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis with
   encephalopathy and liver failure.
   # Liver Failure: Differential remains broad including Gleevec toxicity
   per hepatology. Other potential etiologies include tumor burden, shock
   liver, alcohol but patient has no h/o etoh, other medication vs. non
   viral hepatitis ( in [**2-29**] negative Hep C and Hep B surface ab postive
   for immunity). Also, pt is  alpha-1-antitrypsin was positive in [**2-29**].
   -continue to trend LFTs

   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
   -cont lactulose for encephalopathy
   .
   # Nausea/Vomiting: Intubated with OG tube
   # Leukocytosis: Remains elevated at ~18, has been persistently elevated
   over last admission. Patient with C.diff on treatment however no
   evidence of other infectious etiology. Continue to cover broadly while
   cultures are pending. Likely inflammatory response to turmor burden vs.
   liver failure. Also with h/o multiple infections in past including
   C.diff, [**Female First Name (un) **].
   -monitor WBC- stable
   -CIS, Blood cx NGTD, Ucx negative,
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - rx with flagyl for underling c.diff- stool negative x 1
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion. Patient apparently
   transiently hypotensive but has remained with stable BP while in ICU. ?
   if secondary to underlying infection.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF if hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**]. Completed
   2 week course of PO vancomycin. Currently on flagyl.
   -Continue IV Flagyl
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis in setting of hepatic
   failure--lactates continue to rise despite evidence of volume
   repletion. Ischemic bowel remains on differential h/o not c/w with exam
   and CT
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - holding bicarb repletion for now given pt getting too much sodium
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   - will try to give bicarb bolus if needed and sodium stays stable
   .
   # ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for Cr.
   Initially, with Cr of 2.2 improved with volume resuscitation. Improved
   to 1.7. Now rising to 2.4 from 1.7 yesterday. Elevated bladder pressure
   concerning for obstructive renal failure. Abdominal ultrasound with no
   evidence of ascites. No remark of hydronephrosis.
   -follow daily Cr
   -monitor UOP to keep above 30cc/hr

   .
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.
   - start D10 gtt with q2 hr FS
   .
   # GIST: tumor burden larger than 2 weeks ago on CT scan. Will discuss
   with surgery, continue to discuss with hepatology and oncology however
   current medical issues with lactic acidosis and hepatic failure will
   likely preclude current treatment. Onc feels that Gleevec may not be
   the cause for her current medical issues and would not want to

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating a significant respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), positive C. diff toxin in stool, and signs of multi-organ dysfunction (liver failure, acute kidney injury). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but ongoing monitoring and management of infection are crucial.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of liver failure with elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. Lactulose therapy should be continued to manage encephalopathy.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output. Daily monitoring of renal function is necessary, and measures to optimize renal perfusion should be implemented.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has recurrent hypoglycemia, which needs to be managed with appropriate glucose supplementation.

6. Tumor burden: The patient's gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) appears to be progressing, as indicated by the increasing size on CT scan. Further discussions with the oncology team regarding treatment options are needed.

7. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis: The patient requires ongoing DVT"

   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis with
   encephalopathy and liver failure.
   # Liver Failure: Differential remains broad including Gleevec toxicity
   per hepatology. Other potential etiologies include tumor burden, shock
   liver, alcohol but patient has no h/o etoh, other medication vs. non
   viral hepatitis ( in [**2-29**] negative Hep C and Hep B surface ab postive
   for immunity). Also, pt is  alpha-1-antitrypsin was positive in [**2-29**].
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -holding gleevac
   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
   -cont lactulose for encephalopathy

   # Nausea/Vomiting: Intubated with OG tube
   # Leukocytosis: Remains elevated at ~18, has been persistently elevated
   over last admission. Patient with C.diff on treatment however no
   evidence of other infectious etiology. Continue to cover broadly while
   cultures are pending. Likely inflammatory response/ cytokine storm to
   turmor burden vs. liver failure. Also with h/o multiple infections in
   past including C.diff, [**Female First Name (un) **].
   -monitor WBC- stable
   -CIS, Blood cx NGTD, Ucx negative,
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - rx with flagyl for underling c.diff- stool negative x 1
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion. Patient apparently
   transiently hypotensive but has remained with stable BP while in ICU. ?
   if secondary to underlying infection.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF if hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**]. Completed
   2 week course of PO vancomycin. Currently on flagyl.
   -Continue IV Flagyl
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis in setting of hepatic
   failure--lactates continue to rise despite evidence of volume
   repletion. Ischemic bowel remains on differential h/o not c/w with exam
   and CT
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - holding bicarb repletion for now given pt getting too much sodium
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   - will try to give bicarb bolus if needed and sodium stays stable
   .
   # ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for Cr.
   Initially, with Cr of 2.2 improved with volume resuscitation. Improved
   to 1.7. Now rising to 2.4 from 1.7 yesterday. Elevated bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though not high
   enough
expect to be greater than 28.. Abdominal ultrasound with no
   evidence of ascites. No remark of hydronephrosis on report
   - ck urine lytes and renal ultrasound
   - empiric fluid bolus in setting of prerenal renal failure
    - discuss with surgery re ? abdominal compartment syndrome
   - follow daily Cr
   - monitor UOP to keep above 30cc/hr
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.
   - start D10 gtt with q2 hr FS
   .
   # GIST: tumor burden larger than 2 weeks ago on CT scan. Will discuss
   with surgery, continue to discuss with hepatology and oncology however
   current medical issues with lactic acidosis and hepatic failure will
   likely preclude current treatment. Onc feels that Gleevec may not be
   the cause for her current medical issues and would not want to
   eliminate this medication as a treatment option.
   - f/up onc recs --?use of Sutent
   - f/up liver recs--how certain are they that this is Gleevec toxicity,
   risk of retrial?
   - f/up surgery recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Liver failure: The patient has lactic acidosis with encephalopathy and elevated liver enzymes. The differential diagnosis includes Gleevec toxicity, tumor burden, shock liver, alcohol consumption, and non-viral hepatitis. The plan is to continue monitoring liver function tests, hold Gleevec, follow up with liver recommendations, dose medications hepatically, and administer lactulose for encephalopathy.

2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is intubated with an orogastric tube. There is leukocytosis that persists, likely due to an inflammatory response or cytokine storm from tumor burden or liver failure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued while awaiting culture results. The plan is to monitor the white blood cell count, perform cultures, and continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline sinus tachycardia, and her heart rate remains elevated up to 130s despite fluid repletion. The cause is unclear, but it may be secondary to an underlying infection. The plan is to monitor the patient on telemetry, consider a bolus of intravenous fluids if hypot"

   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated. Ischemic bowel remains on
   differential h/o not c/w with exam and CT.
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - Giving bicarb and trending sodium
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   -  will try to give bicarb bolus if needed and sodium stays stable
   - d/c lactulose as can worsen acidosis
   - discuss with renal need for dialysis
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for
   Cr.  Initially, with Cr of 2.2 improved with volume resuscitation.
   Improved to 1.7. Now continues to rise. Elevated bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though pressure not high
   enough
expect to be greater than 28.. Abdominal ultrasound with no
   evidence of ascites. Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis
   evidence of obstruction. Attempted fluid resuscitation. Patient
   received total of 10L in yesterday. UO barely 30cc/hr. FeNa consistent
   with intrinsic renal failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be ischemic vs toxic ATN. Urine
   sediment consistent with this.
   - F/u renal recs and possible utility of dialysis in this potentially
   treatable cancer
   - Would only continue fluid boluses for low BP as patient now appears
   volume overloaded
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   - follow daily Cr

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), who has undergone multiple surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations. She is currently admitted to the ICU for lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. The patient is intubated due to severe acidosis and is being treated with bicarbonate and sodium supplementation. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and her white blood cell count remains elevated.

The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely related to poor perfusion, with a baseline creatinine level of 0.6 that improved initially but has since risen again. There is concern for abdominal compartment syndrome, but the patient does not exhibit signs of ascites or hydronephrosis. Fluid resuscitation has been attempted, but the patient appears to be volume overloaded. The patient's urine output is minimal, and her fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is consistent with intrinsic renal failure, possibly ischemic versus toxic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Urine sediment analysis supports this diagnosis.

Liver function tests indicate liver failure, with a broad differential including Gleevec toxicity, tumor burden, shock liver, alcohol use, and other medication effects. Hepatitis B and C serologies are negative, but the patient has immunity to hepatitis B surface antigen. Alpha-1-antitry"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated. Ischemic bowel remains on
   differential h/o not c/w with exam and CT.
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - Giving bicarb and trending sodium
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   -  will try to give bicarb bolus if needed and sodium stays stable
   - d/c lactulose as can worsen acidosis
   - discuss with renal need for dialysis
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for
   Cr.  Initially, with Cr of 2.2 improved with volume resuscitation.
   Improved to 1.7. Now continues to rise. Elevated bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though pressure not high
   enough
expect to be greater than 28.. Abdominal ultrasound with no
   evidence of ascites. Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis
   evidence of obstruction. Attempted fluid resuscitation. Patient
   received total of 10L in yesterday. UO barely 30cc/hr. FeNa consistent
   with intrinsic renal failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be ischemic vs toxic ATN. Urine
   sediment consistent with this.
   - F/u renal recs and possible utility of dialysis in this potentially
   treatable cancer
   - Would only continue fluid boluses for low BP as patient now appears
   volume overloaded
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   - follow daily Cr
   -renally dose meds
   # Liver Failure: Differential remains broad including Gleevec toxicity
   per hepatology. Other potential etiologies include tumor burden, shock
   liver, alcohol but patient has no h/o etoh, other medication vs. non
   viral hepatitis ( in [**2-29**] negative Hep C and Hep B surface ab postive
   for immunity). Also, pt is  alpha-1-antitrypsin was positive in [**2-29**].
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   -holding gleevac
   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Remains elevated at ~16.4, has been persistently
   elevated over last admission. Patient with C.diff on treatment however
   no evidence of other infectious etiology. Continue to cover broadly
   while cultures are pending. Likely inflammatory response/ cytokine
   storm vs. liver failure. Also with h/o multiple infections in past
   including C.diff, [**Female First Name (un) **]. BCX are NGTD.
   -monitor WBC- stable
   -CIS,
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - rx with flagyl for underling c.diff- stool negative x 1
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   underlying infection vs cytokine storm. Have been holding beta blocker
   but patient was tachycardic while on this med so doubt rebound
   tachycardia.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF if hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**]. Completed
   2 week course of PO vancomycin. Currently on flagyl.
   -Continue IV Flagyl
   .
   # Resp: Continuing hyperventilation to maintain ABG
   .
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.  Patient with FS as low as 40
   yesterday
   - Continue D10 gtt with q2 hr FS
   .
   # GIST: tumor burden larger than 2 weeks ago on CT scan. Current
   medical issues with lactic acidosis and hepatic failure will likely
   preclude current treatment.  Per Onc, continue holding Gleevec and
   would consider sutent when more medically stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe acidosis. She has a diagnosis of lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. Her current condition includes ischemic bowel, leukocytosis, tachycardia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypoglycemia, and a large tumor burden on the GIST. She is also being treated for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The elevated bladder pressure indicates the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome, which is a concern for the patient's abdominal organs and renal function.
2. Ischemic bowel: The patient's ischemic bowel is still on the differential despite not correlating with the physical examination and CT findings. This could lead to bowel necrosis and perforation.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver failure. This can cause hypoglycemia and coagulopathy.
4. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, resulting in decreased urine output. This can progress to acute kidney injury or require dialysis.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C"

   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated. Ischemic bowel remains on
   differential h/o not c/w with exam and CT.
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - Giving bicarb and trending sodium
   - Avoid LR for fluid resucsitation
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   - discuss with renal need for dialysis (CVVH)
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for
   Cr.  Initially, with Cr of 2.2 improved with volume resuscitation.
   Improved to 1.7. Now continues to rise. Elevated bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though pressure not high
   enough
expect to be greater than 28.. Abdominal ultrasound with no
   evidence of ascites. Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis
   evidence of obstruction. Attempted fluid resuscitation. Patient
   received total of 10L in yesterday. UO barely 30cc/hr. FeNa consistent
   with intrinsic renal failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be ischemic vs toxic ATN. Urine
   sediment consistent with this.
   - F/u renal recs and possible utility of dialysis in this potentially
   treatable cancer
   - Would only continue fluid boluses for low BP as patient now appears
   volume overloaded
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   - follow daily Cr
   -renally dose meds
   - may need temporary dialysis line. If so give 3 U FFP prior to line
   placement in setting of elevated INR.
   # Liver Failure: Differential remains broad including Gleevec toxicity
   per hepatology. Other potential etiologies include tumor burden, shock
   liver, alcohol but patient has no h/o etoh, other medication vs. non
   viral hepatitis ( in [**2-29**] negative Hep C and Hep B surface ab postive

    # Leukocytosis: Remains elevated at ~16.4, has been persistently
   elevated over last admission. Patient with C.diff on treatment however
   no evidence of other infectious etiology. Continue to cover broadly
   while cultures are pending. Likely inflammatory response/ cytokine
   storm vs. liver failure. Also with h/o multiple infections in past

   # GIST: tumor burden larger than 2 weeks ago on CT scan. Current
   medical issues with lactic acidosis and hepatic failure will likely
   preclude current treatment.  Per Onc, continue holding Gleevec and
   would consider sutent when more medically stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. She presents with lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. The patient is intubated for acidosis and is being treated with bicarbonate, sodium, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is currently on treatment for it. The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite volume repletion, and her blood pressure is stable. She is also experiencing hypoglycemia and has a tumor burden larger than two weeks ago on CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis and hepatic failure, which can lead to anion gap acidosis. It is important to trend lactates, AG, and pH every four hours and give bicarb as needed.
2. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not producing enough urine, and her creatinine levels are rising. This could be due to poor perfusion. Fluid resuscitation has been attempted, but the patient appears volume overloaded. Monitoring renal function and considering dialysis may be necessary.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: Elevated bladder pressure suggests the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome. An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of ascites or"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male in the ICU with an endotracheal tube in place for mechanical ventilation. He is sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and various other medications. His vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being provided. The patient has a distended abdomen with a colostomy bag and a vertical incision with a wound vac in place. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver and kidney function. The patient's condition has been stable with fluctuations in bladder pressure and urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in vital signs, should be done.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection and the patient's unstable vital signs, sepsis is a potential complication. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial.
3. Organ dysfunction: The abnormal lab results indicate potential organ dysfunction, specifically in the liver and kidneys. Regular monitoring of these organ functions and adjusting the treatment accordingly is essential.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated at 14.4.  Started on CVVH
   yesterday. Monitor lactate with hope to extubate patient once acidosis
   resolves.
   - Intubated  for hyperventilation
   - continue to trend lactates, lytes tid
   - Continue CVVH
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. Elevated bladder
   pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though pressure
   not high enough
expect to be greater than 28. Renal u/s negative for
   hydronephrosis
 no evidence of obstruction. UO still low. FeNa
   consistent with intrinsic renal failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be ischemic vs toxic ATN.
   HD line placed and patient started on CVVH.
    -Continue CVVH
   - F/u renal recs
   - Small fluid boluses for low BP as patient is volume overloaded and
   third spacing
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   -renally dose meds
   # Thrombocytopenia: Low fibrinogen levels and mild elevation in fibrin
   split products raises concern for DIC. Day 5 of hospitalization and
   greater than 50% drop in platelet level puts this patient at moderate
   risk for HIT. Has other causes for low platelets however including ?
   infection and malignancy.
   -          consult Heme/Onc re HIT dx. Discuss need to pull heparinized
   line.
   -           send PF4 antibody
   -          d/c heparin SC
   # Liver Failure: currently stable
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Bump in WBC to 20.4. Cultures sent.  Vanco trough this
   AM 34. Empiric vanco/ zosyn d/c
d yesterday.
    -monitor WBC- add on diff.
   - F/U cultures
   - Hold off on empiric antibiotics unless patient appears to
   decompensate
   - Continue IV flagyl and PO vanco for C. diff
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   underlying infection vs cytokine storm. Have been holding beta blocker
   but patient was tachycardic while on this med so doubt rebound
   tachycardia.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF if hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # Resp: Continuing hyperventilation to correct AG acidosis with plan to
   extubate once acidosis resolves. Started on CVVH which may expedite
   extubation. Oxygenating well.  Consider changing mode to pressure
   support in the hopes of weaning pt from vent once acidosis resolves.
   .
   - Begin weaning from vent with PS
   - Decrease sedation as possible
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**].
   - Added PO vanco
   -Continue IV Flagyl
   .
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.  Started on TPN yesterday but
   patient with persistently low FS. Added D10 gtt back.
   - F/U nutrition recs. Increase dose of dextrose in TPN
   - Q2 finger sticks
   - D10 gtt untiil hypoglycemia improves with TPN
   # GIST: Per team plan, will begin Gleevec today.
   - f/up onc recs
   - f/up liver recs
   - f/up surgery recs

   # h/o asthma: continue nebs prn
   .
   # h/o HTN: currently not hypertensive. holding outpatient meds, can
   restart BB if BP tolerates.
   .
   # Wound Care: As per surgery team, countinue wound vac.
   .
   # FEN: On TPN. Bolus for hypotension, D10 drip for hypoglycemia. Volume
   overloaded but oxygenating well. Continue fluid removal with CVVH as BP
   tolerates. Goal CVP greater than 6. Plan to d/c gtt after starting TPN
   to limit fluid intake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She is currently in the ICU due to multiple surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations. The patient presents with lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. She is intubated for hyperventilation and on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). There are concerns regarding thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, tachycardia, respiratory issues, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, hypoglycemia, and GIST management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, which is contributing to the anion gap acidosis. Close monitoring of lactate levels is necessary, and the patient may require further interventions such as CVVH to correct the acidosis and potentially extubate the patient once resolved.
2. Oliguric acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's oliguria is likely related to poor perfusion. Elevated bladder pressure raises concerns for abdominal compartment syndrome. Renal ultrasound did not show hydronephrosis or evidence of obstruction. Frequent monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes is required, along with small fluid boluses for low blood pressure due to the patient being volume overloaded and third spacing.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Low fibr"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated at 14.4.  Started on CVVH
   yesterday. Monitor lactate with hope to extubate patient once acidosis
   resolves.
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - Giving bicarb and trending sodium
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
    .
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. Elevated bladder
   pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though pressure
   not high enough
expect to be greater than 28. Renal u/s negative for
   hydronephrosis
 no evidence of obstruction. UO still low. FeNa
   consistent with intrinsic renal failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be ischemic vs toxic ATN.
    HD line placed and patient started on CVVH.
    -Continue CVVH
   - F/u renal recs
   - Would only continue fluid boluses for low BP as patient is volume
   overloaded
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   -renally dose meds
   # Liver Failure: currently stable
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Bump in WBC to 20.4, New pulmonary infiltrate vs
   effusion on wet read of CXR. Concern for ventilator associated pna
   athough patient is afebrile. Cultures sent.  Empiric Vanco/zosyn d/c
   yesterday. Vanco trough this AM 34.
   -monitor WBC- add on diff.
   - Send sputum cx
   - F/U final read of CXR
   - Continue IV flagyl and PO vanco for C. diff
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   underlying infection vs cytokine storm. Have been holding beta blocker
   but patient was tachycardic while on this med so doubt rebound
   tachycardia.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF if hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # Resp: Continuing hyperventilation to correct AG acidosis with plan to
   extubate once acidosis resolves. Started on CVVH which may expedite
   extubation. Oxygenating well.  Consider changing mode to pressure
   support in the hopes of weaning pt from vent. Now with new infiltrate
   on CXR.
   .
   - Begin weaning from vent with PS
   - Decrease sedation as possible
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**].
   - Added PO vanco
   -Continue IV Flagyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), who has undergone multiple surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations. She is currently admitted to the ICU with lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe acidosis. She has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is receiving appropriate treatment. Other medical conditions include hypoglycemia, tachycardia, and a recent pulmonary infiltrate, which may be related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Medical Complications:
1. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has an ongoing anion gap acidosis, likely secondary to lactic acidosis and hepatic failure. Her lactate levels are elevated but stable, and she is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage the acidosis.
2. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, likely due to poor perfusion. Bladder pressure is elevated, indicating a concern for abdominal compartment syndrome, although the pressure is not high enough. Renal ultrasound did not reveal any hydronephrosis or evidence of obstruction. The patient's fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is consistent with intrinsic renal failure.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has stable"

   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated. Ischemic bowel remains on
   differential h/o not c/w with exam and CT.
   - Intubated  for acidosis
   - continue to trend lactates, AG and pH q 4  hrs
   - Giving bicarb and trending sodium
   - Avoid LR for fluid resucsitation
   - q 4 hrs lytes/ABG
   - discuss with renal need for dialysis (CVVH)
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. baseline was 0.6 for
   Cr.  Initially, with Cr of 2.2 improved with volume resuscitation.
   Improved to 1.7. Now continues to rise. Elevated bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome, though pressure not high
   enough
expect to be greater than 28.. Abdominal ultrasound with no
   evidence of ascites. Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis
   evidence of obstruction. Attempted fluid resuscitation. Patient
   received total of 10L in yesterday. UO barely 30cc/hr. FeNa consistent
   with intrinsic renal failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be ischemic vs toxic ATN. Urine
   sediment consistent with this.
   - F/u renal recs and possible utility of dialysis in this potentially
   treatable cancer
   - Would only continue fluid boluses for low BP as patient now appears
   volume overloaded
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   - follow daily Cr
   -renally dose meds
   - may need temporary dialysis line. If so give 3 U FFP prior to line
   placement in setting of elevated INR.
   # Liver Failure: Differential remains broad including Gleevec toxicity
   per hepatology. Other potential etiologies include tumor burden, shock
   liver, alcohol but patient has no h/o etoh, other medication vs. non
   viral hepatitis ( in [**2-29**] negative Hep C and Hep B surface ab postive
   for immunity). Also, pt is  alpha-1-antitrypsin was positive in [**2-29**].
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   -holding gleevac
   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Remains elevated at ~16.4, has been persistently
   elevated over last admission. Patient with C.diff on treatment however
   no evidence of other infectious etiology. Continue to cover broadly
   while cultures are pending. Likely inflammatory response/ cytokine
   storm vs. liver failure. Also with h/o multiple infections in past

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), who is currently intubated in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. The patient's current conditions include anion gap acidosis, ischemic bowel, leukocytosis, tachycardia, Clostridium difficile infection, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and a large tumor burden from her GIST.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, which is causing an anion gap acidosis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's lactate levels, acid-base balance, and trends in the anion gap. The underlying cause of the lactic acidosis needs to be identified and treated appropriately.

2. Ischemic bowel: Despite the absence of clinical signs consistent with ischemic bowel, it remains on the differential diagnosis. Monitoring the patient's abdominal exam and considering further imaging or interventions as needed is crucial.

3. Oliguric acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to poor perfusion. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels is necessary. Fluid resuscitation and discussion about the need for dialysis, such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH),"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # GIST: Received dose of Gleevec yesterday. Will continue with Gleevec.
    - f/up onc recs
   - f/up liver recs
   - f/up surgery recs
   - continue allopurinol
   - monitor labs tid
   # Shock: likely [**12-25**] inflammatory response with probable component of
   hypovolemia as albumin is 1.6 and she is most likely intravascularly
   dry from 3^rd spacing fluid.
   -          Transfuse 1UPRBCs
   -          Consider albumin for volume expander
   -          Pressors with neo, monitor for gut ischemia- follow lactate
   levels
   # Acid/base status: This am with metabolic alkalosis [**12-25**] overcorrection
   with bicarb. Continues to have elevated lactate. Monitor lactate with
   hope to extubate patient once acidosis resolves.
   - Intubated  for hyperventilation
   - continue to trend lactates, lytes tid
   - Continue CVVH
   # Oliguric ARF: Patient continues on CVVH with improvement in lytes and
   creatinine.
    -Continue CVVH
   - F/u renal recs
   - Small fluid boluses for low BP as patient is volume overloaded and
   third spacing
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   -renally dose meds
   # Thrombocytopenia: Low fibrinogen levels and mild elevation in fibrin
   split products raises concern for DIC. Day 5 of hospitalization and
   greater than 50% drop in platelet level puts this patient at moderate
   risk for HIT. Has other causes for low platelets however including ?
   infection and malignancy.  Concern for TTP this is less likely as TTP
   normally does not cause prolongation of  PT/PTT. Platelets continue to
   trend down with rising INR and stable but low fibrinogen levels.
   -       monitor coags, fibrinogen,
   -      F/u PF4 antibody
   # Liver Failure: currently stable
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   - f/up liver recs
   -hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Bump in WBC to 20.4. Cultures sent.  Vanco trough this
   AM 34. Empiric vanco/ zosyn d/c
d yesterday.
    -monitor WBC- add on diff.
   - F/U cultures
   - Hold off on empiric antibiotics unless patient appears to
   decompensate
   - Continue IV flagyl and PO vanco for C. diff
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   underlying infection vs cytokine storm. Have been holding beta blocker
   but patient was tachycardic while on this med so doubt rebound
   tachycardia.
   - monitor on tele
   - BP remains stable --consider bolus IVF if hypotensive/tachycardic
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # Resp: Continuing hyperventilation to correct AG acidosis with plan to
   extubate once acidosis resolves. Started on CVVH which may expedite
   extubation. Oxygenating well.  Consider changing mode to pressure
   support in the hopes of weaning pt from vent once acidosis resolves.
   .
   - Begin weaning from vent with PS
   - Decrease sedation as possible
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**].
   - Added PO vanco
   -Continue IV Flagyl
   .
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.  Started on TPN yesterday but
   patient with persistently low FS. Added D10 gtt back.
   - F/U nutrition recs. Increase dose of dextrose in TPN
   - Q2 finger sticks
   - D10 gtt untiil hypoglycemia improves with TPN
   .
   # h/o asthma: continue nebs prn
   .
   # h/o HTN: currently not hypertensive. holding outpatient meds, can
   restart BB if BP tolerates.
   .
   # Wound Care: As per surgery team, countinue wound vac.
   .
   # FEN: On TPN. Bolus for hypotension, D10 drip for hypoglycemia. Volume
   overloaded but oxygenating well. Continue fluid removal with CVVH as BP
   tolerates. Goal CVP greater than 6. Plan to d/c gtt after starting TPN
   to limit fluid intake.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She is currently admitted to the ICU for lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure. The patient received a dose of Gleevec yesterday and will continue with the medication. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GIST: Continue with Gleevec and follow-up with oncology recommendations.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing an inflammatory response with probable hypovolemia. Consider transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and albumin for volume expansion. Monitor for signs of gut ischemia and follow lactate levels.
3. Acid/base status: The patient has metabolic alkalosis overcorrection with bicarb. Continue to monitor lactate levels and hope to extubate the patient once acidosis resolves. Intubated for hyperventilation.
4. Oliguric ARF: Continue CVVH with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine. Follow-up renal recommendations. Trend creatinine and monitor electrolytes with repletion as needed. Renally dose medications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Low fibrinogen levels and mild elevation in fibrin split products raise concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Monitor coagulation profile, fibrinogen levels, and platelet count. Consider HIT.
6. Liver Failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # Anion gap acidosis: [**12-25**] to lactic acidosis and hepatic
   failure
lactate stable but elevated at 14.4.  Started on CVVH
   yesterday. Monitor lactate with hope to extubate patient once acidosis
   resolves.
   - Intubated  for hyperventilation
   - continue to trend lactates, lytes tid
   - Continue CVVH
   # Oliguric ARF: likely related to poor perfusion. Elevated bladder

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor who has been admitted multiple times and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several ongoing medical complications:

1. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis and hepatic failure, with elevated lactate levels. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started to help remove the toxins and improve acidosis. The plan is to extubate the patient once the acidosis resolves.

2. Oliguric ARF (acute renal failure): The patient is likely experiencing poor perfusion-related renal failure. There is concern for abdominal compartment syndrome, but no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction on renal ultrasound. The patient's urine output (UO) is low, and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) indicates intrinsic renal failure. A hemodialysis (HD) line has been placed, and CVVH has been initiated. Small fluid boluses may be given for low blood pressure due to the patient being volume overloaded and third spacing.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a significant drop in platelet count, which raises concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has low fibrinogen levels and mild elevation in fibrin split products. There is a moderate risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT"

   # Shock: likely [**12-25**] inflammatory response with probable component of
   hypovolemia as albumin is 1.6 and she is most likely intravascularly
   dry from 3^rd spacing fluid.  However also concern for sepsis and she
   has numerous potential sources of infection including indwelling lines,
   recent surgery and intubation
   -          Transfuse 1UPRBCs
   -          Consider albumin for volume expander
   -          Pressors with neo, monitor for gut ischemia- follow lactate
   levels
   -          Add additional antibiotic coverage, see below
   -          Ck cultures
   -           Monitor HCTs to rule out hemorrhage
   -          Ck ECG to rule out MI
   # Acid/base status: This am with metabolic alkalosis [**12-25**] overcorrection
   with bicarb. Continues to have elevated lactate. Monitor lactate with
   hope to extubate patient once acidosis resolves.
   - Intubated  for hyperventilation
   - continue to trend lactates, lytes tid
   - Continue CVVH
   # Oliguric ARF: Patient continues on CVVH with improvement in lytes and
   creatinine.
    -Continue CVVH
   - F/u renal recs
   - Small fluid boluses for low BP as patient is volume overloaded and
   third spacing
    - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   -renally dose meds
   # Thrombocytopenia: Low fibrinogen levels and mild elevation in fibrin
   split products raises concern for DIC. Day 5 of hospitalization and
   greater than 50% drop in platelet level puts this patient at moderate
   risk for HIT. Has other causes for low platelets however including ?
   infection and malignancy.  Concern for TTP. However, this is less
   likely as TTP normally does not cause prolongation of  PT/PTT.
   Platelets continue to trend down with rising INR and stable but low
   fibrinogen levels.
   -   monitor coags, fibrinogen, FDP
   -   F/u PF4 antibody
   -  Give cryoprecipitate if starts actively bleeding or Fibrinogen level
   drops below 100
   # Liver Failure: worsening INR and rising alk phos, T. Bilil
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   - f/up liver recs
    - hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Bump in WBC to 20.4. Cultures sent.  Vanco trough this
   AM 15.
    -monitor WBC and fever curve
   - F/U cultures
   - Check vanco level
   - add meropenem and fluconazole
   - Continue IV flagyl and PO vanco for C. diff

   Also worse hypotension now back on neo.  Appears to have substantial
   pulse pressure variation on arterial line tracing.
   We will
   1)       check CXR to exclude PTX
   2)       check EKG to exclude large MI
   3)       consult Heme: would we anticoagulate if we found a PE?

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with multiple organ system failure in the setting of a very large and aggressive GI stromal tumor. She is currently receiving Gleevec treatment for the tumor.

The patient is experiencing several medical complications:

1. Shock: The patient is likely hypovolemic, as indicated by the low central venous pressure (CVP) reading. It is recommended to transfuse blood products to address the hypovolemia.

2. Renal failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to renal failure.

3. Lactic acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, which is likely related to the tumor and hypoperfusion. Thiamine dose should be increased.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). PF4 antibody testing should be done, and if positive, the patient's line should be changed. Platelet transfusion should be considered for bleeding or platelet count less than 20.

5. Hepatic failure: The patient may have hepatic failure, and consultation with hepatology is recommended. Medications should be dosed appropriately.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, and discussion with oncology/hematology is advised. Transfusion of factors should be considered for bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old woman with multiple organ system failure and a large aggressive gastrointestinal stromal tumor. She is currently receiving Gleevec treatment for the tumor. The patient is critically ill and has several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing hypovolemic shock due to low central venous pressure (CVP) and signs of poor perfusion. She will be transfused with blood products to address hypovolemia and the low hematocrit (Hct) level.

2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infection due to her critical condition and prolonged hospital stay. All cultures should be checked, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be added until cultures are negative for at least 72 hours.

3. Renal failure: The patient is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal failure. This treatment helps remove waste products from the blood and manage fluid balance.

4. Lactic acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, which is likely related to the tumor and inadequate perfusion. Thiamine dosage should be increased to help manage this condition.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which puts her at risk for bleeding. It is important to follow platelet function tests, such as the platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody, and consider changing the line if positive. Trans"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # GIST: Received dose of Gleevec yesterday. Will continue with Gleevec.
    - f/up onc recs
   - f/up liver recs
   - f/up surgery recs
   - continue allopurinol
   - monitor labs tid
   # Shock: likely [**12-25**] inflammatory response with probable component of
   hypovolemia as albumin is 1.6 and she is intravascularly dry from 3rd
   spacing fluid.  However also concern for sepsis and she has numerous
   potential sources of infection including indwelling lines, recent
   surgery and intubation. GivenPRBCs, IVFs and albumin last night with
   temporary improvement in BP. Now on max dose of neo with low MAP of
   55-60.  Transiently on levophed but developed cyanotic fingers so
   switched back to neo. Also became more tachycardic (150-160s).
   -          Continue IVFs PRN
   -          Pressors with neo
   -          Continue empiric antibiotic coverage
   -         Monitor HCTs to rule out hemorrhage
   -          consider adding vasopressin as second pressor
   # Acid/base status: Metabolic alkalosis likely secondary from high
   bicarb in prismasate. Also continues to have elevated lactate (now 9)
   and anion gap.
   - Intubated  for hyperventilation
   - continue to trend lactates, lytes tid
   - Continue CVVH
   # Oliguric ARF: Patient continues on CVVH with improvement in lytes and
   creatinine.
   -Continue CVVH
   - F/u renal recs
   - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   - renally dose meds
   # DIC/Thrombocytopenia:  Decreasing fibrinogen levels and elevation in
   fibrin split likely [**12-25**] DIC. Day 5 of hospitalization and greater than
   50% drop in platelet level puts this patient at moderate risk for HIT.
   Has other causes for low platelets however including ? infection and
   malignancy.  Concern for TTP. However, this is less likely as TTP
   normally does not cause prolongation of  PT/PTT. Platelets continue to
   trend down with rising INR. Also with cyanotic fingers on left hand.
   Concern that this is secondary to clotting. Per heme/onc would not
   manipulate clotting cascade in this patient with anticoagulation. Will
   also not replete fibrinogen unless actively bleeding.
   -  monitor coags, fibrinogen, FDP
   - monitor HCT
   -  F/u PF4 antibody
   -  Give cryoprecipitate if starts actively bleeding with goal of
   fibrinogen greater than 100
   - transfuse platelets if less than 30.
   # Liver Failure: worsening INR and rising alk phos, T. Bilil 9.2 today.
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   - f/up liver recs
    - hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Bump in WBC to 22.4. Cultures sent.
    -monitor WBC and fever curve
   - F/U cultures
   - Check vanco level
   - add meropenem and fluconazole
   - Continue IV flagyl and PO vanco for C. diff
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   underlying infection vs cytokine storm. Have been holding beta blocker
   but patient was tachycardic while on this med so doubt rebound
   tachycardia.
   - monitor on tele
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # Resp: Continuing hyperventilation to correct AG acidosis with plan to
   extubate once acidosis resolves. Started on CVVH which may expedite
   extubation. Oxygenating well.  Consider changing mode to pressure
   support in the hopes of weaning pt from vent once acidosis resolves..
   - Begin weaning from vent with PS
   - Decrease sedation as possible
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**].  Repeat
   toxin negative
   - IV flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.  Started on TPN yesterday but
   patient with persistently low FS. Added D10 gtt back.
   - Decrease dextrose in TPN
   - Q2 finger sticks
   # h/o asthma: continue nebs prn
   # h/o HTN: currently not hypertensive. holding outpatient meds, can
   restart BB if BP tolerates.
   # Wound Care: As per surgery team, countinue wound vac.
    # FEN: On TPN. Bolus for hypotension, Continue D 10 gtt for low FS.
   Continue fluid removal with CVVH as BP tolerates. Goal CVP greater than
   6.
   # PPX: Pneumoboots;  she has IVC filter as well, PPI
   # Access: 2 PIVs, R triple lumen, A-line, temporary HD line

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Worsening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a drop in platelets and fibrinogen levels, as well as rising coagulation factors. There is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but the heme/onc team does not recommend anticoagulation due to her current coagulopathy.
2. Hypophosphatemia, with concern for refeeding syndrome. The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) yesterday.
3. Hypoglycemia, likely secondary to liver failure. The patient is receiving dextrose intravenously.
4. Acute hypoxia, possibly due to pulmonary embolism (PE) or mucus plugging. The use of anticoagulation is contraindicated in this case.
5. Cyanotic first and second fingers on the left hand, which may be related to DIC or HIT.
6. Hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) hovering around 60. The patient received a fluid bolus and albumin, and the neo (norepinephrine) dose was increased.

   # Shock: likely [**12-25**] inflammatory response with probable component of
   hypovolemia as albumin is 1.6 and she is most likely intravascularly
   dry from 3rd spacing fluid.  However also concern for sepsis and she
   has numerous potential sources of infection including indwelling lines,
   recent surgery and intubation
   -          Transfuse 1UPRBCs
   -          Consider albumin for volume expander
   -          Pressors with neo, monitor for gut ischemia- follow lactate

   # Thrombocytopenia: Low fibrinogen levels and mild elevation in fibrin
   split products raises concern for DIC. Day 5 of hospitalization and
   greater than 50% drop in platelet level puts this patient at moderate
   risk for HIT. Has other causes for low platelets however including ?
   infection and malignancy.  Concern for TTP. However, this is less
   likely as TTP normally does not cause prolongation of  PT/PTT.
   Platelets continue to trend down with rising INR and stable but low
   fibrinogen levels.
   -   monitor coags, fibrinogen, FDP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary:
- The patient has a history of GIST and has undergone multiple surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations.
- She is currently experiencing lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and liver failure.
- Her current conditions include shock (possibly due to inflammatory response, hypovolemia, sepsis), metabolic alkalosis, thrombocytopenia (with concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)), hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, tachycardia, respiratory distress, Clostridium difficile infection, and liver failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to prolonged hospitalization, surgeries, and underlying medical conditions, making her susceptible to infections.
2. Organ failure: The patient already has signs of liver and renal failure, which can further deteriorate if not managed appropriately.
3. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia and low fibrinogen levels indicate an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential.
4. Hypotension: Despite volume repletion, the patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple
   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure and liver failure.
   # GIST: Received dose of Gleevec yesterday. Will hold on further
   Gleevec per Onc given critical condition.
   - Hold Gleevec
   - f/up onc recs
   - f/up liver recs
   - f/up surgery recs
   - continue allopurinol
   - monitor labs tid
   # Shock: likely [**12-25**] inflammatory response with probable component of
   hypovolemia as albumin is 1.6 and she is intravascularly dry from 3rd
   spacing fluid.  However also concern for sepsis and she has numerous
   potential sources of infection including indwelling lines, recent
   surgery and intubation.  Also concern for cardiogenic shock with
   elevateed PCW pressure and pulsus paradoxicus. Given coagulopathy, she
   may have bled into her pericardium. Given PRBCs, IVFs and albumin last
   night with temporary improvement in BP. Now on max dose of neo with low
   MAP of 55-60.  Transiently on levophed but developed cyanotic fingers
   so switched back to neo. Also became more tachycardic (150-160s).
   -          Continue IVFs PRN
   -          Pressors with neo unless change goals of care to comfort
   measures
   -          Continue empiric antibiotic coverage
   -         Monitor HCTs to rule out hemorrhage
   -          consider adding vasopressin as second pressor
   -          STAT Echo to rule out tamponade
   # Acid/base status: Metabolic and respiratory alkalosis. Also continues
   to have elevated lactate (now 9) and anion gap. Diff of respiratory
   alkalosis includes liver dysfunction, sepsis, primary, primary CHS
   problem, anxiety and pain. Patient not stable to evaluate for PE or CNS
   bleed at this time. Would not anticoagulate [**12-25**] coagulopathy and DIC.
   - Intubated  for hyperventilation
   - continue to trend lactates, lytes tid
   - Continue CVVH
   # Oliguric ARF: Patient continues on CVVH with improvement in lytes and
   creatinine.
   -Continue CVVH
   - F/u renal recs
   - continue to trend cr and monitor lytes with repletion PRN
   - renally dose meds
   # DIC/Thrombocytopenia:  Decreasing fibrinogen levels and elevation in
   fibrin split likely [**12-25**] DIC. Day 5 of hospitalization and greater than
   50% drop in platelet level puts this patient at moderate risk for HIT.
   Has other causes for low platelets however including ? infection and
   malignancy.  Concern for TTP. However, this is less likely as TTP
   normally does not cause prolongation of  PT/PTT. Platelets continue to
   trend down with rising INR. Also with cyanotic fingers on left hand.
   Concern that this is secondary to clotting. Per heme/onc would not
   manipulate clotting cascade in this patient with anticoagulation. Will
   also not replete fibrinogen unless actively bleeding.
   -  monitor coags, fibrinogen, FDP
   - monitor HCT
   -  F/u PF4 antibody
   -  Give cryoprecipitate if starts actively bleeding with goal of
   fibrinogen greater than 100
   - transfuse platelets if less than 30.
   # Liver Failure: worsening INR and rising alk phos, T. Bilil 9.2 today.
   -continue to trend LFTs/INR
   - f/up liver recs
    - hepatically dose meds
    # Leukocytosis: Bump in WBC to 22.4. Cultures sent.
    -monitor WBC and fever curve
   - F/U cultures
   - Check vanco level
   - add meropenem and fluconazole
   - Continue IV flagyl and PO vanco for C. diff
   # Tachycardia. Unclear etiology. Patient with baseline sinus tach. HR
   remains up to 130s despite volume repletion.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   underlying infection vs cytokine storm. Have been holding beta blocker
   but patient was tachycardic while on this med so doubt rebound
   tachycardia.
   - monitor on tele
   - infectious w/up as above.
   # Resp/ARDS: now with bilateral infiltrates on CXR and hypoxemia
   consistent with ARDS. Will decrease TV as have demonstrated a reduction
   in mortality in patient with ARDS.
   - follow sats and ABGs
   # C. diff: diagnosed with positive toxin in stool on [**2180-4-4**].  Repeat
   toxin negative
   - IV flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco
   # Hypoglycemia. [**12-25**] to liver failure.  Persistently low FS. Added D10
   gtt despite receiving dextrose in fluids.
   - Decrease dextrose in TPN
   - Q2 finger sticks
   # h/o asthma: continue nebs prn
   # h/o HTN: currently not hypertensive. holding outpatient meds, can
   restart BB if BP tolerates.
   # Wound Care: As per surgery team, countinue wound vac.
    # FEN: On TPN. Bolus for hypotension, Continue D 10 gtt for low FS.
   Continue fluid removal with CVVH as BP tolerates. Goal CVP greater than
   6.

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure, liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Clostridium difficile infection, hypoglycemia, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes worsening DIC with a drop in platelets and fibrinogen levels, rising coagulation factors, concern for refeeding syndrome, hypoglycemia, and acute hypoxia due to mucus plugging or possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's fingers on the left hand are cyanotic, which could be related to DIC or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's blood pressure is low, and she has received several IV fluids and albumin boluses. The patient is on maximum dose of norepinephrine (neo) with low mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60. She has also been switched back to neo due to transient hypotension while on levophed.

The patient's respiratory support includes continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   44-year-old woman with multiple organ system failure in the setting of
   a very large and aggressive GI stromal tumor.
   GI STROMAL TUMOR
   -          received Gleevec.
   -          Holding Gleevec
   SHOCK
   -          Etiology is uncertain
   -          Check ScVO2 and consider dobutamine
   -          Add vasopressin if systemic pressure falls
   -          Check echo to exclude tamponade
   -          Cortisol adequately excludes absolute adrenal insufficiency
   -          Resend sputum culture
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -          now meets criteria for ARDS
   -          ventilate per ARDSnet
   RENAL FAILURE
   -          discuss resuming CVVH with renal
   -          dose meds renally
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
   - likely related to tumor and hypoperfusion. Somewhat stable
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   - follow PF4 antibody. If (+), change line.
   - appreciate hematology/oncology
s help
   - transfuse for bleeding or plt < 20
   HEPATIC FAILURE
   - appreciate hepatology
s help
   - dose meds appropriately
   DIC / COAGULOPATHY / CYANOSIS
   -          Likely secondary to tissue factor being exposed with tumor
   -          discuss with onc/heme
   -          transfuse factors for bleeding
   -          Follow labs frequently for multiple issues (tumor necrosis,
   coagulopathy, etc.)
   -          Check bedside ultrasound of right radial artery.  If
   reasonable, resite arterial line.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old woman with multiple organ system failure due to a large and aggressive gastrointestinal stromal tumor. She has been receiving Gleevec but it is currently being held. The patient's condition has worsened, with shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, hepatic failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), cyanosis, and poor prognosis discussed with the family. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient now meets criteria for ARDS, indicating severe lung damage. This condition can result in respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.

3. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, which may require dialysis to remove waste products and excess fluid from the body.

4. Lactic acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, which is likely related to tumor necrosis and hypoperfusion. It is important to address the underlying causes and provide appropriate treatment.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary."
