   raised strong objections.  If negative for infection, can start
   cyclophosphamide, begin course of therapy for ILD.
   Myositis panel of Antibodies sent with strong suspicion of
   anti-synthetase syndrome.
   ABG at 7pm showed worsened respiratory alkalosis with lactate 4.5.
   CO2 low, if starts to rise, indicates patient has tired:impending doom.
   On Solumedrol (can't take p.o with mask, just IV).
   On IV bactrim (therapeutic dose for PCP), as well as vanc/cefepime
   (was initially on doxy because levoquin can inhib growth of TB in
   culture, and if treated with levo for something else, can develop
   resistance to TB that's also present.
   Repeat ABG at 9:30 pm showed improvement 02, not much change in pH,
   PCO2 indicating not yet at point of exhaustion and bump in bicarb shows
   that with even slight increase in her pCO2 she compensates vigorously
   metabolically.

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Concern for progressive ILD vs

   consistent with progression of NSIP. Could also consider acute
   interstitial pneumonitis given rapidly progressive course with lack or
   response to steroids.  Given that further treatment for ILD would
   require increased immunosupression there is need to rule out underlying
   infectious etiology as contributing factor. Pt started on bactrim on
   admission for concern of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presentation/imaging not consistent
   with common bacterial CAP, could consider atypical organism such as
   mycoplasma or legionella as well as viral etiology.

   without prophylaxis and elevated LDH. Given progressive decline, would
   change to IV bactrim pending further micro data
   - Continue ceftriaxone, will discontinue doxy and start azithromycin

   - Will increase steroids to solu-medrol 80mg IV Q 8 for concern of
   progressive ILD

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's ABG showed worsening pulmonary function, and rheumatology and pulmonary consulted with a strong suspicion for ILD, acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) over infection. The preferred course is intubation to provide an opportunity for bronchoscopy to determine the extent of disease/infection while still having some respiratory reserve. If negative for infection, the patient can start cyclophosphamide and begin a course of therapy for ILD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of hypoxic respiratory failure needs immediate attention. The concern is for progressive ILD vs infectious etiology. Basilar and pleural predominance could be consistent with progression of NSIP. Acute interstitial pneumonitis should also be considered given the rapidly progressive course with lack of response to steroids. Given that further treatment for ILD would require increased immunosuppression, there is a need to rule out underlying infectious etiology as a contributing factor. The patient has been started on bactrim for concern of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been worsening, and there is concern for an infectious etiology or worsening of ILD. The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and requires 80% FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation. The plan includes monitoring respiratory status, repeating ABGs, continuing antibiotics, and considering intubation with bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes. Other ongoing plans include evaluating dermatomyositis, managing osteoporosis, and providing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and she may progress to more severe respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to immunosuppressive therapy and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the potential need for intubation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
4. Bleeding: The patient is on therapeutic doses of heparin sodium for prophylaxis, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Drug reactions/allergies: With multiple medications being administered, there is a possibility of drug reactions or allergies.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Concern for progressive ILD vs
   infectious etiology.
   Somewhat worsened function given increased 02 requirement from 50% to
   80% FI02, maintaining sats at this level, however leaving little room
   for uptitration if needed. Discussed with patient benefits of early
   intubation with bronchoscopy diagnostically and given rapidly
   progressive course of her ILD, poor reserve, likelihood of intubation
   regardless.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status, check ABGs Q6 and with
   clinical changes.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime, azithromcyin (day 20 and bactrim (day 4).\
   -check CXR
   -repeat induced sputum.
   -Continue to consider intubation/bronchoscopy option.
   - continue solumedrol 80 IV Q8.
   -F/U glucan and galactomannan
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.
   - obtain OSH EUS results
   -check LFTs
   - workup of ILD as above
   - follow up on Rheumatology Recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula and is showing signs of respiratory alkalosis with slightly increased hypercarbia. The patient's lactate levels have improved overnight. Rheumatology and Pulmonary consultations have been requested due to suspicion of ILD, Anti-Synthetase Syndrome, or infection. The patient is currently on therapeutic IV dose of bactrim, vanc/cefepime, and azithromycin for empiric coverage of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). There are no known drug allergies.

   CXR looks slightly worse, especially on Left.
   After discussion with her and her husband, explained that given that
   she is on high dose steroids and broad spectrum
   Antibiotics, we have two options:  continue to observe or intubate and
   perform bronchoscopy.   Advantage of bronchoscopy is that we will be
   able to better rule out infection, allowing us to start
   cyclophosphamide.   The downside is that there is a significant chance
   that her lung disease will not improve and she may not come off the
   ventilator.
   She said that she is wants aggressive care if it has a chance to make
   her better.  We have therefore decided that we will go ahead with
   intubation and bronchoscopy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD), admitted with hypoxemia and shortness of breath.
- She started on Bactrim therapy for suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and is on 80% HF oxygen.
- Overnight, her oxygenation worsened, but she felt slightly better in the morning.
- The assessment is respiratory failure, likely due to an ILD flare-up or infectious pneumonia, possibly PCP. Respiratory precautions have been removed.
- She is currently on high-dose steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The CXR shows worsening on the left side, and the patient has been discussed with her husband regarding the option of intubation and bronchoscopy to rule out infection and potentially start cyclophosphamide.
- The patient prefers aggressive care if it can improve her condition, so intubation and bronchoscopy have been decided upon.
- The patient's condition is critical, and she is expected to be in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function.
2. Infection: The possibility of an infectious pneumonia, such as PCP, needs to be considered and managed appropriately to prevent worsening of the condition.
3. ILD flare-up: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the BAL sample came back positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia, and her PTT is elevated. She is currently on various medications including antibiotics, steroids, and bisphosphonates for osteoporosis. The patient's condition is stable, but she remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to PCP infection.
2. Infection: The patient has a confirmed PCP infection, and other cultures are still pending. There is a possibility of developing secondary infections while in the ICU.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia, which indicates an imbalance in fluid and electrolyte levels. This could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Bleeding Disorder: The patient's PTT is elevated, suggesting a possible bleeding disorder. This could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient has a diagnosis of osteoporosis, and there is a risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated due to an increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, which showed positive results for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's sodium levels were low on consecutive lab draws, indicating possible SIADH. She has also been diagnosed with osteoporosis and elevated PTT levels. Other findings include ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, and hypotonic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening of ILD.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): The patient tested positive for PCP, indicating a specific type of pneumonia. It is crucial to continue treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as Bactrim, and monitor the response to therapy.
3. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion): The patient's low sodium levels suggest SIADH. This condition can lead to hyponatremia and fluid overload, potentially causing complications like pulmonary edema or cerebral"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They are currently sedated and unable to provide their own medical history. The patient has undergone several interventions, including mechanical ventilation, insertion of a PICC line, and administration of various medications. Their vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/73 mmHg to 108/55 mmHg, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals bilateral interstitial markings and ground glass in the lower lobes of the lungs. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), dermatomyositis, and hyponatremia. The plan includes continuing with azithromycin, decreasing PEEP/FiO2 as tolerated, and discussing maintenance steroid dose for dermatomyositis. Repeat CT scan of the abdomen is also planned."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease who is now experiencing respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She is currently in the ICU, sedated, and unable to provide her own medical history. She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics and steroids. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 138/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 60%, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and a respiratory system resistance of 16 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 138. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination is not assessed. Her laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows bilateral interstitial markings and ground glass in the lower lobes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the BAL sample tested positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Other cultures are pending.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and treatment plans:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for increased work of breathing, likely impending respiratory failure. The plan is to continue IV Bactrim until the respiratory status stabilizes. Azithromycin will be continued, and other antibiotics will be discontinued. Follow-up will be done for other culture results. The patient will be on pressure support, and attempts will be made to wean PEEP to 8 today. O2 will be weaned to 60% with stable gas.

2. Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with Gottron's papules, helotropic rash, elevated creatine kinase (CK). An evaluation for malignancy was conducted, including a CT torso showing a question of pancreatic mass, but subsequent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was negative. Records reviewed were also negative for malignancy. Rheumatology recommended a repeat CT scan, but this will be deferred for now given the diagnosis of PCP. If the clinical status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated for increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the BAL sample tested positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Other cultures are negative. The patient is currently on IV bactrim for PCP treatment. She has been attempting to wean off the ventilator but has not been successful due to fatigue and inability to tolerate lower levels of FiO2 and PEEP. She also has hyponatremia, which is suspected to be caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), especially considering the large amount of IV fluids she received. The patient's sodium level is 130 today, and urine osmolality is greater than 800. She has been receiving 3800 mL of fluids in the past 24 hours, with a significant contribution from IV bactrim. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxic respiratory failure, for which she was intubated. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been trying to wean off but has not been successful due to fatigue and inability to tolerate lower levels of FiO2 and PEEP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated for increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the results showed positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP), while other cultures were negative. The patient has been experiencing fatigue after decreasing FiO2 to 50% and is not PEEP-responsive. She has also been diagnosed with hyponatremia, osteoporosis, and elevated PTT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of progressive hypoxic respiratory failure indicates a risk of further respiratory compromise. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to her lack of response to PEEP reduction.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): The positive BAL for PCP suggests an active infection, which requires appropriate treatment with antibiotics. Monitoring for clinical improvement and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly is essential.
3. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion): The patient's low sodium levels and high urine osmolality indicate SIADH. Fluid restriction and careful management of fluid balance are necessary to prevent worsening of hyponatremia.
4. Dermatomyositis Flare: Although the"

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, likely impending respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL
   performed after intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back
   positive for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   - discontinued respiratory precautions [**1-20**] negative viral screen and
   culture; all antibiotics stopped and finished course of azithromycin
   yesterday
   - On IV bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] question if PO bactrim would provide same
   efficacy as there is concern over amount of fluid he is receiving for
   SIADH
   -f/u final results of all cultures
   -On pressure support, [**4-27**]. FiO2 of 60% and stable gas. Patient did not
   tolerate decreasing FiO2 to 50% last night, so unable to wean PEEP to
   8.  Will attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Continue prednisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of ILD. Will confirm with
   rheum dose and tapering of dose.
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
   - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD as well.
   - Rheumatology recommended repeat CT scan.  Will defer for now given
   tenous respiratory status.
   .
   #Hypernatremia
 sodium 130 today, was 129 last night. Repeat Urine OSM
   >800. Likely SIADH, but received 3800mL  in fluids in past 24 hours-
   large contribution is IV bactrim. Salt tabs readded last night and
   still getting free water flushes Q4.
   -D/C free water flushes Q4
   -continue to monitor sodium on chem 7.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - continue bisphosphonate, calcium, vitD.
   - calcium low on labs, repleted.
   .
   #Elevated PTT:  PTT has been trending down. Was normal on admission
   (unlikely component of Anti-phosopholipid antibodies)
   -no signs of bleeding
   -hold SQ heparin for now, re-check coags this afternoon with lytes.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated for increased work of breathing, likely impending respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed after intubation, and BAL samples came back positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), while other cultures were negative.

The patient is currently on intravenous (IV) Bactrim for PCP treatment. There is a question regarding the efficacy of oral Bactrim due to concerns about the amount of fluid she is receiving for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). It is also mentioned that the patient did not tolerate decreasing FiO2 to 50% last night, so it was unable to wean PEEP to 8. She is currently on pressure support with FiO2 of 60% and stable gas exchange.

The patient has several other medical issues, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, and osteoporosis. Her respiratory failure is likely due to ILD and possibly PCP infection. The impaired skin integrity is mentioned without further details. Hyponatremia is present, and the patient received a large amount of fluids in the past 24 hours, including IV Bactrim, which contributes to fluid overload"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's recent progress notes indicate that she is intubated due to increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed after intubation, and the BAL sample came back positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

The patient's current condition shows that she is receiving IV bactrim for PCP treatment. Other cultures are pending, and all antibiotics have been stopped except for azithromycin, which was finished yesterday. There are concerns about the efficacy of oral bactrim due to the amount of fluid she is receiving for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on pressure support and her FiO2 is currently at 60%. She did not tolerate a decrease in FiO2 to 50% last night, so weaning of PEEP to 8 is not possible at this time. The plan is to attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of dermatomyositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and now respiratory failure caused by Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is unable to provide her own medical history due to sedation and intubation. The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and Bactrim, for suspected infections. She is being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/66 to 140/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has received fluids and blood products, and her urine output has been monitored. Her laboratory results show hyponatremia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining"

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL performed after
   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -PEEP reduced from 10 to 5 in the past 24 hours. Now on [**4-22**]. Still at
   FiO2 of 60%. Stable gases. Consider decrease fio2 to 50% based on
   afternoon abg
   - On IV bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not switch to PO because Sodium improving.
   Could consider switching to PO if sodium drops as PO bactrim would
   provide same efficacy.
    -f/u final results of all cultures
   -Continue prednisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of ILD. Needs steroids for
   total of 21 days, today is day 8. Will decreased to 40 daily
   -If by tomorrow, no improvement in respiratory status/CXR infiltrates,
   might consider CT to evaluate for a larger role of ILD in her hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well, especially because there has been no dramatic improvement.
    - Rheumatology recommended repeat CT scan.  Will defer for now given
   respiratory status.
   .
    #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, was 130 yesterday. Repeat Urine OSM
   >800. Likely SIADH is the cause. Yesterday free water flushes
   discontinued. On salt tab daily. IV bactrim not switched to PO because
   sodium was stable yesterday.
    -No need from the standpoint of hyponatremia to d/c IV bactrim.
   -continue to monitor sodium on chem 7.

   #?UGIB- Patient with dark residuals that were guiac positive yesterday.
   Now resolved. Hct 26.2 this AM (baseline is 28-30).
   -after Hct check
   -H2 blocker switched to PPI
   -tube feeds currently held for high residuals
   # Osteoporosis:
    - continue bisphosphonate, calcium, vitD.
    - calcium low on labs, repleted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%. Her ABG results show pH 7.48, pCO2 35, pO2 75, and HCO3 27. The patient's recent laboratory tests indicate an elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Imaging reveals right PICC in mid-SVC, OG tube in stomach, and ET tube in good position. Microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxic respiratory failure, dermatomyositis, ILD, constipation, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, and osteoporosis. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of bloodstream infection.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged bedridden status and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
4. Delirium: The patient's ineffective coping and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of"

   provide same efficacy.
    -f/u final results of all cultures
   -Continue prednisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of ILD. Needs steroids for
   total of 21 days, today is day 8.
   -If by tomorrow, no improvement in respiratory status/CXR infiltrates,
   might consider CT to evaluate for a larger role of ILD in her hypoxic
   respiratory failure

   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD as well,
   especially because there has been no dramatic improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated for increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the results showed positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) infection. She is currently on IV Bactrim for PCP treatment. Her PEEP has been reduced from 10 to 5 in the past 24 hours, and she is still on a FiO2 of 60%. Her ABG results are stable. The plan is to attempt spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today with high flow nebs.

Other assessments and plans include:
- Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and being treated for respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy and BAL samples sent for analysis came back positive for PCP.
- Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with characteristic skin findings and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. A workup for malignancy was performed, but no evidence of cancer was found.
- Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, and SIADH is likely the cause. Free water flushes have been discontinued, and she is on a salt tab daily.
- UGIB: The patient had dark residuals that were guaiac positive yesterday but"

   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL performed after
   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -PEEP reduced from 10 to 5 in the past 24 hours. Now on [**4-22**]. Still at
   FiO2 of 60%. Stable gases. Consider decrease fio2 to 50% based on
   afternoon abg
   - On IV bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not switch to PO because Sodium improving.
   Could consider switching to PO if sodium drops as PO bactrim would
   provide same efficacy.
    -f/u final results of all cultures
   -Taper prednisone to 40mg Daily for treatment of ILD. Needs steroids
   for total of 21 days, today is day 8. Appreciate rheumatology recs re:
   taper
   -If by tomorrow, no improvement in respiratory status/CXR infiltrates,
   consider CT to evaluate for a larger role of ILD in her hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well, especially because there has been no dramatic improvement.
    - Rheumatology recommended repeat CT scan.  Will defer for now given
   respiratory status.
   .
    #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, was 130 yesterday. Repeat Urine OSM
   >800. Likely SIADH is the cause. Yesterday free water flushes
   discontinued. On salt tab daily. IV bactrim not switched to PO because
   sodium was stable yesterday.
    -No need from the standpoint of hyponatremia to d/c IV bactrim.
   -continue to monitor sodium on chem 7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated for increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the results showed positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) infection. Other cultures are pending. The patient's PEEP was reduced from 10 to 5 in the past 24 hours and is currently on a FiO2 of 60%. Her ABG values are stable. She is being treated with IV Bactrim for PCP and will be switched to oral Bactrim if sodium levels improve. 

The patient also has other comorbidities including constipation, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, osteoporosis, and elevated PTT. The hyponatremia is likely caused by SIADH, and the patient's sodium levels are being monitored. The gastrointestinal bleeding has resolved, but her Hct is slightly low. Her osteoporosis is being managed with bisphosphonate, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation. The elevated PTT is decreasing and is being closely monitored.

The patient's current ICU care includes IV fluids held due to SIADH, tube feeds held for high residuals, prophylactic PPI, subcutaneous heparin"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of dermatomyositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 mmHg to 142/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 60% FiO2. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, steroids, and other ICU medications. She is also being given tube feeds, but with high residuals, and will be tried on Reglan. Her electrolytes and laboratory values are within normal range. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should closely monitor for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat it.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. The patient is on subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which is appropriate.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a total input of 3,051 mL and a total output of 3,115 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -64 mL. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a low serum sodium level of 102 mg/dL. It is essential to closely monitor her sodium levels and correct it if necessary to prevent complications related to electrolyte imbalance.
5. Pancreatic head mass: The patient also has a pancreatic head mass, which requires further evaluation and management. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen is planned during her admission to assess the mass.
6. Dermatomyositis: The patient's underlying condition, dermatomyositis, should be managed appropriately with steroids and other immunosuppressive medications. The steroid dose will be decreased to 40 mg daily after five days.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual complications and management may vary depending on the patient's clinical condition and the healthcare team's assessment."

 INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (ILD INCLUDING IPF, UIP, NSIP, DIP, LIP,
   ETC)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL performed after
   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -on [**4-22**] yesterday, tolerated ok decreased fiO2 from .6 to .5 and pO2
   went from 70s to 50s so went back to .6. Increased overnight to [**4-27**]
   and FiO2 up from .6 to .7. will continue to wean PEEP and FiO2 as
   tolerated
   - On IV bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not switch to PO because Sodium improving.
   Could consider switching to PO if sodium drops as PO bactrim would
   provide same efficacy.
    -f/u final results of all cultures
   -Taper prednisone to 40mg daily for treatment of ILD. Needs steroids
   for total of 21 days, today is day 9 of steroids and day 2 of pred 40
   daily (normal severe pcp steroid course is 5d 40bid, 5d 40daily and
   11days of 20daily).
   -CT chest done, awaiting final read
   -cultures sent
   -holding antibiotics for now, will consider starting for VAP
   -discuss with rheum and ID, may consider starting further treatment for
   possible worsening ILD
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well, especially because there has been no dramatic improvement.
    - will check repeat CT scan, greatly appreciate rheum recs.
   .
    #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today. Likely SIADH is the cause. Yesterday
   free water flushes discontinued. On salt tab daily. IV bactrim not
   switched to PO because sodium was stable yesterday.
    -No need from the standpoint of hyponatremia to d/c IV bactrim.
   -continue to monitor sodium on chem 7.
   -dark urine, increased HR this morning - fluid bolus given this

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed, and the results showed positive PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). She is currently receiving IV Bactrim for PCP treatment. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and spontaneous Vt of 692 mL. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 111/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is receiving IV fluids, tube feeds, and medications for various conditions such as hyponatremia, constipation, osteoporosis, and elevated PTT. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the respiratory support is not optimized or if new complications arise.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures like elevating head of bed (HOB) and"

   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -on [**4-22**] yesterday, tolerated ok decreased fiO2 from .6 to .5 and pO2
   went from 70s to 50s so went back to .6. Increased overnight to [**4-27**]
   and FiO2 up from .6 to .7. will continue to wean PEEP and FiO2 as
   tolerated
   - On IV bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not switch to PO because Sodium improving.
   Could consider switching to PO if sodium drops as PO bactrim would
   provide same efficacy.
    -f/u final results of all cultures
   -Taper prednisone to 40mg daily for treatment of ILD. Needs steroids
   for total of 21 days, today is day 9 of steroids and day 2 of pred 40
   daily (normal severe pcp steroid course is 5d 40bid, 5d 40daily and
   11days of 20daily).
   -consider CT to evaluate for a larger role of ILD in her hypoxic
   respiratory failure

   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well, especially because there has been no dramatic improvement.
    - will check repeat CT scan, greatly appreciate rheum recs.

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated for increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed, and the results showed positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). She is currently receiving IV bactrim for PCP treatment. Her sodium levels are stable, so there is no need to switch to PO bactrim. The patient's ILD needs further evaluation with a repeat CT scan. She is also being treated for hyponatremia, UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), osteoporosis, and elevated PTT. The patient's current condition is as follows:

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
- Heart rate: 111 bpm
- Blood pressure: 111/92 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 91%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

Physical examination:
- General: calm
- Cardiovascular: regular rhythm, soft systolic murmur
- Respiratory: course breath sounds
- Abdominal: soft and non-tender
- Extremities: 2+ deep pain bilaterally

Lab results:
- White blood cell count: 13.5 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 27.2%
- Platelet count: 211 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
- TCO2: 27
- Glucose: 115 mg/dL
- Other lab values: refer to the attached lab results

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function needs close monitoring, and adjustments to PEEP and FiO2 should be made based on her tolerance.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): The patient is being treated with IV bactrim. It is important to monitor her response to the treatment and check for any improvement in her respiratory status.
3. Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Further evaluation of the patient's ILD is needed through a repeat CT scan. The patient's ILD may be worsening despite treatment.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are stable, but it is important to continue monitoring her sodium levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's dark residuals that were guaiac positive indicate possible UGIB. Close monitoring of her hct and ongoing assessment for signs of bleeding are necessary.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis should be managed with bisphosphonate, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation.
7. Elevated PTT: The patient's PTT has been trending"

   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated for increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed, and the results showed positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). She is currently on IV Bactrim for PCP treatment. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hyponatremia (low sodium), gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), osteoporosis, and elevated PTT. She is receiving various treatments, including IV fluids, tube feeds, prophylactic medications (PPI, SC heparin/pneumoboots, Nystatin rinse), and anticoagulant therapy. The patient's vital signs and lab results are being closely monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is no improvement in her lung function and oxygenation.

2. Hyponatremia (Low Sodium): The patient's sodium levels need to be closely monitored as it can lead to severe neurological complications if not corrected properly.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The presence of dark residuals that are guaiac positive indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. If left untreated, it can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.

4. Osteopor"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient required intubation for increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the BAL samples tested positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Other cultures were negative.

The patient tolerated a decrease in FiO2 from 60% to 50%, but the PaO2 dropped to the 50s, so the FiO2 was increased back to 60%. Overnight, the FiO2 was increased to 70%. PEEP was weaned as tolerated. The patient's respiratory status worsened, which could be due to PCP not responding to Bactrim, decreasing prednisone dosage in the setting of ILD, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A chest CT should help differentiate between these options.

The patient is currently on Bactrim for PCP, and it will be discussed with Infectious Disease whether to continue or switch to a different antibiotic. The patient's steroids were tapered down to 40 mg daily for treatment of ILD. Normal taper prednisone to 40 mg daily for a total of 21 days, as today"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented with respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
- She requires increased levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) to maintain adequate oxygenation.
- The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history, but her condition has been discussed and agreed upon by the attending physician and ICU resident.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Azithromycin and Bactrim), fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.
- Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and she has a SpO2 of 98% on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been intubated and is receiving tube feeds. She appears comfortable without any signs of pain.
- Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance are being closely monitored, with a slight negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours.
- The patient's neurological status is attentive and follows simple commands, but further assessment is not possible due to sedation.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.
- Imaging studies, including a CT scan,"

 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL performed after
   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -still on PSV but FiO2 up to 0.8
   -worsening resp status for past few days and chest CT looks worse.
   Concerned for pna versus worsening ILD
   -continue bactrim
   -f/u rheum recs
   -got salumedrol 1g yesterday, will need to decide whether to give again
   today or start 125 TID
   -cultures sent, this AM will f/u
   -on VAP abx now
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well, especially because there has been no dramatic improvement.
    - repeat CT worse, greatly appreciate rheum recs.
   .
    #Hyponatremia
 sodium 133 today. Likely SIADH is the cause. Yesterday
   free water flushes discontinued. On salt tab daily. IV bactrim not
   switched to PO because sodium was stable yesterday.
   -No need from the standpoint of hyponatremia to d/c IV bactrim.
   -continue to monitor sodium on chem 7.
   -dark urine, increased HR this morning - fluid bolus given this
   morning, will given another bolus now.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - continue bisphosphonate, calcium, vitD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated due to increased work of breathing. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and the BAL samples tested positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Other cultures are negative. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening over the past few days, and her chest CT shows worsening findings. There is concern for pneumonia versus worsening ILD. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient also has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133, likely due to SIADH. Fluid boluses have been given to address dark urine and increased heart rate. She is also being treated for constipation, impaired skin integrity, and elevated PTT.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on PSV with increased FiO2. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed, revealing PCP. She will continue with bactrim and further rheumatology recommendations. Cultures have been sent, and follow-up will be done.
2. Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with Gottron's papules, helotropic rash, and elevated CK."

   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL performed after
   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -still on PSV but FiO2 up to 0.8
   -worsening resp status for past few days and chest CT looks worse.
   Concerned for pna versus worsening ILD
   -continue bactrim
   -f/u rheum recs
   -got solumedrol 1g yesterday, will start 125 TID today, pending rheum
   recs
   -cultures sent, this AM will f/u
   -on VAP abx now in addition to Bactrim
   -still having large tidal volumes, increased sedation but tidal volumes
   remain elevated.
   -will attempt trial of AC this morning for lower tidal volumes.
   -paralysis could be another option to achieve low tidal volumes, but
   given risk with large concurrent steroid doses, not appropriate now.
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -continue Solumedrol 125 IV Q8
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well.  Not responding appropriately to Bactrim, now worsening.
    - repeat CT worse, greatly appreciate rheum recs.
   .
    #Hyponatremia
 sodium 133 today. Likely SIADH is the cause. Yesterday
   free water flushes discontinued. On salt tab daily. IV bactrim not
   switched to PO because sodium was stable yesterday.
   -No need from the standpoint of hyponatremia to d/c IV bactrim.
   -continue to monitor sodium on chem 7 daily.
   -dark urine, increased HR this morning - fluid bolus given this
   morning, will given another bolus now.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - continue calcium, vitD.  Discontinue bisphosphanate for now
 not
   able to crush for NGT.
    .
   #Elevated PTT:  PTT has been trending down, 49 today. Was normal on
   admission (unlikely component of Anti-phosopholipid antibodies)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on positive pressure ventilation due to increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, with BAL samples testing positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Cultures are pending. 

The patient has been receiving Bactrim for PCP treatment but is not responding appropriately. There is concern for pneumonia versus worsening of ILD. The chest CT looks worse, indicating a potential worsening of ILD or superimposed infection. Rheumatology recommendations are needed to decide on the management of dermatomyositis.

The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Fluid restriction has been implemented, and salt tablets have been given. The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increased use of accessory muscles and inadequate oxygenation despite increasing FiO2 to 80%. A trial of assist-control ventilation (AC) will be attempted to reduce tidal volumes. Paralysis could be another option to achieve low tidal volumes, but it is not appropriate at this time due to concurrent high-dose steroid administration.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is being monitored. Osteoporosis management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed, which showed positive results for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient has been on Bactrim for PCP treatment but is not responding appropriately. Her respiratory status has been worsening, and a repeat chest CT scan shows worsening ILD. The patient also has hypothermia, constipation, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, ineffective coping, and osteoporosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening ILD: The patient's worsening respiratory status and chest CT findings suggest a possible progression of ILD. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment for ILD is crucial.
2. PCP infection: Despite being on Bactrim, the patient's respiratory status has not improved, indicating potential resistance or inadequate treatment for PCP. Adjustments in the treatment regimen may be necessary.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to SIADH. Fluid restriction and careful monitoring of electrolyte levels are essential.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Proper skin care and pressure ulcer prevention strategies should be implemented.
5. Constipation: The patient's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who is now experiencing respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient has been receiving treatment with intravenous solumedrol for potential dermatomyositis-related inflammation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with increasing PEEP/FiO2 requirements over the past two days.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Difficult weaning: Given the patient's worsening PEEP/FiO2 requirements and respiratory failure, there may be difficulty in weaning her off the ventilator.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest a potential risk for AKI, possibly due to sepsis or dehydration.
4. Bloodstream infection: The multiple blood cultures obtained indicate a concern for a possible bloodstream infection, which needs to be monitored closely.
5. Nosocomial infection: Being in the ICU, the patient is at an increased risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the risk of developing stress ulcers in the ICU setting.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.
   -on AC overnight, initially improved oxygen sats - tried to wean FiO2,
   but unable to get below 70%
   -worsening resp status for past few days and chest CT looks worse.
   Concerned for pna versus worsening ILD
   -continue bactrim
   -f/u rheum recs
   -now on solumendrol 125 mg IV Q8
   -followup pending cultures
   -on VAP abx now in addition to Bactrim
   -still having large tidal volumes, increased sedation but tidal volumes
   remain elevated.
   -paralysis could be another option to achieve low tidal volumes, but
   given risk with large concurrent steroid doses, not appropriate now.

   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -continue Solumedrol 125 IV Q8
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well.  Not responding appropriately to Bactrim, now worsening.
    - repeat CT worse, greatly appreciate rheum recs.

    #Hyponatremia
 sodium 134 today. Likely SIADH is the cause for low
   sodium, but improving. Free water flushes discontinued. On salt tab

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, dark urine, tachycardia, and requires increased oxygen support. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 65%. Her recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and dependence on high levels of oxygen suggest a potential complication of worsening ILD or pneumonia.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): The patient's BAL samples tested positive for PCP, indicating an opportunistic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals.
3. Dermatomyositis: The patient has a recent diagnosis of dermatomyositis, which is an autoimmune condition characterized by muscle weakness and skin rash.
4. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient's underlying ILD may be contributing to her respiratory failure, and her worsening chest CT raises concerns"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's urine has become progressively darker, and she has shown an increased heart rate overnight, unresponsive to fluid bolus. Her oxygen requirements have increased, and she has been switched to air with improved arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The patient's sodium levels are improving, but she still has hyponatremia. She also has elevated PTT, which is trending down. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, with a recent chest CT showing worsening ILD. There is concern for pneumonia versus worsening ILD. The patient is being treated with Bactrim for PCP infection, solumendrol for dermatomyositis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is also receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and fungal infections. The patient's current disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been progressively worsening, and there is concern for pneumonia or worsening ILD. This can lead to further hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with PCP infection and is being treated with Bactrim. There is"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 7947**] has had a mild decrease in FiO2 needs over the past 24 hours
   with ARDS net ventilation. Her CXR also shows mild clearing of ASD in
   right lung. However given the presence of a fever on current therapy
   and high dose steroids, we will perform repeat BAL to guide antibiotic
   change . BAL will be sent for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7910**], fungal stains and O&P in
   addition to regular pathogens. Husband has been updated regarding her
   condition. Appreciate ID and rheumatology staff input.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's urine has become progressively darker, and her oxygen requirements increased overnight. She was switched to air in the evening with improved arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The patient remains tachycardic and unresponsive to fluid bolus.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and BAL samples tested positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated with Bactrim. She is also on solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8, and her tidal volumes remain elevated despite increased sedation.
2. ILD and Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with Gottron's papules, helotropic rash, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and a question of pancreatic mass. However, subsequent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was negative. The patient is being treated with high-dose steroids and will continue the treatment for ILD as above. There is a concern for worsening ILD due to the known PCP infection.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's"

   have the results by mid-morning to early afternoon. Said parasitology

   takes 10 days to come back] So, I attempted to contact someone from
   pathology to take a look. No clinical pathology fellow on over the
   weekend. Paged regular pathology resident twice, who didn't answer.
   Should try again in the AM. Also, could ask renal to spin down urine to
   see if any strongyloides in it (should be blatant).

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about the worsening respiratory status, which may be due to pneumonia, worsening ILD, severe PCP, or PCP not responsive to Bactrim. The patient's sodium levels have improved, and she is on salt tablets and IV Bactrim. The patient also has elevated PTT and is receiving heparin prophylaxis. The patient's condition remains unstable, and further evaluation and treatment are required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating despite being on mechanical ventilation, indicating a potential complication of worsening respiratory failure. This may be due to pneumonia, worsening ILD, severe PCP, or PCP not responsive to Bactrim.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient initially had low sodium levels, which have since improved. However, careful monitoring is required to prevent further complications related to electrolyte imbalance.
3. Elevated PTT: The patient has an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a possible coagulation disorder. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Osteoporosis"

   -BAL done- sent O&P, AFB, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 8111**]. the lab refused to run the PCP
   and AFB today. Said they could do it first thing in the AM & we will
   have the results by mid-morning to early afternoon. Said parasitology
   lab closed until Tuesday. [Still suspicious for strongyloides, which
   takes 10 days to come back] So, I attempted to contact someone from
   pathology to take a look. No clinical pathology fellow on over the
   weekend. Paged regular pathology resident twice, who didn't answer.
   Should try again in the AM. Also, could ask renal to spin down urine to
   see if any strongyloides in it (should be blatant).
   -Vancomycin levels <2. Redosed to 1250mg Q8. Will need to recheck

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 7947**] has had a slow improvement in her PaO2 over the past 24 hours
   and a clear improvement in her CXR over the past 72 hours despite
   fevers. She has been started on antifungal Rx and her BAL continues to
   show a high burden of PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] am doubtful we are dealing with bactrim
   failure (as yet) and would recommend holding the course on current
   antibiotic regimen but decreasing her steroid dosage to preclude

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support and has shown some improvement in oxygenation over the past 24 hours. However, she still requires a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and has not responded well to Bactrim, the initial antibiotic regimen. The BAL sample results indicate a high burden of PCP, suggesting that bactrim may not be effective.

The patient's condition is complicated by various factors including ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, and osteoporosis. Her sodium levels are improving, but she remains on IV Bactrim and salt supplementation. She is also on calcium and vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis and has had an elevated PTT that requires monitoring.

The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, and her chest CT scan shows worsening findings. There is concern for possible pneumonia, worsening ILD, severe PCP, or PCP not sensitive to Bactrim. 

The attending physician recommends continuing antifungal therapy and awaiting BAL culture results. The patient's steroid dosage is being decreased to prevent myopathy, and weaning of FiO2 is being continued while targeting lower plateau pressures. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Despite being treated with Bactrim, the patient continues to experience difficulties with oxygenation, high A-a gradient, and rising lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Differential diagnosis for continued hypoxic respiratory failure includes severe but resolving PCP, PCP resistant to Bactrim, typical pneumonia, worsening ILD, and no evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have difficulties with oxygenation despite being intubated. This could indicate a worsening condition or resistance to current treatment.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) resistant to Bactrim: The patient's continued hypoxia and rising LDH levels suggest that the PCP may not be responding to the current treatment with Bactrim.
3. Worsening ILD: The patient's underlying ILD may be worsening, contributing to the ongoing respiratory failure.
4. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which may require further management and treatment.
5. Hyponatremia: The"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had a decline in oxygenation over past 24 hours with continued
   fevers and mild reduction in steroids. BAL shows persistent PCP and AFB
   stains are pending. Her CXR does not show worsening in right lung but
   left base may appear slightly worse. She needs improved sedation. If we
   are unable to keep FiO2 needs stable despite this, we will repeat chest
   CT with PE protocol to r/o PE as potential etiology for decline. I
   would concur with ID staff regarding switching to alternative
   medications for PCP at this time. We will follow LFT
s / lipase closely
   if pentamidine is selected.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation despite being on appropriate antibiotics. The patient's condition is worsening, as indicated by rising LDH levels, persistent fever, and ongoing hypoxia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings, as well as consideration for additional interventions, may be necessary.

2. PCP resistance to treatment: The patient is already on Bactrim, but given the lack of response, consideration should be given to adding or switching to alternative medications like pentamidine. Monitoring for any signs of drug resistance or side effects is important.

3. Progression of ILD: The patient's underlying ILD may worsen despite treatment, leading to continued respiratory compromise. Regular reassessment of lung function and imaging studies may be required to monitor disease progression.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 132, indicating hyponatremia. This could be due to SIADH or other causes. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and appropriate management to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show a fever and tachycardia. She has been receiving treatment for PCP with Bactrim, but it appears to be resistant. Other cultures are negative. The patient also has rising levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which may suggest treatment failure or worsening of the underlying condition. She has a history of constipation, anemia, hyponatremia, osteoporosis, and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient's condition is complicated by ILD and dermatomyositis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure has worsened despite treatment for PCP. There is a possibility of worsening ILD contributing to the respiratory failure.
2. PCP Treatment Failure: The patient's PCP infection does not seem to be responding to Bactrim treatment, indicating a potential treatment failure.
3. Worsening Dermatomyositis: The patient's dermatomyositis may be exacerbating her respiratory failure and overall condition.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient initially presented with hypon"

   FiO2 increased again to .7 but gas was 7.42/40/58 so increased FiO2 to
   .75 and switched back to PSV at 5/12 c pO2 increase to 70 initial abg
   reassuring however started to get tachypneic and tachy and pulled
   smaller tidal volumes so switched back to ac early this morning
   -salumedrol decreased to 80 tid, consider decrease again tomorrow, may
   need to d/w rheum
   -pm hct stable
   -ID still considering switching to pentamidine
   -rheum recs: nothing new
   -ID concerned about pt's eye care. ordered artificial tears... don't
   know if there are other things to order

   respiratory failure found to have PCP pna [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continuing difficulties c
   oxygenation
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy and BAL performed after
   intubation, BAL samples sent for analysis
 came back positive for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other cultures preliminarily negative.  Continues to be hypoxic c
   high A-a gradient. Also has rising LDH. DDx for continued hypoxic resp
   failure includes severe but resolving PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] PCP resistant to bactrim v
   typical pna v worsening ILD, no e/o volume overload on am cxr
   -continue bactrim, f/u ID recs
 consider adding pentamidine today.
   -check LDH tomorrow
   -f/u rheum recs, ask about salumedrol taper in setting of somewhat
   worsening resp status
   -on VAP abx and micofungin in addition to Bactrim
 vanco, cefepime,
   cipro.
   -unsure of the prognostic significance of rising LDH-- does this
   suggest pcp treatment failure?
   -f/u pending cx
   -spin urine for strongy
   -keep on AC today, increase sedation to reduce dyssynchrony with
   ventilator.
   -consider esophageal balloon placement to better evaluate pressures.

   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -solumedrol to 80 TID, will need to weigh risks (worsening resp
   failure) with benefits of further weaning of steroids today, would d/w
   rheum before weaning further.
    - Continue workup/treatment of ILD as above
 now with known PCP
   infection, but this does not exclude the possibility of ILD worsening
   as well.  Not responding appropriately to Bactrim, now worsening.
    - repeat CT worse, appreciate rheum recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure.
- She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing and respiratory failure.
- Bronchoscopy and BAL samples were performed, and the results showed positive for PCP.
- Other cultures are negative. The patient is still hypoxic with a high A-a gradient and has rising levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
- Differential diagnosis for continued hypoxic respiratory failure includes severe but resolving PCP, PCP resistant to bactrim, typical pneumonia, worsening ILD, and no evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray.
- The plan is to continue bactrim, follow up with Infectious Disease recommendations, and consider adding pentamidine today.
- The patient's rising LDH levels are being monitored, and it is uncertain whether this suggests PCP treatment failure.
- The patient will be kept on assisted control (AC) mode today with increased sedation to reduce dyssynchrony with the ventilator.
- An esophageal balloon placement may be considered to better evaluate pressures.
- The patient has a history of dermatomyositis and ILD, presenting with Gottron's papules, helotropic rash"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further difficulty in oxygenation.

2. PCP Treatment Failure: The rising LDH levels suggest a potential treatment failure for the PCP infection. If the current treatment with Bactrim is not effective, alternative treatments such as pentamidine may need to be considered.

3. Worsening ILD: The patient's ILD may worsen despite treatment, leading to further deterioration in lung function.

4. Constipation: The patient's constipation needs to be managed appropriately to prevent complications such as impaction or perforation.

5. Hyponatremia: Although the patient's sodium levels are improving, there is still a risk of developing complications related to hyponatremia, such as seizures or neurological changes.

6. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis requires ongoing management to prevent fractures.

7. Elevated PTT: The patient's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicates a potential bleeding disorder, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is ongoing despite being on mechanical ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes severe but resolving PCP, PCP resistant to bactrim, typical pneumonia, worsening ILD, and no evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray.
2. Rising LDH: The patient's LDH levels are rising, which may suggest treatment failure for PCP or worsening of other underlying conditions such as ILD.
3. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which needs to be managed with laxatives and enemas.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is improving. It is likely caused by SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion), but further evaluation is needed.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis and requires treatment with calcium, vitamin D, and possibly bisphosphonates.
6. Elevated PTT: The patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is elevated, and she is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Despite treatment with Bactrim, the patient continues to have difficulties with oxygenation and rising levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Other cultures are negative, and bronchoscopy and BAL samples confirmed the presence of PCP. The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she requires continued ventilatory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is the ongoing difficulty in oxygenation, despite being on mechanical ventilation. This could be due to severe but resolving PCP or worsening ILD.
2. PCP Resistant to Bactrim: The patient's PCP infection is not responding to Bactrim, which may indicate resistance or inadequate treatment.
3. Worsening ILD: The patient's ILD is worsening, as evidenced by rising LDH levels and worsening respiratory status.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 132 mEq/L, likely due to SIADH.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which requires management with calcium, vitamin D supplementation, and discontinuation of bisphosphonate due to inability to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and is experiencing difficulties with oxygenation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has not improved despite being on mechanical ventilation and receiving treatment for PCP. There is a concern for worsening respiratory status.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period.
3. ILD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying ILD may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
4. Ineffective Coping: The patient is experiencing ineffective coping, which could be related to her underlying conditions or the stress of being in the ICU.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bedrest and limited mobility.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient had a low sodium level, which has improved but should be closely monitored.
7. Elevated PTT: The patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is elevated, indicating a possible coagulation disorder that needs further investigation and management.
8. Anemia: The patient's hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted to the ICU with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 75% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O. Despite switching from Bactrim to pentamidine, the patient's clinical condition has not improved, and the repeat CT scan showed worsening of the disease. The patient is also experiencing constipation, hyponatremia, anemia, and elevated PTT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or volume.
2. Barotrauma: High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can cause barotrauma, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Close monitoring of chest radiographs and clinical symptoms is necessary.
3. Oxygen toxicity: Prolonged exposure to high levels of FiO2 can lead to oxygen toxicity. It is important to balance oxygen delivery with the risk of toxicity.
4. Sedation-related complications: The patient is heavily sedated with propofol and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. The patient's condition is not improving, and the repeat CT scan showed worsening.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. BAL positive for PCP, although on the second sample, the number of organisms seen was noticeably reduced. The patient remains stable overnight on ventilator settings with increased sedation.

2. ILD and Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules, helotropic rash, elevated CK. Evaluation for malignancy was performed, and subsequent EUS was negative. Solumedrol was started at 80 TID, and consideration for weaning further today. The workup and treatment of ILD will continue as above.

3. Leg Edema: Chest X-ray does not show signs of fluid overload. Bilateral lower extremity edema is negative. CTA performed yesterday, and the final read will be followed up on.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level improved to 135 today. Likely SIADH was the cause for low sodium, but it is improving now. Sodium levels will continue to be trend"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, her condition has not improved, and her CT scan worsened. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 75% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaO2 of 95, and PCO2 of 32. She has a fever and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy. Her labs indicate hyponatremia, anemia, and elevated PTT. She also has constipation and is receiving treatment for it.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and the presence of PCP, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of clinical signs and regular cultures will be important to prevent and detect this complication.
2. Barotrauma: The high pressures generated during mechanical ventilation can lead to barotrauma, causing lung injury and potentially pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Monitoring of respiratory parameters and avoiding excessive pressures is crucial.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The high tidal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's condition has not improved, and her CT scan shows worsening disease. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with stable overnight settings. She is receiving multiple medications, including pentamidine, vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has leg edema, hyponatremia, anemia, elevated PTT, constipation, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has not improved despite treatment, indicating a high risk of continued respiratory distress and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged intubation. This could lead to worsening lung infection and potentially require additional antibiotics or more aggressive interventions.
3. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) resistance: The patient's PCP infection has not responded to standard treatment, raising concerns about potential drug resistance or inadequate dosing. This may necessitate alternative treatment options.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding:"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and is intubated. There is a concern for worsening respiratory status as indicated by the repeat CT scan showing worsening. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings.

2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): The patient has tested positive for PCP, which is a type of lung infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment with pentamidine has been initiated, but the patient's clinical condition is not improving. Continuous monitoring and follow-up are necessary.

3. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient has a history of ILD, which can further compromise lung function. Management of ILD symptoms should be continued, including corticosteroids and other appropriate treatments.

4. Dermatomyositis: The patient also has a recent diagnosis of dermatomyositis, an autoimmune muscle disease. Treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary to control the disease activity. Rheumatology consultation should be continued.

5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has presented with hyponatremia (low sodium levels). It is important to closely monitor and manage electrolyte imbalances to prevent complications.

6. Constipation: The patient has constipation issues, and laxatives have been prescribed. Close observation and management of bowel movements"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). 

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been sedated with fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol. An esophageal balloon was placed today. The final CT scan showed a slight increase in ground glass and basilar changes, with no filling defect. The LENI's results were negative.

The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and micafungin for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is also on pentamidine for PCP.

Other conditions include ILD and dermatomyositis, for which she is receiving SoluMEdrol 80 mg every 8 hours. The patient's hyponatremia has improved, likely due to SIADH. She has anemia and will receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary (full) at a rate of 45 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has arterial and peripheral IV lines in place.

Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD).
- She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
- The patient's clinical condition has not improved, and a repeat CT scan showed worsening.
- She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- She has been switched from Bactrim to pentamidine for PCP treatment.
- The patient's lab results show anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.
- She has a history of constipation and leg edema, which is likely due to low albumin levels.
- Other issues include osteoporosis, elevated PTT, and hyponatremia.
- The patient is being monitored for potential complications of pentamidine toxicity and ongoing cultures.
- She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition of hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics and antifungals, there is a risk of secondary infections due to her immunocompromised state.
3. Pentamidine Toxicity: Monitoring for adverse effects of pentamidine, such as hypotension, rash, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal disturbances, hemat"

She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She has been intubated due to increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. Her clinical condition is not improving, and a repeat CT scan showed worsening. She is currently on pentamidine for PCP, along with other antibiotics and antifungal medications. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are worsening, and there is a discussion about potential steroid dose and cytoxan treatment. She also has hyponatremia, leg edema, anemia, osteoporosis, and elevated PTT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is not improving, and there is a concern about the effectiveness of the current treatment for PCP.
2. Worsening LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are worsening, indicating a possible adverse effect of the medications she is receiving.
3. Potential Steroid Dose Adjustment: There is a discussion regarding the need for adjusting the steroid dose due to concerns about active ILD and the patient's safety.
4. Cytoxan Treatment: The decision regarding the use of cytoxan is pending, as the rheumatologist wants to assess the resolution of the infection before considering this treatment option.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which requires careful monitoring and management.
6. Leg Edema: The patient has leg edema, which may be related to low albumin levels.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely secondary to blood loss during hemorrhage.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, which requires ongoing management with calcium and vitamin D supplements.
9. Elevated PTT: The patient's prothrombin time (PTT) is elevated, indicating a possible coagulation disorder.
10. Potential Tracheostomy: There is a consideration for a tracheostomy in the future, given the prolonged intubation.
11. Eye Care: The patient requires ongoing eye care, including the use of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment and taping of eyes to keep them closed.
12. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which is being managed with laxatives and enemas.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and is currently on pentamidine therapy. The patient's clinical condition is not improving, and her repeat CT scan showed worsening. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has anemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, elevated PTT, and constipation. She has been started on various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has PCP and is on treatment for it. There is a possibility of other infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding is necessary.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored due to the use of nephrotoxic drugs like vancomycin and potential hypotension.
5. Liver injury: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver injury. Monitoring liver function is important.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition characterized by inadequate gas exchange and oxygenation of the body. This is likely due to the combination of PCP and underlying ILD.
2. PCP: The patient has been diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, an opportunistic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment for PCP includes medications such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which the patient has received.
3. Dermatomyositis: The patient has a history of dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness and skin rash. Steroids are typically used to treat dermatomyositis, but the patient's immune system may be compromised due to the PCP infection.
4. Elevated Transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction or injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. ICU Care: The patient is receiving critical care in the ICU, including mechanical ventilation, nutritional support, glycemic"

   Tip of the endotracheal tube has barely moved, just above the upper
   margin of
   the clavicles. I cannot tell whether the chin is in neutral position or
   elevated. If the chin in neutral position, the tube should be advanced
   3 cm.
   If the chin is markedly elevated this position is acceptable.
   Nasogastric tube has a shorter excursion, but still within the confines
   of the
   upper stomach. Moderately severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality
   with
   basal predominance is unchanged. A tiny volume of right pneumothorax is
   stable. A pneumomediastinum has increased since [**8-25**]. No left
   pneumothorax or pleural effusion on either side.
   9/9/9 4p cxr: Pneumomediastinum is increased from [**2183-8-27**]. A likely
   small right apical
   pneumothorax is stable. ET tube is 6 cm from carina. Right PICC line
   tip is
   in upper SVC. NG tube is coiled in stomach, tip pointed towards GE
   junction.
   Diffuse interstitial abnormality is similar. However, a left basilar
   opacity
   is larger, and there is a new right patchy mid lung opacity, could
   reflect
   worsening atelectasis or consolidation
   9/9/9 7p Stable appearance of pneumomediastinum. Small right apical
   pneumothorax
   appears stable. Diffuse interstitial abnormalities with haziness of the
   lungs
   bilaterally appear slightly worse from 5 p.m.. Left retrocardiac and

   consolidation/atelectasis is similar.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, her clinical condition is not improving, and a repeat CT scan showed worsening findings. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased sedation. She has developed pneumomediastinum, likely secondary to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and there is a concern for small pneumothorax. The patient's oxygen saturation has been fluctuating, and she required paralysis to improve oxygenation. The family has made the decision for a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumothorax: The presence of pneumomediastinum and a small pneumothorax increases the risk of developing a tension pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate treatment for PCP, the patient's condition is not improving, indicating a potential for other infections or resistant organisms.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be attributed to pentamidine or other underlying liver pathology.
5. Hyponatremia"

   12p cxr: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-27**], 3:33 a.m.:
   Tip of the endotracheal tube has barely moved, just above the upper
   margin of
   the clavicles. I cannot tell whether the chin is in neutral position or
   elevated. If the chin in neutral position, the tube should be advanced
   3 cm.
   If the chin is markedly elevated this position is acceptable.
   Nasogastric tube has a shorter excursion, but still within the confines
   of the
   upper stomach. Moderately severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality
   with
   basal predominance is unchanged. A tiny volume of right pneumothorax is
   stable. A pneumomediastinum has increased since [**8-25**]. No left
   pneumothorax or pleural effusion on either side.
   9/9/9 4p cxr: Pneumomediastinum is increased from [**2183-8-27**]. A likely
   small right apical
   pneumothorax is stable. ET tube is 6 cm from carina. Right PICC line
   tip is
   in upper SVC. NG tube is coiled in stomach, tip pointed towards GE
   junction.
   Diffuse interstitial abnormality is similar. However, a left basilar
   opacity
   is larger, and there is a new right patchy mid lung opacity, could
   reflect
   worsening atelectasis or consolidation
   9/9/9 7p Stable appearance of pneumomediastinum. Small right apical
   pneumothorax
   appears stable. Diffuse interstitial abnormalities with haziness of the
   lungs
   bilaterally appear slightly worse from 5 p.m.. Left retrocardiac and
   basilar
   consolidation/atelectasis is similar.

   condition is not improving, however, and repeat CT scan yesterday
   looked worse than previous.  Stable overnight on vent settings, with

   sats in high 70s and low 80s on FiO2 of 100%. cxr did not show ptx but
   did show pneumomediastinum. Attempted to suction pt s effect, also
   attempted recruitment manuveurs and manually bagging pt. Eventually
   decided to paralyze pt. This led to improvement in O2 sats in the high

   the setting of pt becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Despite treatment, her condition has not improved, and she continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. The patient's recent deterioration included an episode of acute hypoxia where her oxygen saturation levels dropped to the high 70s and low 80s. A chest X-ray showed pneumomediastinum but no pneumothorax. The patient was paralyzed to improve oxygenation, which led to an improvement in her oxygen saturation levels. She has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has not improved despite treatment for PCP. She continues to have difficulties with oxygenation, indicating a potential for ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient developed pneumomediastinum, which is a collection of air in the mediastinum. This condition can be caused by various factors such as barotrauma from mechanical ventilation or esophageal rupture.
3. Pneumothorax: Although not currently present, the patient's history of pneumothorax increases her risk for recurrent episodes. This can lead to respiratory distress and further deterioration in oxygen"

   12p cxr: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-27**], 3:33 a.m.:
   Tip of the endotracheal tube has barely moved, just above the upper
   margin of
   the clavicles. I cannot tell whether the chin is in neutral position or
   elevated. If the chin in neutral position, the tube should be advanced
   3 cm.
   If the chin is markedly elevated this position is acceptable.
   Nasogastric tube has a shorter excursion, but still within the confines
   of the
   upper stomach. Moderately severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality
   with
   basal predominance is unchanged. A tiny volume of right pneumothorax is
   stable. A pneumomediastinum has increased since [**8-25**]. No left
   pneumothorax or pleural effusion on either side.
   9/9/9 4p cxr: Pneumomediastinum is increased from [**2183-8-27**]. A likely
   small right apical
   pneumothorax is stable. ET tube is 6 cm from carina. Right PICC line
   tip is
   in upper SVC. NG tube is coiled in stomach, tip pointed towards GE
   junction.
   Diffuse interstitial abnormality is similar. However, a left basilar
   opacity
   is larger, and there is a new right patchy mid lung opacity, could
   reflect
   worsening atelectasis or consolidation
   9/9/9 7p Stable appearance of pneumomediastinum. Small right apical
   pneumothorax
   appears stable. Diffuse interstitial abnormalities with haziness of the
   lungs
   bilaterally appear slightly worse from 5 p.m.. Left retrocardiac and
   basilar
   consolidation/atelectasis is similar.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. Her oxygenation has been difficult, with saturation levels in the high 70s to low 80s on FiO2 of 100%. The chest X-ray shows pneumomediastinum but no pneumothorax. She has been paralyzed to improve oxygenation, which has shown improvement. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is worsening despite being on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The presence of air in the mediastinum can lead to further complications such as pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
4. Ineffective Oxygenation: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygenation, which can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ damage.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been paralyzed with paralytics. Her oxygenation has significantly declined over the past day. The plan is to try to come off the paralytic today if there is any improvement in oxygenation. She will continue receiving micafungin.

The patient also has pneumomediastinum, which appears to be improving. Serial chest X-rays will be followed to monitor the condition, and the current PEEP level will be maintained.

For PCP, the patient was switched back to Bactrim. For ILD and dermatomyositis, she is receiving 80 mg q8 hours of SoluMEdrol. Elevated transaminases may be managed with [**1-20**] pentamidine, now switched to Bactrim. Other issues will be addressed by the ICU team.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (arterial line and PICC line) are being managed accordingly. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous UF heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcer, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) along with mouth care for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum, and PCP. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 mmHg to 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelets. Blood cultures were obtained at different times. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver enzymes, are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including micafungin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin, and Bactrim. She is also receiving sedation and paralysis medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing micafungin, trying to wean off the paralytic if there is improvement in oxygenation, and monitoring for pneumomediastinum with serial chest X-rays. The patient's code status"

   The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently diagnosed
   dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory
   failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status worsening, now
   on 100% FiO2.
   24 Hour Events:
   -d/ced following meds while paralyzed: Metoclopramide 10 mg IV Q6H,
   Docusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg NG [**Hospital1 **]  View, Senna 1 TAB NG [**Hospital1 **]:PRN
   constipation, Acetaminophen 325-650 mg NG Q6H:PRN pain  View, Lactulose
   30 mL NG TID, Calcium, Vitamin D
   -CT surgery left note - following CXR, no intervention for now.  Will
   continue to follow serial chest x rays today.
   -ID recs:  continue IV Bactrim and micafungin.  F/U RUQ US.
   -Initial read for RUQ US - gallbladder wall edema with some bile
   sludging, no visible stones.  Could very well be consistent with
   overall edema and hypoalbuminemia, but cannot exclude cholecystitis.
   -Paged by heme path fellow at 2 pm - smear from diff. showed 50%
   dysplastic nucleated red cells: evidence for extreme marrow stress.
   -9 am and 3 pm CXR's showed noticeable pneumomediastinum - discussed
   with radiologist who did not think that there was significant worsening
   in the interval between the two.  No clear sign of pneumothorax.
   -ABG at 2:20 pm - 7.41/54/57 on FiO2 100%, PEEP 14, TV 450, RR 28.
   -Overnight we attempted several recruitment maneuvers and switched the
   mode to pressure control in an effort to optimize PEEP and follow tidal
   volumes.  Unable to wean from 100% FiO2.  Initially the FiO2 increased,
   but this decreased the PCO2.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she is currently on 100% FiO2. 

The patient has been intubated for increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. Several recruitment maneuvers have been attempted overnight to improve oxygenation, and the mode has been changed to pressure control to evaluate changing tidal volumes. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 73, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 91. 

The patient's fever is likely due to PCP or possible catheter-related bloodstream infection. She has been started on micafungin in addition to Bactrim and is no longer on vancomycin, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin. 

Pneumomediastinum was noted on chest x-ray, but it does not appear to be worsening. It is believed to be secondary to PEEP and PCP. 

The patient's ILD and dermatomyositis are being closely monitored, as well as her elevated white blood cell count with 50% dysplastic nucleated red cells.

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she is currently on 100% FiO2. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced episodes of deep sedation while paralyzed, receiving medications such as metoclopramide, docusate sodium, senna, acetaminophen, lactulose, calcium, and vitamin D.
- The patient underwent a CT scan of the chest, which did not reveal any intervention.
- The patient's infection recommendations include continuing with IV Bactrim and micafungin. A follow-up abdominal ultrasound (RUQ US) showed gallbladder wall edema with some bile sludging, possibly consistent with overall edema and hypoalbuminemia, but cannot exclude cholecystitis.
- The patient's blood smear showed 50% dysplastic nucleated red cells, indicating extreme marrow stress.
- The patient's chest x-rays showed noticeable pneumomediastinum but did not worsen significantly between the 9 am and 3 pm images. There was no clear sign of pneumothorax.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) at 2:20 pm showed a pH of 7"

   sludging, no visible stones.  Could very well be consistent with
   overall edema and hypoalbuminemia, but cannot exclude cholecystitis.
   -Paged by heme path fellow at 2 pm - smear from diff. showed 50%
   dysplastic nucleated red cells: evidence for extreme marrow stress.
   -9 am and 3 pm CXR's showed noticeable pneumomediastinum - discussed
   with radiologist who did not think that there was significant worsening
   in the interval between the two.  No clear sign of pneumothorax.
   -ABG at 2:20 pm - 7.41/54/57 on FiO2 100%, PEEP 14, TV 450, RR 28.
   -Overnight we attempted several recruitment maneuvers and switched the
   mode to pressure control in an effort to optimize PEEP and follow tidal
   volumes.  Unable to wean from 100% FiO2.  Initially the FiO2 increased,
   but this decreased the PCO2.
   -Did not diurese yesterday
 fluid even over the course of the day.

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status
   worsening, now on 100% FiO2.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Still on 100% FiO2
   -Several attempts at recruitment maneuvers overnight in an attempt to
   improve oxygenation.  Changed to pressure control to evaluate changing
   tidal volumes.  Most recent ABG 7.26/73/91
   -continue current vent settings for now
   -will stop paralytics and restart PO meds
   -thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and are aware of pt. If there is concern
   for ptx they should be paged and will come place b/l chest tubes stat.
   The are following
 came by last night to check in.
   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly
   -rheum continues to follow
   -will speak with ID re: d/c
ing micafungin since elevated LFT
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued.
   -continue to follow pending cultures
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 13 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue Solumedrol but decrease from 80 TID to 60 TID
   .
   #pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized
 air distribution seems to shift, but
   radiology yesterday did not see worsening.
   -will re-check CXR in 12 hours.
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   -continue to follow rheum recommendations
   .
   # elevated WBC, stable steroid dose: could be [**1-20**] stress, but
   concerning given clinical deterioration.
   -differential added on to yesterday
s CBC      showed 50% atypical
   nucleated red cells.
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  Will specifically ask ID to comment.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
   -will consult hepatology
   -will speak with ID re: d/c
ing micafungin
   -will send hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   .
   # leg edema: cxr does not look fluid overloaded.
   -bilateral LENI's negative and CTA all negative for DVT/PE
   -likely edema is [**1-20**] low albumin
     #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, stable between 131-135.
   -continue to trend sodium, follow lytes.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   -stopped all oral meds at this point while paralyzed.
    .
   #Elevated PTT: continue to trend. seems to stay between 40-70.
   -trend coags
   -hep sc BID
   .
   #anemia:  HCT 22 today, though sample reported hemolyzed.  Guiac
   positive stool, but no other signs of active bleeding.
   -will keep active T&C

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Her respiratory status is worsening, and she is currently on 100% FiO2.

The patient underwent several recruitment maneuvers overnight to improve oxygenation but was unsuccessful. She is still on pressure control ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O.

Her laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count with 17.3 K/uL. Her blood cultures are pending. She also has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating possible hepatotoxicity.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound revealed gallbladder wall edema, which could be due to hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema. However, cholecystitis cannot be completely ruled out. A HIDA scan would be the next step to rule out cholecystitis, but it is not indicated at the moment.

The patient's leg edema is likely due to low albumin levels. Her sodium level is stable between 131-135, indicating hyponatremia. She has a history of osteoporosis and an elevated PTT, which should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

- The patient has been experiencing fever, with a maximum temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F) recorded at 12:00 AM.
- Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate between 84-101 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 99/52 to 90/52 mmHg, tachypnea with respiratory rate between 32-35 breaths per minute, and low oxygen saturation at 89%.
- The patient's weight has increased from 64.9 kg at admission to 85.2 kg currently.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,975 mL and output of 3,845 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 130 mL.
- Respiratory support includes ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 31 cmH2O, and compliance of 20 cmH2O/mL. The patient is on 100% FiO2 with SpO2 at 89%.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L,"
119749.0,204020,2183-08-29 05:58:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently diagnosed
   dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory
   failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status worsening, now
   on 100% FiO2.
   24 Hour Events:
   -d/ced following meds while paralyzed: Metoclopramide 10 mg IV Q6H,
   Docusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg NG [**Hospital1 **]  View, Senna 1 TAB NG [**Hospital1 **]:PRN
   constipation, Acetaminophen 325-650 mg NG Q6H:PRN pain  View, Lactulose
   30 mL NG TID, Calcium, Vitamin D
   -CT surgery left note - following CXR, no intervention for now.  Will
   continue to follow serial chest x rays today.
   -ID recs:  continue IV Bactrim and micafungin.  F/U RUQ US.
   -Initial read for RUQ US - gallbladder wall edema with some bile
   sludging, no visible stones.  Could very well be consistent with
   overall edema and hypoalbuminemia, but cannot exclude cholecystitis.
   -Paged by heme path fellow at 2 pm - smear from diff. showed 50%
   dysplastic nucleated red cells: evidence for extreme marrow stress.
   -9 am and 3 pm CXR's showed noticeable pneumomediastinum - discussed
   with radiologist who did not think that there was significant worsening
   in the interval between the two.  No clear sign of pneumothorax.
   -ABG at 2:20 pm - 7.41/54/57 on FiO2 100%, PEEP 14, TV 450, RR 28.
   -Overnight we attempted several recruitment maneuvers and switched the
   mode to pressure control in an effort to optimize PEEP and follow tidal
   volumes.  Unable to wean from 100% FiO2.  Initially the FiO2 increased,
   but this decreased the PCO2.
   -Did not diurese yesterday
 fluid even over the course of the day.

   #pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]

   Disposition:  ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Her respiratory status has been worsening, and she is currently on 100% FiO2. The patient has undergone several recruitment maneuvers overnight to improve oxygenation and has been switched to pressure control to evaluate tidal volumes. Her most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 73, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 91. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she is heavily dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum on chest X-ray, likely due to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and PCP infection. This can lead to complications such as tension pneumothorax or mediastinitis.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient has RUQ pain and gallbladder wall edema seen on ultrasound, raising concern for cholecystitis. However, the current clinical setting makes it inappropriate to perform a HIDA scan to confirm this diagnosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have PCP pneumonia. Despite some response to recruitment maneuvers, the patient continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. She is on mechanical ventilation with PCV mode and a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 32 breaths per minute, PEEP at 16 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 100%. 

The patient has a distended gallbladder but no sludge or stones. Her blood cultures are negative for bacterial infection. She has received multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Liver enzymes are also elevated. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F) and a current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F). Her blood pressure is on the lower side, with a minimum of 90/52 mmHg. Her heart rate is stable within the normal range. She has a low oxygen saturation level of 89%. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, constipation, ineffective"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2183-8-30**] 04:15 AM
   -goal PaO2>55, goal O2 sat>90%. Used derecruitment and  came down.
   increased minute ventilation to 34. Stable gas.
   -discussed case in M&M, no other real changes in management. Have
   decided to slightly wean down on steroids. Changed to 60mg x 2 doses
   today, 40mg tonight for 3rd dose; switching to 40mg TID
   -For increased LFT's, consulted hepatology-think its ischemic in origin
   and just want to trend LFTs for now. Likely [**1-20**] pentamidine. Other
   possibility is micofungin-- ID said OK to d/c. Might consider changing
   bactrim to clinda/primaquine if still suspect medication effect on
   LFT's.
   Sent hepatitis serologies (?in the setting of steroids could have some
   reactivation of hepatitis B or C?)
   -ID does not feel strongly about a HIDA.
   -Had [**3-22**] twitches even with cisatracurium. Paralytic was d/c'ed (not
   breathing against vent at all). Haven't yet restarted reglan, colace,
   senna, tylenol, lactulose, calcium, or tube feeds
   -Hct 22-->16. No evidence of bleeding anywhere. hemolysis

   Imaging: The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The right PICC line
   tip is at the
   level of superior SVC. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The
   cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The degree of pneumomediastinum
   is
   difficult to appreciate on the current study, which appears to be
   unchanged
   since the prior study, relatively mild.
   The bilateral extensive parenchymal opacities that most likely
   represent a
   known PCP pneumonia are unchanged. Pneumopericardium is grossly
   unchanged
   since the prior study.

   -paralytics restarted this AM b/c some breathing against vent.  Also
   attempting to come down on her propofol, since extremely elevated TG's.
   -thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and are aware of pt. If there is concern
   for ptx they should be paged and will come place b/l chest tubes stat.
   The are following
 came by last night to check in.
   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly
   -rheum continues to follow
   -ID said OK to dc micafungin in light of LFT's (done yesterday); might
   consider switching bactrim to clinda/primaquine if LFT's remain
   elevated
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued yesterday. Will restart in
   light of hypotension and concern for septic shock
   -continue to follow pending cultures, will reculture
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 15 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue Solumedrol but decrease from 60TID to 40TID
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays.
   -will re-check CXR [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #Anemia: Patient with acute drop in HCT from 22 to 16. repeated x 2.
   Also reflected in Hgb. s/p 2 units and Hct increased to 27, Hct 24 this
   AM.
   Guiac positive stool for hospitalization (likely [**1-20**] ulcer). No bloody
   ET secretions. No oozing anywhere. other coags/plts stable. Hemolysis
   labs negative. Note 50% atypical reds from marrow stress. Had been
   hemodynamically stable until not oxygenating well.  Concern for some
   occult bleed we are not seeing, especially in light of abdominal
   distension.
   -will continue to trend q8h; Hct <25, will transfuse
   - No bleeding in NG lavage, will relavage.
   -continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: new this am
   -will reculture and start empiric abx ? of gallbladder as source?
   -lactic acidosis could also be [**1-20**] hypovolemia/bleeding as well
   .
   #Hypotension: required boluses overnight despite little diuresis with
   lasix. Off levophed.
   -maintain MAP>65 with IVF boluses and levophed as needed
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   -continue to follow rheum recommendation
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of
   resolving ischemia, as proposed by hepatology
   -f/u hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   -d/c'ed micafungin b/c can cause increase in LFT's in <5%
   .
   # leg edema: cxr does not look fluid overloaded.
   -bilateral LENI's negative and CTA all negative for DVT/PE. Maintaining
   good O2 sats on AC. Not large concern for new PE right now.
   -likely edema is [**1-20**] low albumin
     #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, stable between 131-135.
   -continue to trend sodium, follow lytes.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   -stopped all oral meds at this point, until sure will not be
   reparalyzed
    .
   #Elevated PTT: continue to trend. seems to stay between 40-70.
   -trend coags
   -hep sc BID
   .
   #Eye care
erythromycin ophthalmic ointment
   .
   #Constipation: stooling appropriately on current regimen s/p soap suds
   enema.
   # FEN
Tube feeds DC-ed while paralyzed.  PO meds discontinued, will
   re-start when sure will not add back paralytics.  Gave lasix yesterday
   but didn't really put out. IVF boluses as needed for hypotension.
   Replete electrolytes PRN.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's clinical status has been worsening, with increased work of breathing and hypoxia requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, anemia, lactic acidosis, pneumomediastinum, constipation, leg edema, hyponatremia, osteoporosis, elevated PTT, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, steroids, and other supportive care medications. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

Imaging studies reveal pneumomediastinum, but no signs of pneumopericardium or significant pleural effusion. 

The patient's social support is being provided by a licensed independent clinical social worker (LICSW). 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)."

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2183-8-30**] 04:15 AM
   -goal PaO2>55, goal O2 sat>90%. Used derecruitment and  came down.
   increased minute ventilation to 34. Stable gas.
   -discussed case in M&M, no other real changes in management. Have
   decided to slightly wean down on steroids. Changed to 60mg x 2 doses
   today, 40mg tonight for 3rd dose; switching to 40mg TID
   -For increased LFT's, consulted hepatology-think its ischemic in origin
   and just want to trend LFTs for now. Likely [**1-20**] pentamidine. Other
   possibility is micofungin-- ID said OK to d/c. Might consider changing
   bactrim to clinda/primaquine if still suspect medication effect on
   LFT's.
   Sent hepatitis serologies (?in the setting of steroids could have some
   reactivation of hepatitis B or C?)
   -ID does not feel strongly about a HIDA.
   -Had [**3-22**] twitches even with cisatracurium. Paralytic was d/c'ed (not

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status
   worsening, now on 100% FiO2.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Still on 100% FiO2 and on pressure control.
   -Several attempts at recruitment maneuvers overnight in an attempt to
   improve oxygenation.  Did have PaO2 of 55. Increased PEEP to 16 to
   increase tidal volumes
   -continue current vent settings for now; recheck ABG's as necessary for
   SpO2<90
   -paralytics stopped yesterday and pt not breathing against vent. Also
   attempting to come down on her propofol, since extremely elevated TG's.
   -thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and are aware of pt. If there is concern
   for ptx they should be paged and will come place b/l chest tubes stat.
   The are following
 came by last night to check in.
   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly
   -rheum continues to follow
   -ID said OK to d/c micafungin in light of LFT's (done yesterday); might
   consider switching bactrim to clinda/primaquine if LFT's remain
   elevated
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued.
   -continue to follow pending cultures
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 15 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue Solumedrol but decrease from 60TID to 40TID
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays.
   -will re-check CXR [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #Anemia: Patient with acute drop in HCT from 22 to 16. repeated x 2.
   Also reflected in Hgb. s/p 2 units and Hct increased to 27. ? lab
   error. No bleeding in NG lavage. Guiac positive stool for
   hospitalization. No bloody ET secretions. No oozing anywhere. other
   coags/plts stable. Hemolysis labs negative. Note 50% atypical reds from
   marrow stress. Had been hemodynamically stable until not oxygenating
   well.
   -will continue to trend; Hct <21, will transfuse
   #Hypotension: required boluses overnight despite little diuresis with
   lasix. Off levophed.
   -maintain MAP>65 with IVF boluses and levophed as needed
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   -continue to follow rheum recommendations
   .
   # elevated WBC, stable steroid dose: could be [**1-20**] stress, but
   concerning given clinical deterioration.
   -differential added on to yesterday
s CBC showed 50% atypical nucleated
   red cells, likely due to marrow stress
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring intubation and high levels of oxygen. She is currently on 100% FiO2 and pressure control ventilation. Multiple attempts at recruitment maneuvers have been made to improve oxygenation. The patient's propofol dosage is being decreased due to extremely elevated triglyceride levels. Thoracic consultation was obtained to check for pneumothorax and the possibility of placing bilateral chest tubes.

The patient's anemia has improved after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells, but further transfusion may be necessary if hemoglobin levels drop below 21. Hypotension continues to be a concern, and the patient requires IV fluid boluses and levophed as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65. The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be due to stress or marrow stress, and further investigation is needed.

Transaminitis is likely due to pentamidine use, which has been discontinued for two days. Decreasing steroid doses are being considered due to the patient's clinical improvement. The patient's leg edema is likely related to low albumin levels. Hyponatremia is stable between 131-135, and"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2183-8-30**] 04:15 AM
   -goal PaO2>55, goal O2 sat>90%. Used derecruitment and  came down.
   increased minute ventilation to 34. Stable gas.
   -discussed case in M&M, no other real changes in management. Have
   decided to slightly wean down on steroids. Changed to 60mg x 2 doses
   today, 40mg tonight for 3rd dose; switching to 40mg TID
   -For increased LFT's, consulted hepatology-think its ischemic in origin
   and just want to trend LFTs for now. Likely [**1-20**] pentamidine. Other
   possibility is micofungin-- ID said OK to d/c. Might consider changing
   bactrim to clinda/primaquine if still suspect medication effect on
   LFT's.
   Sent hepatitis serologies (?in the setting of steroids could have some
   reactivation of hepatitis B or C?)
   -ID does not feel strongly about a HIDA.
   -Had [**3-22**] twitches even with cisatracurium. Paralytic was d/c'ed (not

   respiratory failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status
   worsening, now on 100% FiO2.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Still on 100% FiO2 and on pressure control.
   -Several attempts at recruitment maneuvers overnight in an attempt to
   improve oxygenation.  Did have PaO2 of 55. Increased PEEP to 16 to
   increase tidal volumes
   -continue current vent settings for now; recheck ABG's q4h as necessary
   for SpO2<90
   -paralytics stopped yesterday and pt not breathing against vent. Also
   attempting to come down on her propofol, since extremely elevated TG's.
   -thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and are aware of pt. If there is concern
   for ptx they should be paged and will come place b/l chest tubes stat.
   The are following
 came by last night to check in.
   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly
   -rheum continues to follow
   -ID said OK to dc micafungin in light of LFT's (done yesterday); might
   consider switching bactrim to clinda/primaquine if LFT's remain
   elevated
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued.
   -continue to follow pending cultures, will reculture
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 15 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue Solumedrol but decrease from 60TID to 40TID
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays.

   #Anemia: Patient with acute drop in HCT from 22 to 16. repeated x 2.
   Also reflected in Hgb. s/p 2 units and Hct increased to 27.
   Guiac positive stool for hospitalization. No bloody ET secretions. No
   oozing anywhere. other coags/plts stable. Hemolysis labs negative. Note
   50% atypical reds from marrow stress. Had been hemodynamically stable
   until not oxygenating well.
   -will continue to trend q8h; Hct <25, will transfuse
   - No bleeding in NG lavage, will relavage.

   #Hypotension: required boluses overnight despite little diuresis with
   lasix. Off levophed.
   -maintain MAP>65 with IVF boluses and levophed as needed
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   -continue to follow rheum recommendation
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of
   resolving ischemia, as proposed by hepatology
   -f/u hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   -d/c'ed micafungin b/c can cause increase in LFT's in <5%

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Her respiratory status has been worsening, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She is currently on 100% FiO2 and pressure control ventilation. 

The patient has several complications including hypotension, anemia, pneumomediastinum, lactic acidosis, transaminitis, and hyponatremia. The hypotension requires IV fluid boluses and levophed as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. The anemia is acute with a drop in hematocrit from 22 to 16, possibly secondary to blood loss. The pneumomediastinum is likely due to PEEP and PCP but could also be related to esophageal rupture. The lactic acidosis is new and could be related to hypovolemia/bleeding or gallbladder issues. The transaminitis is likely due to pentamidine, which has been discontinued. The hyponatremia is stable between 131-135 and will be trended.

The patient's ILD and dermatomyositis are being managed by rheumatology, and there is a question of pancreatic mass but subsequent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was"

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 7947**] remained tachycardic to the 150s throughout the day.  She
   has continued to require levophed
 vasopressin was also added today
   with favorable effect.  Over the course of the day, she has had
   worsening metabolic acidosis with rising lactate.  These have leveled
   off over the last several hours.  Scenario worrisome for sepsis vs gut
   ischemia vs hemodynamic effects of pneumomediastinum vs occult bleed.
   Broad spectrum abx reinstituted, has been transfused and had ongoing
   fluid resuscitation.  Oxygenation somewhat stable with sats in low to
   mid 90s, but remains paralyzed and on 1.0 FIO2 with PEEP of 16.  Needs
   PEEP to maintain oxygenation but has worsening subcutaneous emphysema
   in neck.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to experience difficulties with oxygenation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires maximal levels of ventilatory support, indicating ongoing difficulties with oxygenation. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage.

2. Tachycardia/Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent tachycardia and hypotension, which may be due to ongoing blood loss, sepsis, or other underlying causes. This can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has stable pneumomediastinum, which refers to air leakage into the mediastinum. If not managed appropriately, it can progress and cause further respiratory complications.

4. Tranaminitis: The patient has elevated transaminase levels, indicating liver dysfunction. This can be attributed to shock liver or the use of pentamidine. Monitoring liver function and seeking hepatology input is necessary to prevent further liver damage.

5. PCP: The patient has PCP infection, for which Bactrim was prescribed. Inadequate treatment or resistance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and continues to have difficulties with oxygenation. She is currently on maximal levels of ventilator support, requiring high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. Her blood pressure is unstable, and she is tachycardic. There is concern about ongoing blood loss, and she has been transfused with additional units of blood. She also has elevated lactate levels, indicating possible hypoperfusion. The patient is sedated and paralyzed due to propofol and cisatracurium, respectively. She has a history of constipation but no other significant medical history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, indicating possible low blood flow to vital organs.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 22 to 16 g/dL, suggesting acute blood loss.
3. Fever: The patient has a high temperature, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
4. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, which could be exacerbated by her current condition or medications.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. She was found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and was intubated for increased work of breathing and respiratory failure. The patient's clinical status has been worsening, requiring high levels of oxygen and the use of paralytics to assist with ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on 100% FiO2 and now on assisted control (AC) mode. Paralytics were restarted due to some breathing against the ventilator. Thoracic consultation was obtained, and they will be paged if there is concern for pneumothorax.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient received 10 liters of intravenous fluid (IVF) yesterday. Vasopressors are being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65. Levophed and vasopressin could be considered for tachycardia.
3. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 22 to 16, possibly due to blood loss. She received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her HCT increased to 27. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the bleeding.
4. Lactic Acidosis: The patient developed lactic acidosis this morning, likely secondary to sepsis and hypovolemia.
5. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level increased from 0.4 to 1.3 over the past 2-3 days, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to poor perfusion.
6. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum on chest X-ray, which is likely due to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Esophageal rupture is also a concern, but there are no signs of infection.
7. ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with Gottron's papules, helotropic rash, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and CT findings suggestive of a pancreatic mass. However, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was negative for malignancy.
8. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, possibly due to pentamidine or sepsis.
9. Hypertriglyceridemia: The patient had elevated triglyceride levels likely due to propofol.
10. Leg Edema: The patient has bilateral leg edema, which could be due to hypoalbuminemia.
11. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is stable between 131-135.

 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status
   worsening, now on 100% FiO2.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Still on 100% FiO2 and now on AC.
   -paralytics restarted yesterday b/c some breathing against vent.
   -thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and are aware of pt. If there is concern
   for ptx they should be paged and will come place b/l chest tubes stat.
   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly; might
   consider switching bactrim to clinda/primaquine if LFT's remain
   elevated
   -ID said OK to dc micafungin in light of LFT's (done yesterday)
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued 2 days ago and then restarted
   yesterday in light of hypotension and concern for septic shock
   -continue to follow pending cultures, will reculture
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 16 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue slow salumedrol taper, currently at 40TID
   .
   #Hypotension/tachycardia: gave 10L of IVF yesterday
   -maintain MAP>65 with IVF boluses and levophed and vasopressin. could
   consider switching to neo for tachycardia.
   -continue to f/u cultures and crits
   .
   #Anemia: Patient with acute drop in HCT from 22 to 16. repeated x 2.
   Also reflected in Hgb. s/p 2 units and Hct increased to 27, Hct 24 this
   AM
   Guiac positive stool for hospitalization (likely [**1-20**] ulcer). No bloody
   ET secretions. No oozing anywhere. other coags/plts stable. Hemolysis
   labs negative.  50% atypical reds from marrow stress. Had been
   hemodynamically stable until not oxygenating well.  Concern for some
   occult bleed we are not seeing, especially in light of abdominal
   distension.
   -will continue to trend q8h; Hct <25, will transfuse
   - No bleeding in NG lavage, will relavage.
   -continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: new this am
   -likely [**1-20**] to above issues: sepsis/hypovolemia
   .
   # Oliguric acute renal failure: pt c cr bump from 0.4 to 1.3 in past
   2-3 days. Likely ATN [**1-20**] poor perfusion.
   -try to keep maps >65 c pressors and IV boluses
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays, perhaps
   improved this am.
   -will re-check CXR [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of
   resolving ischemia, as proposed by hepatology
   -f/u hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   -d/c'ed micafungin b/c can cause increase in LFT's in <5%
   .
   #hypertriglyceridemia: [**1-20**] propofol, which has been discontinued.
   .
   # leg edema: cxr does not look fluid overloaded.
   -bilateral LENI's negative and CTA all negative for DVT/PE. Maintaining
   good O2 sats on AC. Not large concern for new PE right now.
   -likely edema is [**1-20**] low albumin
    .
     #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, stable between 131-135.
   -continue to trend sodium, follow lytes.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   -stopped all oral meds at this point, until sure will not be
   reparalyzed
    .
   #Elevated PTT: continue to trend. seems to stay between 40-70.
   -trend coags
   -hep sc BID
   .
   #Eye care
erythromycin ophthalmic ointment
   .
   #Constipation: stooling appropriately on current regimen s/p soap suds
   enema.
    # FEN
Tube feeds DC-ed while paralyzed.  PO meds discontinued, will
   re-start when sure will not add back paralytics.  Gave lasix yesterday
   but didn't really put out. IVF boluses as needed for hypotension.
   Replete electrolytes PRN.

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status
   worsening, now on 100% FiO2.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Remains on 100% FiO2 and now on AC.  PEEP 16.
   -paralytics restarted yesterday b/c some breathing against vent.
   -thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and are aware of pt. If there is concern
   for ptx they should be paged and will come place b/l chest tubes stat.
   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly; might
   consider switching bactrim to clinda/primaquine if LFT's remain
   elevated
   -ID said OK to dc micafungin in light of LFT's (done yesterday)
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued 2 days ago and then restarted
   yesterday in light of hypotension and concern for septic shock.  Will
   continue for now.
   -continue to follow pending cultures, re-cultured yesterday.
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 16 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue slow salumedrol taper, currently at 40TID.  Reduce to 30 TID
   today.
   .
   #Hypotension/tachycardia: gave 10L of IVF yesterday
   -maintain MAP>65 with IVF boluses and levophed and vasopressin.
   -continue to f/u cultures and crits
   -DC albuterol nebs given significant tachycardia.
   .
   #Anemia: Patient with acute drop in HCT from 22 to 16. repeated x 2.
   Also reflected in Hgb. s/p 2 units and Hct increased to 27, Hct 24 this
   AM, coffee grounds from NGT this morning.  Will transfuse 1 unit PRBC.
   - other coags/plts stable. Hemolysis labs negative.  50% atypical reds
   from marrow stress. Had been hemodynamically stable until not
   oxygenating well.  Concern for some occult bleed we are not seeing,
   especially in light of abdominal distension.
   -will continue to trend q8h; Hct <25, will transfuse
   - No bleeding in NG lavage, will relavage.
   -continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -DC heparin subQ
 still on pneumoboots.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: new this am
   -likely [**1-20**] to above issues: sepsis/hypovolemia.
   .
   # Oliguric acute renal failure: pt c cr bump from 0.4 to 1.3 in past
   2-3 days. Likely ATN [**1-20**] poor perfusion.
   -try to keep maps >65 c pressors and IV boluses.
   -will consider consulting renal
 discuss today.
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely with serial
   x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt becoming more difficult to
   oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.) Pneumomediastinum likely [**1-20**]
   PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**] esophageal rupture but would
   expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays.
   -will re-check CXR [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   .
   #transaminitis: Possibly due to pentamidine, DC-ed for 2 days now.
   Also possibly from shock liver.  Massive fluid resusc yesterday.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of
   resolving ischemia, as proposed by hepatology
   -f/u hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   -d/c'ed micafungin b/c can cause increase in LFT's in <5%
   .
   #hypertriglyceridemia: likely [**1-20**] propofol, which has been
   discontinued.
   .
   # leg edema: cxr does not look fluid overloaded.
   -bilateral LENI's negative and CTA all negative for DVT/PE. Maintaining
   good O2 sats on AC. Not large concern for new PE right now.
   -likely edema is [**1-20**] low albumin
    .
     #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, stable between 131-135.
   -continue to trend sodium, follow lytes.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   -stopped all oral meds at this point, until sure will not be
   reparalyzed
    .
   #Elevated PTT: continue to trend. seems to stay between 40-70.
   -trend coags
   -hep sc BID
   .
   #Eye care
erythromycin ophthalmic ointment
   .
   #Constipation: stooling appropriately on current regimen s/p soap suds
   enema.
    # FEN
Tube feeds DC-ed while paralyzed.  PO meds discontinued, will
   re-start when sure will not add back paralytics.  Gave lasix yesterday
   but didn't really put out. IVF boluses as needed for hypotension.
   Replete electrolytes PRN.  Check electrolytes this afternoon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD), admitted for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient continues to have ongoing lactic acidosis, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 1.0, PEEP of 16, and a rate of 34 breaths per minute. The patient's condition is critical, and there are concerns about impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and potential complications such as hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating despite being on maximum support. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation due to the development of effusions.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggests the possibility of an underlying infection. The source could be gallbladder or gut ischemia/bacterial translocation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The worsening renal function indicates acute kidney injury, likely due to hypoperfusion. CVVH may be needed if the patient can tolerate it hemodynamically.
4. Pneumomediastinum: Although stable"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient continues to have difficulties with oxygenation, worsening metabolic acidosis, and worsening acute renal failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted control, paralytics, and high-flow oxygen. She has tachycardia and hypotension, for which she is receiving two pressors. There is evidence of blood loss anemia and ongoing blood loss from the oral gastric tube, necessitating blood transfusion. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and she may require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She also has evidence of pneumomediastinum but is stable. There are concerns about potential complications such as occult infection, gallbladder vs gut ischemia/bacterial translocation. The patient has elevated lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. She has a history of constipation and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition is critical, and she has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation is worsening due to effusions, limiting her ability to breathe adequately.
2. Tachycardia/Hypotension: The patient's heart rate is elevated,"

   -now back on Bactrim after switching to Pentamidine briefly
   -rheum continues to follow
   -ID said OK to dc micafungin in light of LFT's (done yesterday); might
   consider switching bactrim to clinda/primaquine if LFT's remain
   elevated
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued yesterday. Will restart in
   light of hypotension and concern for septic shock
   -continue to follow pending cultures, will reculture
   -may speak to husband about possible trach in future (now day 15 of
   intubation), pending appropriate clinical scenario.  Clearly not
   appropriate with current respiratory status.
   -continue Solumedrol taper, 30 TID today

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD).
- She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).
- The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, requiring intubation and high levels of supplemental oxygen.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted breaths, and paralytics have been restarted due to some breathing against the ventilator.
- The patient's blood cultures were taken, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were restarted due to concern for septic shock.
- She has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, requiring IV fluid boluses and vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
- The patient has anemia, likely secondary to blood loss, and has received additional packed red blood cells.
- Her lactic acidosis is suspected to be due to poor perfusion or a gallbladder source.
- Oliguric kidney injury is also present, with a creatinine bump from 0.4 to 1.3 in the past few days, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion.
- Pneumomediastinum was noted on X-ray but has stabilized without any interventions.
- The patient has dermatomyositis and ILD, with elevated CK levels and"

   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Still on 100% FiO2, AC.  Sats overnight mostly high 80's, low 90's.
   -remains on paralytics.
   -thoracic surgery has been following.
   -on Bactrim, vanco, cefepime, cipro - all four were changed to renal
   dosing.
   -rheum continues to follow
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued yesterday. Will restart in
   light of hypotension and concern for septic shock
   -continue to follow pending cultures, recultured yesterday.
   -continue Solumedrol taper, 30 TID yesterday
   .
   #Hypotension/wide complex tachycardia: Starting at 1:30 am, had several
   episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, associated with slight decrease
   in blood pressure.
   -no intervention to this point.  Amiodarone was not considered given
   already significant hepatic injury.
   -discussed with cardiology - could consider cardioversion if necessary.
   -discussed with patient's husband - she remains DNR, but cardioversion
   is a treatment option.
   -albuterol DC-ed
   .
   #Anemia: Patient with falling crit, concerned for stress ulcer
   bleeding, stool guaiac pos.
   -received 1 unit PRBC yesterday with appropriate bump in HCT
   -will continue to trend q12h; Hct <25, will transfuse

   -now on pressors, avoiding fluid repletion given already massive fluid
   overload.

   #Oliguric renal failure: creatinine jump from 0.4 to 1.9 in past
   several days. Likely ATN [**1-20**] poor perfusion, but could also be from
   nephrotoxicity.
   -vancomycin level dramatically elevated today.
   -try to keep maps >65 with pressors.
   -consult renal today.
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays.
   -will re-check CXR [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   -continue to follow rheum recommendation
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of
   resolving ischemia, as proposed by hepatology
   -f/u hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   -d/c'ed micafungin b/c can cause increase in LFT's in <5%
   .
   # leg edema: cxr does not look fluid overloaded.
   -bilateral LENI's negative and CTA all negative for DVT/PE. Maintaining
   good O2 sats on AC. Not large concern for new PE right now.
   -likely edema is [**1-20**] low albumin
     #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, stable between 131-135.
   -continue to trend sodium, follow lytes.

   # Osteoporosis:
   -stopped all oral meds at this point, until sure will not be
   reparalyzed
    .
   #Elevated PTT: continue to trend. seems to stay between 40-70.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of recently diagnosed dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She was admitted with progressive hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and she is currently on 100% FiO2. She remains intubated for increased work of breathing and respiratory failure.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening despite being on 100% FiO2. She is still on paralytics and remains intubated.
2. Hypotension/Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of wide-complex tachycardia associated with slight decreases in blood pressure. No intervention has been done so far due to significant hepatic injury.
3. Anemia: The patient has a falling crit and concern for stress ulcer bleeding, with a positive stool guaiac.
4. Lactic Acidosis: Newly developing lactic acidosis, unclear source, considering hepatic hypoperfusion, infection, or hypovolemia/bleeding.
5. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has increased from 0.4 to 1.9 in the past few days. It is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor perfusion or nephrotoxicity.
6. Pneumomediastinum: Noted on X-ray, likely due to PEEP and PCP, but also could be esophageal rupture. Stabilized and being closely monitored.
7. ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient has gottron's papules, helotropic rash, elevated CK, and a CT torso showing a question of pancreatic mass, but subsequent EUS was negative.
8. Transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been discontinued for 2 days. RUQ showed gallbladder edema, possibly from hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, or cholecystitis.
9. Leg Edema: CXR does not show fluid overload, and CTA is negative for DVT/PE. The edema is likely due to low albumin.
10. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is stable between 131-135. It is being closely monitored.
11. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis is being managed by stopping all oral medications until further evaluation.
12. Elevated PTT: The patient's PTT is elevated and being trended. Sub Q heparin has been discontinued.

The patient's social support system includes [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 563**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 564**], LICSW, #[**Numeric Identifier 565**], who has been following the patient's care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and concern for septic shock have led to the restart of antibiotics.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's episodes of wide-complex tachycardia could progress to more serious cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has PCP, which can lead to pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and positive stool guaiac suggest gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Sepsis: The patient's lactic acidosis and other signs indicate a potential septic state."

   Assessment and Plan
   Shortly before morning rounds, the patient acutely decompensated, went
   into another wide complex tachycardia, persistent, with decreasing
   blood pressures.  Resuscitation was attempted, but without chest
   compressions given DNR status.  She developed profound hypotension,
   PEA.  Amiodarone was bolus and drip was started, and she was started on
   multiple pressors.  Her blood pressure responded briefly, but she
   became persistently hypotensive again with a new bradycardia and
   worsening hypoxia.
   At this point a discussion was held with the patient
s husband, and
   aggressive care was withdrawn.  She expired shortly afterward.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities and allergies to specific medications. 

During the overnight period, the patient experienced several significant events. At 01:30 AM, an EKG showed wide complex tachycardia, which resolved spontaneously after five seconds. This was followed by another episode lasting a few minutes. The patient also had a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.

In the morning rounds, the patient had an episode of decreased oxygen saturation, down to the mid-80s. A recruitment maneuver and switch to pressure control mode were attempted, but no new findings were observed on the stat X-ray. The patient's oxygen saturation eventually stabilized at 93-94%, although there was an increase in CO2 with decreased pH. The patient continued to have tachycardia ranging from the high 130s to 140 throughout the day. The patient's heart rate remained consistently around 140, while blood pressure stayed fairly stable.

The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells, resulting in a hematocrit rise from 21 to 25.8%. An 8 pm ABG showed a pH of 7.15, PaCO2 of 57, and PaO2 of 70. Antibiotics were adjusted for renal dos"

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient is a 57y/o F with a PMH of recently
   diagnosed dermatomyositis and ILD admitted with progressive hypoxic
   respiratory failure found to have PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5925**].  Respiratory status
   worsening, now on 100% FiO2.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Intubated for increased work of
   breathing, respiratory failure.  Clinical status worsening.
   -Still on 100% FiO2, AC.  Sats overnight mostly high 80's, low 90's.
   -remains on paralytics.
   -thoracic surgery has been following.
   -on Bactrim, vanco, cefepime, cipro - all four were changed to renal
   dosing.
   -rheum continues to follow
 vanco, cefepime, cipro all discontinued yesterday. Will restart in
   light of hypotension and concern for septic shock
   -continue to follow pending cultures, recultured yesterday.
   -continue Solumedrol taper, 30 TID yesterday
   .
   #Hypotension/wide complex tachycardia: Starting at 1:30 am, had several
   episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, associated with slight decrease
   in blood pressure.
   -no intervention to this point.  Amiodarone was not considered given
   already significant hepatic injury.
   -discussed with cardiology - could consider cardioversion if necessary.
   -discussed with patient's husband - she remains DNR, but cardioversion
   is a treatment option.
   -albuterol DC-ed
   .
   #Anemia: Patient with falling crit, concerned for stress ulcer
   bleeding, stool guaiac pos.
   -received 1 unit PRBC yesterday with appropriate bump in HCT
   -will continue to trend q12h; Hct <25, will transfuse
   -continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -SubQ heparin DC-ed yesterday.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: newly developing
   -unclear source - considering hepatic hypoperfusion, infection
   -lactic acidosis could also be [**1-20**] hypovolemia/bleeding as well - HR
   130's this morning, was at 140 for all of yesterday.
   -now on pressors, avoiding fluid repletion given already massive fluid
   overload.
   .
   #Oliguric renal failure: creatinine jump from 0.4 to 1.9 in past
   several days. Likely ATN [**1-20**] poor perfusion, but could also be from
   nephrotoxicity.
   -vancomycin level dramatically elevated today.
   -try to keep maps >65 with pressors.
   -consult renal today.
   .
   #Pneumomediastinum: Noted on x-ray, followed closely over the course of
   the day yesterday with serial x-rays. (ordered in the setting of pt
   becoming more difficult to oxygenate, unlikely that this is related.)
   Pneumomediastinum likely 2/2 PEEP and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8215**]. Could also be [**1-20**]
   esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
   -seems to have stabilized - no changes on serial Xrays.
   -will re-check CXR [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules,
   helotropic rash, elevated CK. Underwent evaluation for malignancy with
   CT torso with question of pancreatic mass however subsequent EUS was
   negative.  Records reviewed.
 negative EUS confirmed.
   -Amylase/Lipase slightly elevated, likely [**1-20**] propofol
   -rheum says no indication for cytoxan with path data showing worsening
   ILD
   -continue to follow rheum recommendation
   .
   #transaminitis: Likely due to pentamidine, which has now been
   discontinued for 2 days.
   -RUQ yesterday showed gallbladder edema
 could very well be from
   hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema, but radiology says cannot rule
   out cholecystitis.
   -HIDA would be next step to rule this out, but given current clinical
   setting, not indicated.  ID did not feel strongly about doing this.
   -Will continue to trend LFT
s, now decreasing, but could be because of
   resolving ischemia, as proposed by hepatology
   -f/u hepatitis serologies (?reactivation in setting of steroids)
   -d/c'ed micafungin b/c can cause increase in LFT's in <5%
   .
   # leg edema: cxr does not look fluid overloaded.
   -bilateral LENI's negative and CTA all negative for DVT/PE. Maintaining
   good O2 sats on AC. Not large concern for new PE right now.
   -likely edema is [**1-20**] low albumin
     #Hyponatremia
 sodium 132 today, stable between 131-135.
   -continue to trend sodium, follow lytes.
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   -stopped all oral meds at this point, until sure will not be
   reparalyzed
    .
   #Elevated PTT: continue to trend. seems to stay between 40-70.
   -DC-ed sub Q heparin yesterday.
   .
   #Eye care
erythromycin ophthalmic ointment
   .
    # FEN
Tube feeds DC-ed while paralyzed.  PO meds discontinued, will
   re-start when sure will not add back paralytics.  Gave lasix yesterday
   but didn't really put out. IVF boluses as needed for hypotension.
   Replete electrolytes PRN.

","The patient's progress note indicates several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on 100% FiO2 due to worsening respiratory status. This suggests a severe form of respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure, which could indicate shock or poor perfusion.

3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, which can be concerning for arrhythmias.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (HCT) and received a blood transfusion. This suggests acute blood loss or ongoing bleeding.

5. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has newly developing lactic acidosis, which can be caused by hypoperfusion, infection, or other factors.

6. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible acute kidney injury (ATN) or nephrotoxicity.

7. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum on chest X-ray, likely secondary to mechanical ventilation and pulmonary capillary permeability.

8. Intestinal Lung Disease (ILD): The patient has a history of dermatomyositis and ILD, which can be associated with pulmonary capillary leak syndrome.

9. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, possibly due"
