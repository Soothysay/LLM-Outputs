   IMAGING:
   R hand xray:
   The 3^rd MCP joint is quite well maintained without convincing
   erosions. Degenerative change is seen involving the first CMC as well
   as the second DIP joint. Some narrowing is also seen involving several
   other DIP and PIP joints.
   L shoulder xray:
   There is sclerosis, with narrowing and some irregularity involving the
   glenohumeral joint. This may merely reflect degenerative changes,
   thought the possibility of an indolent infection cannot be excluded.
   MRI might be helpful for further evaluation.
   CXR:
   In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
   substantial clearing of the right upper lung opacification. This
   suggests expectoration of a mucous plug with relief of volume loss.
   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo F w/ CAD, ischemic [**Numeric Identifier 5346**] (EF 10%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, atrial
   fibrillation, CKD, with past history of DVT and PE on Coumadin who was
   recently discharged from the CCU ([**11-6**]) for CHF exacerbation c/b
   C.diff infection, who is now being transferred from [**Hospital 108**] hospital
   for Septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient developed worsening hypoxia as OSH
   requiring NRB and eventually intubation.   Patient has history of CHF
   with EF 10% which is the likely cause of her respiratory failure.  CXR
   yesterday with loss of volume on R side
 improved on subsequent CXR,
   suggesting clearing of mucous plug. Pt has sputum Cx with GPC in pairs,
   but no evidence of PNA on CXR.

   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o atrial fibrillation, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 2375**]
   Concerto C154DWK) [**12-24**], on coumadin.  Patient paced on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   obtain ECG to compare with previous ECG
   - cont home Amiodarone
   - hold dig, supratherapeutic level 2.6
   - hold coumadin for now for supratherapeutic INR
   - f/u INR
   .
   # Acute on CRF: Patient w/ baseline Cr 1.3-1.8, 2.4 on presentation.
   Likely related to CHF. FEUrea 35%.
   - monitor Cr
   .
   # H/o DVT/PE: Patient has h/o DVT/PE currently on coumadin and has a
   [**Location (un) **] filter in place.  Supratherapeutic INR, now improved to 3.3
   with FFP.
   - coumadin held for now
   - f/u INR
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine.
   .
   # Allopurinol:  Patient on Allopurinol, unclear why. Right 3^rd MCP
   joint swelling may be related to gout, but shoulder tap shows
   pseudogout.
   # FEN: NPO, tube feeds, replete lytes PRN
   .

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Repeat chest x-ray demonstrates resolution of atalectasis and volume
   loss like due to resolution of a mucus plug. INR rose to a high of 11.2
   yesterday for which she received 5 mg SQ Vitamin K. Repeat INR is 3.3
   this am. MRSA grew in the left shoulder joint effusion and so
   antibiotics have been changed to IV Vancomycin. Ortho stopped by
   yesterday and aspirated/washed out the left shoulder. They felt it was
   not necessary to do a diagnostic tap on the right third finger
   erythema. BPs have been low in the last 24 hours and so low dose
   dopamine has been used and Milrinone held. This am   ABG looked good on
   PS 12 and 40% fIO2 and so we will reduce the sedation and check a RSBI
   followed by extubation if possible. Blood cultures are also positive
   for Gm pos cocci in clusters likely the same staph as in the shoulder.
   We will decrease her lasix drip today and aim for even to slightly
   negative fluid balance. Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] has been made aware of the patient's
   condition and will resume her care in the am tomorrow.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11005**], [**Doctor Last Name 810**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was recently discharged from the CCU for CHF exacerbation and was readmitted to the ICU for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient developed respiratory failure due to worsening hypoxia, which led to the need for nonrebreather mask (NRB) and eventually intubation. The patient's history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10% is likely the cause of her respiratory failure. The chest X-ray showed clearing of the right upper lung opacification, suggesting expectoration of a mucous plug with relief of volume loss.

The patient also has a septic joint with MRSA infection in the left shoulder and hemarthrosis. Orthopedic aspiration of the left shoulder joint was performed. Blood cultures were positive for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA. The patient's INR was supratherapeutic, so fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was transfused to correct it.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is currently on Coumadin with a supratherapeutic INR, now improved to 3.3 with FFP. Cou"

   IMAGING:
   R hand xray:
   The 3^rd MCP joint is quite well maintained without convincing
   erosions. Degenerative change is seen involving the first CMC as well
   as the second DIP joint. Some narrowing is also seen involving several
   other DIP and PIP joints.
   L shoulder xray:
   There is sclerosis, with narrowing and some irregularity involving the
   glenohumeral joint. This may merely reflect degenerative changes,
   thought the possibility of an indolent infection cannot be excluded.
   MRI might be helpful for further evaluation.
   CXR:
   In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
   substantial clearing of the right upper lung opacification. This
   suggests expectoration of a mucous plug with relief of volume loss.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure (EF 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient was recently discharged from the CCU for a congestive heart failure exacerbation complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. She is now being transferred from another hospital for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed worsening hypoxia and required nonrebreather (NRB) and eventually intubation. The patient has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%, which is the likely cause of her respiratory failure. The chest X-ray yesterday showed loss of volume on the right side but improved on subsequent chest X-rays, suggesting clearing of a mucous plug. Sputum culture with gram-positive cocci in pairs, but no evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray.

2. Septic Joint: The patient has a positive Staphylococcus aureus in the left shoulder. The patient also had hemarthrosis of the left shoulder. Orthopedic performed aspiration of the left shoulder on [**2179-11-21**]. Continue vancomycin.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in"

   for Septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.
   # Hypotension: low BP requiring pressor support: dopamine and
   dobutamine.  Etiology likely multifactorial shock from sepsis (MRSA
   bacteremia and septic shock) and cardiogenic with EF of 10%. On RV
   catheterization [**11-22**]; CVL > 17 suggesting that hypovolemia is not
   playing significant role in hypotension
   - wean dobutamine and dopamine to maintain MAP > 60
   - cont abx coverage with vancomycin
   - source control with joint aspiration/ washout
   - aggressive diuresis role with -1 to 2 L/day as tolerated by BP
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient developed worsening hypoxia as OSH
   requiring NRB and eventually intubation.   Patient has history of CHF
   with EF 10% which is the likely cause of her respiratory failure.  CXR
   yesterday with loss of volume on R side
 improved on subsequent CXR,
   suggesting clearing of mucous plug. Pt has sputum Cx with GPC in pairs,
   but no evidence of PNA on CXR.  Saturating well on minimal vent

   - bedside aspiration planned for today
   - hold anticoagulation with warfarin pending plan for possible OR
   washout
   # Bacteremia: OSH blood cultures positive today for GPC in
   clusters/pairs, likely MRSA with likely source septic glenohumeral
   joint.  Other possible etiologies PNA (GPC in sputum), UTI, line
   infection.  Picc line placed at OSH replaced yesterday with central
   cordis
   - continue IV Vanc

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for a congestive heart failure exacerbation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. She is now being transferred from another hospital for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, septic joint, bacteremia, coronary artery disease, pump failure, rhythm disturbances, acute-on-chronic renal failure, history of DVT/PE, hypothyroidism, allopurinol use, feeding, access, and prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine and dobutamine. The etiology of hypotension is multifactorial, including sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and septic shock) and cardiogenic shock due to a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated at 17 mmHg, suggesting that hypovolemia is not significantly contributing to the hypotension. The plan is to wean the dobutamine and dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

2. Respiratory"

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient was recently discharged from the CCU for congestive heart failure exacerbation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. She is being transferred from another hospital for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient developed worsening hypoxia and required nonrebreather mask and eventually intubation. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%, which is likely causing her respiratory failure. A chest X-ray showed improvement on subsequent imaging, suggesting clearing of a mucous plug. The patient's sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci in pairs, but there were no signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray.

The patient has a septic joint in her left shoulder, with positive Staphylococcus aureus culture. She also had hemarthrosis of the left shoulder, and an orthopedic aspiration was performed on the left shoulder joint on November 21st. The patient's blood cultures from the oxygen saturation monitor lines were positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly female with multiple comorbidities including heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with symptoms of sepsis and acute respiratory failure, and was found to have coagulopathy and acute-on-chronic heart failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. She is also on vasopressor support with dopamine and dobutamine to maintain adequate blood pressure and cardiac output.

The patient has a history of chronic pain, for which pain control measures should be considered. Additionally, the patient's skin integrity is compromised due to impaired circulation, and efforts should be made to prevent further complications.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of heart function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent these complications and optimize the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of CAD, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, CKD, DVT, and PE. She was recently discharged from the CCU for CHF exacerbation with a C.diff infection. The patient is now being transferred from another hospital for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension requiring pressor support with dopamine and dobutamine. Etiology is likely multifactorial shock from sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and septic shock) and cardiogenic with an EF of 10%. Right heart catheterization showed CVP > 17 suggesting that hypovolemia is not playing a significant role in hypotension.

The patient also developed respiratory failure with worsening hypoxia as OSH, requiring NRB and eventually intubation. The patient has a history of CHF with EF 10% which is the likely cause of her respiratory failure. Chest X-ray showed loss of volume on the right side but improved on subsequent CXR, suggesting clearing of mucous plug. Sputum cultures grew GPC in pairs, but there is no evidence of PNA on CXR. The patient is saturating well on minimal vent settings with minimal sedatives.

The patient has a septic joint with positive staph aureus in the left shoulder. Ortho performed aspiration of the L"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   hemodynamics appear stable on dopa and dba
   weaning off vent
   uop excellent off diuretics
   plan is for TEE today to rule out endocarditis
   ID consult for MRSA bacteremia
   full code for now but family requests that if prognosis for overcoming
   the acute decompensation/infection worsens, will consider DNR as per
   patient's stated wishes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of CAD, ischemic EF 10%, s/p V ICD, atrial fibrillation, CKD, DVT, and PE. She was recently discharged from the CCU for CHF exacerbation and is now being transferred for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia requiring intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension requiring pressor support, respiratory failure, septic joint, bacteremia, coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction, including renal failure or myocardial ischemia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to severe hypoxia or respiratory arrest, leading to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.
3. Septic Joint: The infection in the shoulder joint may spread to other joints or cause sepsis, leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and septic shock.
4. Bacteremia: The presence of MRSA bacteremia can lead to sepsis and septic shock, requiring aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and source control.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of orthopedic joint aspiration. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), coagulopathy, acute-on-chronic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, and pain control. The patient is currently receiving dobutamine and dopamine infusions to maintain MAP > 65 and improve cardiac output. A right internal jugular (IJ) catheter was placed, and a PICC line was pulled and sent for culture. The patient's blood cultures from OSH, sputum cultures, and joint fluid aspirate are pending. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 90/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's CVP is elevated at 17 mmHg, indicating fluid overload. The patient's fluid balance shows a net positive balance of 1,052 mL since midnight. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and ABG results of pH 7.53, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 334, and Ve of 8.8 L/min. The patient's labs reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, low platelet count of 169 K/uL, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.15 ng/mL. The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute-on-chronic heart failure, and chronic pain. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with possible progression to septic shock due to the presence of infection and systemic inflammatory response.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy leading to bleeding complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Acute heart failure exacerbation with possible cardiogenic shock due to the patient's low blood pressure and the need for isotropic support.
5. Impaired skin integrity with the risk of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown.
6. Chronic pain management due to the patient's history of chronic pain.
7. Potential complications related to the invasive lines and catheters in place, such as line infections or thrombosis.
8. The patient's fluid overload and elevated CVP indicate the need for careful fluid management to avoid worsening heart failure or pulmonary edema."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure (ejection fraction of 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the cardiac care unit for a heart failure exacerbation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is now being transferred from another hospital for septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine and dobutamine. The likely cause of hypotension is multifactorial shock from sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and septic shock) and cardiogenic with an EF of 10%. Right heart catheterization shows a central venous pressure (CVP) > 17, suggesting that hypovolemia is not playing a significant role in hypotension.

Plan: Wean dobutamine and dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, continue vancomycin coverage, perform joint aspiration/washout, and maintain aggressive diuresis with -1 to 2 L/day as tolerated by blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed worsening hypoxia as OSH requiring nonrebreather mask and eventually intubation. The patient has a history of congestive"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female who has been admitted to the ICU. She is intubated and sedated, with a history of multiple medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, heart failure, impaired skin integrity, and pain control. The patient has ongoing infections in both her blood and shoulder joint, with positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. She also has thrombus formation in her left atrial appendage. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although her blood pressure is on the lower side. She is receiving various medications and treatments to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which indicates an ongoing infection. If left untreated or if the infection spreads to other organs, it can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support her breathing. If there are any complications with the ventilator or if her respiratory function worsens, it could lead to further respiratory failure and potential respiratory arrest.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a bleeding disorder characterized by prolonged PT/INR and PTT. This increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or if the patient requires anticoagulant therapy.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic heart failure, indicating a worsening of her"

- The patient made a decision regarding Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI), which needs to be readdressed in the morning.
- Orthopedic consultation wants to reintubate for arthroscopy tomorrow and may consider hip replacement. However, the patient is unable to get an MRI due to an ICD (implanted cardiac device).
- The patient is experiencing multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and has had dopamine turned down. Potassium levels need to be repleted.
- Infectious disease consultation suggests aiming for vancomycin trough levels between 15-20, following the culture results, and considering arthrocentesis of the left hip to send joint fluid for culture and gram stain.
- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows a thrombus in the left atrial appendage but no vegetation. Further evaluation is required.
- Blood cultures from shoulder and blood show growth, sensitivities pending.
- The patient has allergies to no known drugs.
- The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2179-11-23**] at 08:45 AM.
- The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion at 1,250 units/hour.
- Other ICU medications include fentanyl and midazolam, administered on [**2179-11-23**] at 01:30 PM.
- Other medications are also listed.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated respiratory rate.
- Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are documented.
- Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment incomplete.
- Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.
- Radiology images are not provided.
- The patient has several problems including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, heart failure, impaired skin integrity, and pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening of sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, further respiratory failure or complications related to the arthroscopic procedure, coagulopathy-related bleeding events, exacerbation of heart failure, development of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown, and inadequate pain management."

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for congestive heart failure exacerbation complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented to the emergency department with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure that requires pressor support with dopamine. The etiology of hypotension is likely multifactorial, including sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and septic shoulder) and cardiogenic shock due to her low ejection fraction.

2. Septic Joint: The patient has a positive Staphylococcus aureus in her left shoulder joint. An aspiration of the left shoulder joint was performed, and arthroscopy of the left shoulder, right MCP, and left hip is planned for today.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's OSH blood cultures are positive for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA. The likely source of bacteremia is the septic glenohumeral joint. There is no evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) yesterday. Other possible etiologies include pneumonia (GPC"

   C.diff infection, admitted from OSH with septic shoulder joint (MRSA)
   and hypoxia, requiring intubation.
   # Hypotension: low BP requiring pressor support with dopamine (weaned
   off dobutamine).  Etiology likely multifactorial shock from sepsis
   (MRSA bacteremia and septic shoulder) and cardiogenic with EF of 10%.
   On RV catheterization [**11-22**]; CVL > 17 suggesting that hypovolemia is not
   playing significant role in hypotension
   - wean dopamine to maintain adequate end organ perfusion
   - cont abx coverage with vancomycin 1gm q 48hrs
   - source control with left shoulder/ hip washout/ aspiration
   - aggressive diuresis role with -1 to 2 L/day as tolerated by BP
   # Septic Joint:  Patient with +staph aureus in left shoulder.  Patient
   also had +hemarthrosis of left shoulder. Ortho performed aspiration of

   cardiogenic shock with volume overload .  Currently autodiuresing
   - strict I/Os  with aggressive diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - daily weights
   - consider restarting Lasix if output diminishes
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient currently extubated and maintaining
   adequate saturation on RA.  Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   mucus plugging and underlying CHF. Pt has sputum Cx with GPC in pairs,
   but no evidence of PNA on CXR.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - elective intubation for procedure tomorrow
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o atrial fibrillation, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 2375**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic ejection fraction of 10%, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for a congestive heart failure exacerbation complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented to the operating room with septic arthritis in her left shoulder, right metacarpophalangeal joint, and bacteremia with GPC. She underwent washout of the shoulder and aspiration of the hip, and a central cordis was placed. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support with dopamine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg and preserve adequate cardiac output. Etiology is likely multifactorial shock from sepsis and cardiogenic causes.
2. Septic Joint: The patient has positive staphylococcus aureus in her left shoulder, left hip, and right MCP. Source control has been achieved with washout of the shoulder and aspiration of the left hip. Continuous vancomycin coverage is recommended, along with follow-up on gram stain and culture from the left hip aspiration. Possible left hip washout tomorrow.
3. Bacteremia: OSH blood cultures are positive for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA, with the"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day ([**2179-11-25**]) I saw, examined and was physically present with
   the resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   I saw this patient with the CCU team on [**2179-11-25**].  She had her left hip
   aspirated and left shoulder washed.  Lots of purulent fluid in
   shoulder.  Antibiotics are continuing.  Ortho and ID following closely.
   She has been afebril with stable white count.  Hemodynamically stable.
   Will require some dopamine to maximize cardiac output to maximize
   antibiotic penetration into infected sites.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3179**]  on:[**2179-11-26**]

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine. The etiology is likely multifactorial, including sepsis and cardiogenic shock due to a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. It is important to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) to preserve cardiac output.

2. Sepsis: The patient has septic joints in the left shoulder and right MCP, as well as bacteremia with GPC. Source control measures, such as washout of the shoulder and aspiration of the hip, have been performed. Antibiotic coverage with vancomycin should be continued, and further surgical intervention may be required.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's EF of 10% indicates significant impairment of cardiac function, contributing to cardiogenic shock. Dobutamine may be used to maintain adequate cardiac output.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.3-1.8, but it increased to 2.4 on presentation. This suggests acute kidney injury, possibly related to CHF. Close monitoring of creatinine levels is necessary.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Although extubated now, there may still be some degree of pulmonary edema from hypervolemia. Lasix g"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was recently discharged from the CCU for a congestive heart failure exacerbation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) with septic joint in the left shoulder (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, septic joint, bacteremia, coronary artery disease, pump failure, respiratory failure, rhythm disturbances, acute on chronic renal failure, history of DVT/PE, hypothyroidism, allopurinol use, access issues, prophylaxis measures, and code status.

Some of the potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Sepsis: The presence of MRSA bacteremia and septic joint increases the risk of systemic infection and sepsis.
3. Cardiogenic shock: With a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, the patient is at risk of cardiogenic shock due"

   C.diff infection, admitted from OSH with septic shoulder joint (MRSA)
   and hypoxia, requiring intubation.
   # Hypotension: low BP requiring pressor support with dopamine (weaned
   off dobutamine).  Etiology likely multifactorial shock from sepsis
   (MRSA bacteremia and septic shoulder) and cardiogenic with EF of 10%.
   On RV catheterization [**11-22**]; CVL > 17 suggesting that hypovolemia is not
   playing significant role in hypotension
   - wean dopamine to maintain adequate end organ perfusion

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient presented with septic joint of the left shoulder, hypoxia, and cardiogenic shock. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring pressor support with dopamine, bacteremia likely due to MRSA, septic joint of the left shoulder, and possible endocarditis. The patient also has a history of ischemic heart disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%, atrial fibrillation, and an implanted bi-ventricular pacemaker. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/46 mmHg to 71/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has positive blood cultures for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA. 

The patient's plan includes weaning dopamine to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion, continuing vancomycin coverage, source control with left shoulder/hip washout/aspiration, aggressive diuresis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted from the emergency department with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation. She has multiple comorbidities and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine. The etiology is likely multifactorial shock from sepsis and cardiogenic causes. Measures have been taken to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 to preserve cardiac output.

2. Sepsis: The patient has positive staph aureus in the left shoulder, left hip, and right MCP joints. She underwent washout of the shoulder and MCP joints and aspiration of the left hip. Source control measures have been implemented, and vancomycin is being continued.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's OSH blood cultures are positive for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA. No evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was found, although an atrial thrombus may be infected. PICC line placement and central cordis replacement have been"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart failure (EF 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and hypoxia. The patient was recently discharged from the CCU for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and was admitted from the outside hospital (OSH) with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently in the ICU. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine. The etiology is likely multifactorial, including sepsis and cardiogenic causes. The patient's cardiac output needs to be maintained, and adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be preserved.

2. Septic Joint: The patient has positive staphylococcus aureus in the left shoulder, left hip, and right MCP joints. The patient underwent washout of the shoulder and MCP joints and aspiration of the left hip. Further surgical intervention may be necessary for the left hip.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has blood cultures positive for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA. There is no evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 11005**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5542**] remains very stable from the respiratory standpoint
   however, she has signifcant pain on her left shoulder and right MCP.
   While there is MRSA in her left hip, it is not very painful at the
   current time. A drain remains in the left shoulder. BPs are stable and
   she continues to spike temps. Blood cultures still positive for MRSA.
   Mitral HSM is unchanged. For her PAF she is in NSR on Coumadin, heparin
   and amio. Continue vanco and DA for SBP >100 mm Hg.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11005**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure (ejection fraction 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for a heart failure exacerbation caused by a Clostridium difficile infection and was admitted to the ICU from the operating room for septic joint (MRSA) and hypoxia requiring intubation.

The patient is currently being treated for multiple medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure that requires pressor support with dopamine. The etiology of the hypotension is likely multifactorial, including sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and septic shoulder/MCP) and cardiogenic shock due to a low ejection fraction.

2. Septic Joint: The patient has positive Staphylococcus aureus in the left shoulder, left hip, and right MCP. She underwent washout of the shoulder and MCP and aspiration of the left hip on 11/25/2179. She will continue on vancomycin, and a possible left hip washout is planned for tomorrow. Coumadin is being held pending further surgical intervention.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's OSH blood cultures are positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA, with the likely source being the septic"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 11005**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5542**] remains very stable from the respiratory standpoint
   however, she has signifcant pain on her left shoulder and right MCP.
   While there is MRSA in her left hip, it is not very painful at the
   current time. A drain remains in the left shoulder. BPs are stable and
   she continues to spike temps. Blood cultures still positive for MRSA.
   Mitral HSM is unchanged. For her PAF she is in NSR on Coumadin, heparin
   and amio. Continue vanco and DA for SBP >100 mm Hg.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11005**] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for congestive heart failure exacerbation secondary to Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted from the outside hospital with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient's current conditions include hypotension requiring pressor support with dopamine, bacteremia/ septic joint with positive blood cultures for GPC in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA, with a likely source being the septic glenohumeral joint. There is no evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), although an atrial thrombus may be infected. The patient has also had washout of the shoulder and right MCP, and aspiration of the left hip.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with right dominant system, mild instent restenosis of the left anterior descending artery stent, and occluded right coronary artery. There is no evidence of ischemic event precipitating cardiogenic shock.

The patient is currently hypervolemic after the operation with 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1.5 liters of fluid. The goal is to maintain urine output and continue with lasix to achieve a negative"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure (ejection fraction of 10%), ventricular assist device implantation, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for a heart failure exacerbation caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented to the hospital with septic arthritis of the left shoulder and hip, as well as hypoxia requiring intubation. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine. This may be due to multifactorial shock from sepsis and cardiogenic causes.
2. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a septic joint. Source control through washout of the infected joints is ongoing.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low ejection fraction (10%) and history of ischemic heart disease increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were elevated, and she has further renal impairment. This may be related to heart failure or sepsis.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient had initial respiratory failure likely secondary to mucus pl"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the cardiac care unit for a congestive heart failure exacerbation caused by Clostridium difficile infection.

The etiology is likely multifactorial, including sepsis from MRSA bacteremia and septic joint, as well as cardiogenic factors due to an ejection fraction of 10%. A right ventricular (RV) catheterization showed that hypovolemia is not playing a significant role in hypotension.

2. Bacteremia/Sep tic Joint: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters/pairs, likely MRSA. The source of infection is suspected to be the septic glenohumeral joint.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart failure (EF 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted from the operating room (OSH) with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including hypotension, bacteremia/septic joint, coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, rhythm disturbances, acute on chronic renal failure, history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hypothyroidism, and unclear reason for allopurinol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires pressor support with dopamine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 and preserve cardiac output.
2. Bacteremia/Sep tic Joint: The patient has MRSA bacteremia with likely sources in septic glenohumeral joint, left shoulder, left hip, and right MCP. Source control with left shoulder/hip washout/aspiration has been performed. Continuous surveillance with daily sets of blood cultures until negative is recommended.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD with a right dominant system, mild instent restenosis of the LAD BM stent, and occluded RCA. There is"

- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient is currently receiving dopamine at 2 mcg/kg/min, heparin sodium at 900 units/hour, and furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hour.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/53-91/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's weight is 71.5 kg, and height is 71 inches.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,550 mL, with 326 mL given through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 530 mL through oral intake, 1,020 mL through intravenous fluids, and 246 mL through other sources. Total output includes 1,970 mL of urine, 300 mL of blood products, and 25 mL of drainage from a wound. The fluid balance is negative at 420 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.
- ABG results are not provided.
- Physical examination findings are limited due to assessment not being performed on certain body systems such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others.
- Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 231 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 38 mg/dL, and decreased sodium level of 133 mg/dL.
- The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, heart failure, impaired skin integrity, and pain control issues.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate).
- Disposition is not mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient has ongoing infections, including a left hip infection and central line infection. If these infections worsen or spread, it could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than they are taking in. This could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory distress: The"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11095**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient stable from the rep standpoint. She remains on Vanco for widely
   disseminated MRSA. Left shoulder and right MCP are less painful. Left
   hip hurts only with movement. Will wean DA and follow BP. Resume
   Digoxin for rate control - INR is 2.2.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11095**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and a past history of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from the emergency department with septic shoulder joint and hypoxia, requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, bacteremia/ septic joint (likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - MRSA), coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure requiring pressor support with dopamine. The etiology of hypotension is multifactorial, including sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and possible large pericardial effusion.
2. Bacteremia/Septic Joint: The patient has positive blood cultures for GPC in clusters/pairs until November 25th, likely MRSA. The likely source of infection is the septic glenohumeral joint. There is no evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), although an atrial thrombus may be infected.

The patient was recently discharged from the CCU for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation complicated by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She was admitted to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

The etiology is likely multifactorial shock from sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and septic shoulder/MCP), cardiogenic with an EF of 10%, and possibly large pericardial effusion given the presence of a rub on examination. The patient underwent right ventricular (RV) catheterization, which showed a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17, suggesting that hypovolemia is not playing a significant role in hypotension.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was recently discharged from the cardiac care unit (CCU) for a CHF exacerbation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented to the emergency department with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, bacteremia/septic joint, coronary artery disease, pump failure, respiratory failure, rhythm disturbances, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient has undergone various interventions, including source control with left shoulder/hip washout/aspiration, placement of a central cordis line, and replacement of a PICC line. She is currently on multiple medications, including furosemide, heparin, digoxin, amiodarone, and lasix.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 104/56 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (10% EF), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for a heart failure exacerbation caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented to the hospital with septic arthritis of the left shoulder and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a possible measure of low cardiac output. Sepsis appears to be improving, and the patient tolerated the discontinuation of dopamine. However, close monitoring is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion.

2. Bacteremia/Sepic Joint: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters/pairs until November 25th, possibly due to a line infection. There was evidence of Staphylococcus aureus in the left shoulder, left hip, and right metacarpal, which were treated with washout and aspiration on November 25th. No evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), although an atrial thrombus may be infected. Continued IV vancomycin, trough pending today, and daily surveillance with two sets of cultures until negative are recommended.

3. Coronaries: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous inferior wall myocardial infarction (EF 10%), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. She was recently discharged from the CCU for congestive heart failure exacerbation and was admitted from the outpatient setting with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, bacteremia/septic joint, coronary artery disease, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and chronic renal failure. She also has a history of hypothyroidism, gout, and a vena cava filter in place for previous deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/57 mmHg to 114/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and an arterial blood gas of pH 7.30.

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic ejection fraction of 10%, and previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. She was admitted from the community for congestive heart failure exacerbation complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. She was recently discharged from the coronary care unit (CCU) for CHF exacerbation and was readmitted from the outpatient setting with septic shoulder joint (MRSA) and hypoxia, requiring intubation.

The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, bacteremia/septic joint, coronary artery disease, pump dysfunction, respiratory failure, rhythm disturbances, acute on chronic renal failure, history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hypothyroidism, gout, and a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, digoxin, aspirin, simvastatin, allopurinol, and levothyroxine. She is also receiving IV heparin for anticoagulation and has a central cordis line placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's ejection fraction is severely reduced (20%), indicating impaired cardiac function. This can lead to further cardiogenic shock and fluid overload.
2. Infection: The patient has had multiple"
