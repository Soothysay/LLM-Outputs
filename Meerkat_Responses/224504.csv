   study. There is no sign of free intraperitoneal air on this single
   supine
   view. Multiple distended loops of colon are seen, measuring up to 10
   cm. No
   definite pneumatosis is seen, though evaluation is limited by the large
   amount
   of stool throughout the colon. Note is made of IVC filter at the level
   of L1.
   IMPRESSION: Multiple distended loops of colon of uncertain
   significance. CT
   recommended for further evaluation.

   Assessment and Plan
   /P: 52 yo male with ALS, chronically vent dependent with G tube,
   presents with severe constipation, hematemesis and sepsis
   # Sepsis: Had fever to 102.5 upon arrival to ED. Per nursing home he
   has not been having fevers but was recently treated for ""leukocytosis""
   with unasyn and vanco.  Was intermittently being straight-cathed.
   Unclear where/when foley was placed. Also, has midline in place that
   was placed at outside facility on [**4-26**]. Likely source of infection is
   UTI, but also consider pneumonia given chronically vented and is having
   secretions. Also, consider C. diff given recent antibiotic and dilated
   colon.
   - if this is not new foley, then should replace
   - sputum culture
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - stool for C.diff
   - d/c midline
   - give ceftaz, vanco, flagyl to treat broadly given chronically vented
   and in a facility, has had pseudomonas in sputum, coag negative staph
   bacteremia in the recent past, and is at risk for bowel translocation
   given dilated bowel loops
   - Bolus IVFs to keep MAPS 60, UOP>50 cc/hr
   - place CVL if BPs remain low and has poor UOP
   - monitor lactate
   # Constipation: Patient has been having increasing abdominal
   distention. Seems that he has had chronic problem with constipation. No
   evidence of obstruction on KUB or CT scan.  Surgery saw in ED and
   disimpacted. Also, consider c.diff
   - Lactulose 30 ml QID, titrate to BM
   - prn enemas
   - NPO
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - monitor abdominal exam
   # Hematemesis:  Has history of bleed around G tube site. HCT currently
   stable. No output for NG or G-tube
   - Q6H HCT
   - GI aware and will likely scope
   - Hold ASA for now
   - 2 large bore PIVs, and CVL if needed
   - active type and crossmatch
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # Chronic vent dependence/respiratory failure: Currently satting well.
   Does have significant secretions
   - HOB >15 degrees
   - mouth care
   .
   # ALS: continue baclofen
   .
   # Psych: continue zoloft, remeron
   .
   # Glucose intolerance: Currently hold TFs. 1/2 dose Q6h regular insulin
   sliding scale
   .
   #FEN: Hold TFs for now, replete lytes
   .
   #ACCESS: d/c  left midline, PIV 18# x2
   .
   #PPx: SQ heparin, has IVC filter in
   .
   #CODE: full code, per OMR d/c summary. Has been seen by palliative care
   in the past, but did not want to partake in discussions. Would likely
   benefit from another palliative care consult and family meeting in Am

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ALS, who is ventilator dependent and has a G-tube. He presents with severe constipation, hematemesis, and sepsis. The patient has been experiencing fevers, which were initially treated with antibiotics. He also has a midline in place since April 26th. The likely sources of infection include UTI, pneumonia, and C. difficile. The patient's current medications include baclofen for ALS, zoloft and remeron for psychiatric issues, regular insulin for glucose intolerance, and heparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's family has been informed about his condition, and a palliative care consult is recommended.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to multiple factors such as chronic ventilator dependence, intermittent straight catheterization, presence of a midline, and potential urinary tract infection.
2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's chronic ventilator dependence, he is at risk for developing pneumonia, especially considering the presence of secretions and potential aspiration.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and dilated colon raise concerns for a C. difficile infection, which could lead to severe diarrhea and abdominal distention.
4. Constipation: The patient has a history of chronic constipation, and it is important to manage this issue to prevent further complications"

   has not been having fevers but was recently treated for ""leukocytosis""
   with unasyn and vanco.  Was intermittently being straight-cathed.
   Unclear where/when foley was placed. Also, has midline in place that
   was placed at outside facility on [**4-26**]. Likely source of infection is
   UTI, but also consider pneumonia given chronically vented and is having
   secretions. Also, consider C. diff given recent antibiotic and dilated
   colon. Pt given Vanc/ceftaz and flagyl. Received 1 dose of zosyn on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who is ventilator dependent and has a history of chronic constipation, recent antibiotic use, and intermittent straight catheterization. He presented with severe constipation, hematemesis, and sepsis. He was treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl. His current assessment includes multiple distended loops of colon on imaging, positive for gram-negative rods in sputum culture, and a high white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible infection. The source of infection is likely to be urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia, considering his chronic ventilation and secretions.
2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's chronic ventilation status and presence of secretions, there is a possibility of pneumonia.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and dilated colon on imaging raise concerns for C. diff infection.
4. Constipation: The patient has a history of chronic constipation, which may contribute to his abdominal distention and could lead to complications such as fecal impaction or perforation.
5. Hematemesis: The patient's history of bleeding due to ulceration around the G-tube site and current hematemesis require close monitoring and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who is chronically ventilator-dependent and has a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) in place. The patient presents with severe constipation, hematemesis, and sepsis but is currently hemodynamically stable. 

The patient has an infection caused by Proteus bacteria in his urine, which is being treated with a combination of antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The PICC line needs to be changed by interventional radiology due to being placed as a midline line.

The patient also has abdominal distention, likely due to chronic constipation. There is no evidence of obstruction on imaging, and the patient underwent disimpaction by surgery. Aggressive bowel regimen including lactulose and enemas is planned to manage the constipation.

Hematemesis is a result of ulceration around the G-tube site. Conservative management is being pursued at this time, monitoring for any signs of bleeding.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with good oxygenation but has significant secretions. Ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who is chronically ventilator-dependent and has a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). The patient presents with severe constipation, hematemesis, and sepsis. He is now hemodynamically stable. The patient has a Proteus infection in his urine, which is being covered with antibiotics. The PICC line needs to be changed over the wire due to being midline. Clostridium difficile is negative. The patient's white blood cell count has improved, and follow-up culture data is pending.

The patient also has abdominal distention due to chronic constipation. There is no evidence of obstruction on imaging, and the patient has been disimpacted by surgery. He is clinically improving with an aggressive bowel regimen.

Additionally, the patient has a history of bleeding due to ulceration around the G-tube site. His hemoglobin concentration is currently stable, and there is no output from the NG or G-tube. Conservative management is being pursued for the hematemesis, given the patient's infection and stable hemoglobin levels.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, but he is currently saturating well with supplemental oxygen. His respiratory secretions are pending culture. The patient's head of bed is being elevated, and mouth care is being provided. The plan is to wean down the FiO2 to 40%.

Other ongoing plans include continuing medications for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ALS, sepsis, respiratory secretions with gram-negative rods (GNR), Proteus urinary tract infection (UTI), and colonic distension. The patient's sepsis has resolved, and he is being treated for Proteus in the urine initially with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole. He received a dose of Zosyn upon arrival. The patient also has a drug rash, so the antibiotics will be switched to vancomycin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole until repeat Clostridium difficile toxin test is negative and sputum, urine cultures are available. Vancomycin will be continued for 48 hours after the last negative blood culture. 

The patient experienced hematemesis attributable to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but has not recurred. The plan is to cauterize if it recurs. The colonic distension has improved after disimpaction and gastric suction. PEG feeds will be restarted. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 107/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of ALS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics for a suspected Proteus urinary tract infection and colonic distension. He also has a drug rash and is being switched to a different antibiotic regimen. The patient's sepsis has resolved, but he remains at risk for complications due to his underlying conditions and current medical interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI): The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive lines make him susceptible to BSI.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has received multiple courses of antibiotics, increasing the risk of developing CDI.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
5. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's critical illness and medications such as PPIs may predispose him to stress ulcers and further gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Aggressive ventilation strategies can lead to lung injury and worsen respiratory function.
7. Sepsis and"
