","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with hypotension and hypoxia. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension at a rehabilitation facility. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and peripheral levophed in the emergency department, but her blood pressure remains unresponsive. The differential diagnosis includes septic shock from a pulmonary source, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock secondary to MI, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia with antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn), and further investigations are planned to rule out MI and PE. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection, and additional tests are needed to assess this. The patient also has microcytic anemia, acute renal failure (resolving), lactic acidosis (resolved), and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of COPD and is on digoxin and anticoagulants. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and communication with the family has been made.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and respiratory distress suggest the possibility of septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of immobility at the rehabilitation facility, there is a risk of developing a PE, which can lead to sudden onset respiratory distress and circulatory collapse.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with hypotension and hypoxia. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute respiratory distress, altered mental status, microcytic anemia, acute renal failure, lactic acidosis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of COPD and dementia. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and her blood cultures are pending. She is currently receiving IV fluids and vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low blood pressure and hypoxia could be indicative of adrenal insufficiency. However, her AM cortisol levels are within normal limits, making this less likely.
2. Cardiogenic shock secondary to MI: Although the patient's blood pressure did not respond to IV fluids, there is no mention of ECG changes or cardiac enzyme elevations to suggest an acute myocardial infarction.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's acute onset respiratory distress and hypoxia raise suspicion for a PE. Further evaluation, such as a CT angiogram, may be necessary if she does not improve with diuresis and other treatments.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's prolonged wheezing and respiratory distress could be due to a COPD flare-up. Nebulizer treatments, steroids, and diuretics have been initiated to manage her symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] yo F with hypotension and hypoxia.
   .
   #  Hypotension: BP at NH was 70/40. Despite IV fluids in ED, BP not
   responsive. Patient started on peripheral levophed in ED. Differential
   includes most likely septic shock from pulmonary source. Potential
   other etiologies that should always be considered are. Adrenal
   insufficiency, cardiogenic shock secondary to MI, PE to be considered.
   CXR shows infiltrate, concerning for pneumonia, along with SOB and
   cough. Started empirically on Vanc/Zosyn for pneumonia. Patient has
   ruled out for MI, cultures negative, and doesn't improve with abx,
   would consider CTA to rule out PE. AM cortisol within normal limits,
   making adrenal insufficiency less likely.
   -continue broad spectrum abx -Vanc and Zosyn
   -IV fluids to keep urine output > 50cc/hour, gentle as HF, BNP ~3900
   -SVO2>70
   -MAP>65 initially
   -CVP 8-12
   -f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   -surveillance blood cultures this AM
   -send sputum culture
   -follow up urine legionella antigen
   -wean levophed to maintain MAP>65
   -ruled out for MI
   -60Q 8 solumedrol for COPD flare
   .
   #  Altered mental status: Patient with dementia at baseline. Somnolent,
   unclear what patient's baseline is. Obtain ABG. LFTs and electrolytes
   unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal.
   -continue to assess
   -consider head CT
   -call family members in AM to discuss baseline.
   -treat infection
   .
   #  Microcytic Anemia: Baseline HCT 33-35. HCT on admission 28.8. Given
   hypotension, concern that blood loss may be contributing to
   hypotension. Ferritin of 69. Haptoglobin elevated, not consistent with
   hemolysis.
   -guaiac stools
   -follow [**Hospital1 **] HCT. Transfuse to keep HCT > 24
   .
   #  Acute renal failure: resolving. Baseline Cr 0.9-1.1. Cr on admission
   was 1.6. Down to 1.1 this AM. Likely prerenal in the setting of
   infection and sepsis.
   -continue IV fluids to maintain BP
   .
   #  Lactic acidosis: resolved. Lactate 2.5 in ED. Likely secondary to
   organ hypoperfusion. No abdominal pain. Repeat lactate 0.7 overnight.
   .
   #  Atrial fibrillation: Patient on digoxin, and anticoagulated on
   coumadin.
   -continue dig. Dig level in ED within normal limits
   -held coumadin overnight. INR 3.4 this AM. Consider restarting coumadin
   once INR< 3.0. Goal INR 2.0-3.0
   .
   # FEN: IVFs as needed for hypotension, replete electrolytes, NPO given
   concern for aspiration until speech and swallow evaluation or patients
   status improves. Aspiration precautions.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with hypotension and hypoxia. She presented with hypotension at a rehab facility and was found to have multi lumen central venous catheter placed in the emergency department. Blood cultures were obtained and the patient continues to require low-dose levophed. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and there is no information provided about the last dose of antibiotics given. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (range 72-88), blood pressure of 108/58 mmHg (range 70-123/43-65), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (range 19-26), and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm and central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg (range 6-12). Mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 98%. 

The patient has received a total of 1,160 mL of intravenous fluids since midnight and has lost 450 mL of fluids through urine output. The patient is on respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result pending. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination also not assessed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of sepsis, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing more respiratory distress with accessory muscle use, indicating possible worsening COPD, fluid overload, cardiac ischemia, or mucous plugging. The doctor plans to initiate a limited trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) and check for EKG changes and cardiac enzymes.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is presumed to be secondary to sepsis. The patient was able to wean off vasopressors, and empirical antibiotic coverage is pending culture data guidance.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had resolved acute renal failure and returned to baseline creatinine levels.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with medication.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is being treated with digoxin and therapeutic anticoagulation.

6. Other: The patient has an 18-gauge and multi-lumen line placed, prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia"

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, presumed secondary to an underlying cause such as fluid overload, worsening COPD, cardiac ischemia, or mucous plugging. The patient also has hypotension, presumed to be due to sepsis, and acute renal failure which has since resolved. Other diagnoses include hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/70 to 81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest with respiratory distress and prolonged expiration phase, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and muscle wasting. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 6.9 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) at 25.5%, elevated platelet count (Plt) at 155 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.1 mg/dL, and normal tro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and hypoxia. She has been experiencing episodes of chest pain, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The patient is on multiple medications including coumadin, digoxin, and solumedrol. Her blood cultures, urine culture, and urine legionella antigen have been sent. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and she requires respiratory support with BiPAP. Her labs show signs of infection and potential bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock from a pulmonary source: The patient's hypotension and hypoxia suggest a possible severe infection leading to septic shock. Immediate treatment is required to manage her condition and prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of wheezing, crackles, and the need for BiPAP indicate possible ARDS. Proper ventilation and oxygenation should be maintained to support her respiratory function.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, chest pain, and the presence of fever may suggest a respiratory infection such as pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, but close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary.

The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer. She was admitted to the ICU from another hospital due to low blood pressure (70/40 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 65 bpm). The patient is currently on digoxin.

During the 24-hour period, the patient received 40 mg IV lasix and was placed on BiPap. The patient had a negative fluid balance of 600 cc at 7 pm and was comfortable breathing. The younger brother of the patient provided an update.

BiPap was reduced to 50% at 7 pm, with a saturation level ranging from 99-100%. The patient reported intermittent dull chest pain over the past few months. An EKG showed no changes, and cardiac enzymes and troponins were sent for analysis. The pain subsided during the physical examination, and the patient was offered 1 mg of morphine if the pain recurs.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04/24/2118 at 05:45 pm. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given on 04/24/2118 at 08:26 am, heparin sodium for prophylaxis also given on 04/24/2118 at 08:26 am, and morphine sulfate administered on 04/25/2118 at 04:46 am.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 36.5°C, current temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/54 mmHg to 63/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on digoxin and has a sinus tachycardia rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 46.7 kg, with an admission weight of 40 kg.

The central venous pressure (CVP) is 2 mmHg, with a total input of 1,839 mL, including 70 mL of blood products. The patient has received 1,719 mL of intravenous fluids and has a total output of 2,533 mL, including 198 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 2,533 mL, with negative fluid balances of 694 mL and 128 mL for the NG and drains, respectively.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with BiPap, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, spontaneous Vt ranging from 220-694 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer. She was sent from Hospital 12 rehab due to low blood pressure (70/40) and a heart rate of 65. She is currently on digoxin. The patient received 40mg IV lasix in the morning and was placed on BiPap, with a net negative 600 cc at 7pm and comfortable breaths. Her oxygen saturation has been between 99-100%. The patient's brother reported that she experiences occasional lower sternal, mid chest chest pain that has been ongoing for months. An EKG was performed but showed no changes. Cardiac enzymes and troponin were sent, and the pain subsided during the physical exam. Morphine was recommended if the pain recurs.

Medications:
- Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) given on 04/24/2118 at 05:45 PM
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) given on 04/24/2118 at 08:26 AM

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] yo F with hypotension and hypoxia.
   #  Hypotension: BP at NH was 70/40. Despite IV fluids in ED, BP not
   responsive. Patient started on peripheral levophed in ED. Differential
   includes most likely septic shock from pulmonary source. Potential
   other etiologies that should always be considered are. Adrenal
   insufficiency, cardiogenic shock secondary to MI, PE to be considered.
   CXR shows infiltrate, concerning for pneumonia, along with SOB and
   cough. Started empirically on Vanc/Zosyn for pneumonia. Patient has
   ruled out for MI, cultures negative, and doesn't improve with abx,
   would consider CTA to rule out PE. AM cortisol within normal limits,
   making adrenal insufficiency less likely.
   -continue broad spectrum abx -Vanc and Zosyn
   -CVP 8-12
   -f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   -surveillance blood cultures this AM
   -send sputum culture
   -follow up urine legionella antigen
   -wean levophed to maintain MAP>65
   -ruled out for MI
   -60Q 8 solumedrol for COPD flare
   # Acute onset respiratory distress this AM: Patient sounds fluid
   overloaded, and received IV fluids overnight. Also has prolonged
   wheezing, concerning for COPD exacerbation. PE always a possibility. If
   doesn
t improve with diuresis, nebs, steroids, would consider CTA.
   -40mg IV lasix x1
   -monitor respiratory status thereafter
   -continue IV solumedrol, q3 hour albuterol, ipratropium
   -consider bipap as needed this AM
   -Continue Vanc/Zosyn empirically for pneumonia
   #  Altered mental status: Patient with dementia at baseline. Somnolent,
   unclear what patient's baseline is. Obtain ABG. LFTs and electrolytes
   unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal.
   -continue to assess
   -consider head CT
   -call family members in AM to discuss baseline.
   -treat infection
   #  Microcytic Anemia: Baseline HCT 33-35. HCT on admission 28.8. Given
   hypotension, concern that blood loss may be contributing to
   hypotension. Ferritin of 69. Haptoglobin elevated, not consistent with
   hemolysis.
   -guaiac stools
   -follow [**Hospital1 **] HCT. Transfuse to keep HCT > 24
   #  Acute renal failure: resolving. Baseline Cr 0.9-1.1. Cr on admission
   was 1.6. Down to 1.1 this AM. Likely prerenal in the setting of
   infection and sepsis.
   -continue IV fluids to maintain BP
   #  Lactic acidosis: resolved. Lactate 2.5 in ED. Likely secondary to
   organ hypoperfusion. No abdominal pain. Repeat lactate 0.7 overnight.
   #  Atrial fibrillation: Patient on digoxin, and anticoagulated on
   coumadin.
   -continue dig. Dig level in ED within normal limits
   -held coumadin overnight. INR 3.4 this AM. Consider restarting coumadin
   once INR< 3.0. Goal INR 2.0-3.0
   # FEN: IVFs as needed for hypotension, replete electrolytes, NPO given
   concern for aspiration until speech and swallow evaluation or patients
   status improves. Aspiration precautions.
   # Prophylaxis: anticoagulated on coumadin, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and hypoxia. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected septic shock from a pulmonary source. Fluid overload is also a concern in the setting of CHF and wheezing in the setting of COPD. Diuretics are being administered as needed, along with steroids and nebulizers for respiratory support. 

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to her pre-existing dementia. Microcytic anemia is present, with a baseline hematocrit (HCT) of 33-35 and current HCT of 26.8. This may indicate bleeding, and further investigation is warranted, including stool guaiac testing and follow-up with [**Hospital1**]. 

Atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with digoxin, and warfarin administration is temporarily withheld due to supratherapeutic INR levels. 

The patient is receiving IV fluids as needed for hypotension, repletion of electrolytes, and NPO status due to concerns for aspiration until a speech and swallow evaluation can be performed or the patient's status improves. Aspiration precautions are in place.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer. She was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation hospital for hypotension and hypoxia. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for a suspected pulmonary source of infection. However, the initial concern for a pulmonary infection cannot be reproduced on chest X-ray. 

She is experiencing acute respiratory distress due to dual etiologies, including CHF exacerbation and COPD exacerbation. The patient has been given intermittent furosemide boluses and methylprednisolone to manage her symptoms. 

Her nutrition has failed, and it is planned to insert a nasogastric tube when her international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2. 

The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and warfarin is being held. She has received IV vitamin K for reversal of the effects of warfarin. 

The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, which has resolved. She has a history of dementia at baseline. 

Additionally, she has microcytic anemia, with a hematocrit (HCT) level of 27 (baseline HCT 33-35). Monitoring of HCT and gu"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The note outlines her current condition, treatment plan, and potential medical complications.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock from a pulmonary source and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has acute respiratory distress, which has been resolved, and her fluid overload has been addressed. The patient's past medical history includes COPD, for which she is receiving steroids and nebulizers, and pneumonia, for which she is on antibiotics.

The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to her pre-existing dementia. She also has microcytic anemia, with a current HCT level of 26.8, indicating a concern for bleeding. The healthcare team is monitoring her guaiac stools and will follow up with a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for any bleeding. They are considering a transfusion to maintain a HCT level above 24 and may perform an endoscopy to investigate the cause of the anemia.

Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation, which has been rate-controlled. She is on digoxin and holding warfarin due to a high INR. The goal INR range is set between 2.0-3.0, and the team may consider a small dose of beta-blocker if the patient has a rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, meaning do not"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol for rate control, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and vancomycin among others. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 to 127/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 46.7 kg, with a CVP of 2 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 879 mL and output of 598 mL, resulting in a balance of 281 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool face tent, standby ventilator mode, and oxygen delivery of 70%. Physical examination reveals somnolence, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, diminished breath sounds with crackles at the bases, and sparse expiratory wheezes. Neurological examination shows left-sided facial droop, fragmented speech, and recall not intact. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, mildly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and acute respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and hypoxia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not fully ventilated. She has diminished breath sounds bilaterally, crackles at the bases, and sparse expiratory wheezes. The patient also has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm and a left-sided facial droop with fragmented speech. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal troponin-T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/SIRS: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension yesterday after diuresis, which could indicate sepsis-induced hypotension. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, suggesting a possible infection.
2. Acute respiratory distress: The patient has dual etiology for acute respiratory distress, likely due to CHF exacerbation and COPD exacerbation. This requires careful management with diuretics and corticosteroids.

","The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications including lasix, metoprolol, digoxin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 83 bpm with an irregularly irregular rhythm, blood pressure of 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 305 mL, PEEP of 2 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and an ABG result of ///34/. 

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with crackles at the bases and sparse expiratory wheezes. The patient has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm and is tachycardic. There are no murmurs heard. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Surgical scars are present. The extremities are warm, well perfused, with 2+ pulses. There is no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is 1+ non-pitting edema. Neurological examination shows left-sided facial droop, A+Ox1, fragmented speech, and recall not intact.
