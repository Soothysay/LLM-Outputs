","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient has a long-standing history of alcohol abuse, with no sobriety in the past two months. His last drink was approximately 36 hours prior to admission. He is at risk for withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens (DTs) due to concurrent hallucinations and confusion associated with withdrawal symptoms.

Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in electrolytes and fluids, which requires careful monitoring and management.
2. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient's history of alcohol abuse indicates impaired health maintenance, which needs to be addressed through counseling and support for alcohol abuse.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal/Agitation: The patient is at risk for withdrawal seizures and DTs, so close monitoring and medication management (such as Valium PO) is necessary.
4. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs are likely due to alcoholic liver disease, as indicated by the 2:1 AST:ALT ratio and increased alcohol intake. Other potential causes such as sarcoidosis, T-cell lymphoma, and hemochromatosis are less likely.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB)/Anemia: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding related to severe esophagitis. He is also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. He has been experiencing symptoms of withdrawal, including agitation and hallucinations. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is at risk for withdrawal seizures. He has an elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding. There are concerns about pancytopenia, which may be secondary to chronic liver disease or other underlying conditions. The patient's hypertension is multifactorial and related to withdrawal and known history of hypertension. The patient has chosen to be DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and DNI (Do Not Intubate), but has expressed a desire for temporary intubation and resuscitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Withdrawal seizures: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and current symptoms of withdrawal increase his risk for seizures.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to severe esophagitis and potential development of varices.
3. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests indicate possible liver failure, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 50 year old man with history of ETOH
   abuse admitted to ICU with alcohol withdrawal and elevated LFTs
   consistent with alcoholic liver disease.
   .
   #  ETOH withdrawal/agitation: Patient has longstanding history of
   alcohol abuse and has had prolonged period of heavy drinking with no
   sobriety last 2 months. Last drink was approximately 36 hours prior to
   admission but history unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1490**] use and current symptoms, he is at
   risk for withdrawak seizures and was in DTs given concurrent
   hallucinations and confusion associated with symptoms of withdrawal.
   - monitor on CIWA: valium PO then IV if necessary
   - thiamine [**Hospital1 7**], MIV, Folic Acid
   - restraints d/c
   - SW consult for alcohol abuse
   - ?CM for inpatient program
   - ?psych consult
   .
   #  Elevated LFTs: 2:1 AST:ALT ratio and increased alcohol intake make
   alcoholic liver disease most likely etiology. Discriminant function
   19-30 based on range of lab's control. Since <32, no indication for
   steroids. Also has history of sarcoidosis and T cell lymphoma and ?
   hemochromatosis, but I think these are less likely etiologies of his
   acute presentation given correlation with increased ETOH intake per
   reprot. Tylenol level negative and no recent use per report. Bili also
   elevated but no e/o cholecystitis.
   -LFTs trending down [**6-21**]; pending this am
   - hepatitis ABC negative, iron NL and ferritin/TIBC not elevated to
   suggest hemochromatosis
   - appreciate liver recommendations and consult; await final endoscopy
   report

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient has been experiencing symptoms of withdrawal, including agitation and hallucinations, indicating a risk for withdrawal seizures. He is currently being monitored on the CIWA scale and receiving Valium PO, with the possibility of IV administration if necessary. Thiamine, MIV, folic acid, restraints, social work consultation for alcohol abuse, consideration for a chemical dependency program, and a psychiatric consultation have been recommended.

The patient's elevated liver function tests are likely due to alcoholic liver disease, given the 2:1 AST:ALT ratio and increased alcohol intake. A discriminant function of 19-30 has been calculated, which is below the threshold of 32 that would indicate the need for steroids. Other potential causes of the elevated liver function tests, such as sarcoidosis, T-cell lymphoma, and hemochromatosis, have been considered but are less likely given the correlation with increased alcohol intake. Tylenol level was negative, and there is no recent use reported. The patient's bilirubin level is also elevated, but there are no signs of cholecystitis. The final endoscopy report and liver recommendations are pending.

The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) related to severe esophagitis in 1998 but no previous history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) consistent with alcoholic liver disease.
- The patient's last drink was approximately 36 hours prior to admission, indicating ongoing withdrawal symptoms.
- The patient has been experiencing agitation and confusion, which are symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. He is at risk for withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens (DTs).
- The patient's LFTs show a 2:1 AST:ALT ratio, suggesting alcoholic liver disease as the most likely etiology.
- The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, T-cell lymphoma, and possible hemochromatosis, but these conditions are less likely to be the cause of his acute presentation.
- The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is related to severe esophagitis, and he is at risk for further bleeding or Mallory-Weiss tear.
- The patient's pancytopenia is likely secondary to chronic liver disease, but other etiologies may need to be ruled out, especially considering his history of T-cell lymphoma.
- The patient's hypertension is multifactorial, related to withdrawal and a known history of hypertension with recent medication noncompliance.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and has been placed on a regular diet.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient has a longstanding history of alcohol abuse and has not been sober for the past two months. The last drink was approximately 36 hours prior to admission.

The patient is at risk for withdrawal seizures and is currently experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including agitation and hallucinations. The patient has already received 45mg of Valium in the emergency department.

The patient's elevated liver function tests, including a 2:1 AST:ALT ratio, are likely due to alcoholic liver disease. The discriminant function is 19-30, indicating that steroids are not indicated. Other possible etiologies, such as sarcoidosis, T-cell lymphoma, and hemochromatosis, are less likely given the correlation with increased alcohol intake.

The patient also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) related to severe esophagitis in 1998, but no previous history of varices. The patient is at risk for further bleeding and may have developed varices due to severe portal gastropathy on a previous esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient's pancytopenia is likely secondary to chronic liver disease. The patient's hypertension is multifactorial and related to withdrawal and a known history of hypertension with recent medication noncompliance.

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient is at risk for withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens due to heavy alcohol intake and lack of sobriety. He has received Valium for agitation and is being monitored on the CIWA scale. Thiamine, multivitamins, and folic acid have been administered. The patient has elevated liver enzymes with a 2:1 AST:ALT ratio, which suggests alcoholic liver disease. His discriminant function value is between 19-30, indicating that steroids are not necessary. The patient also has a history of sarcoidosis and T-cell lymphoma, but these are less likely etiologies of his acute presentation. He has a negative Tylenol level and no recent use reported. Biliary elevation is noted, but no evidence of cholecystitis is observed. Hepatic serologies and iron studies are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 153/65 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been receiving IV Valium for agitation and is currently calm. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there are concerns about potential varices or tears. The patient's pancytopenia may be secondary to chronic liver disease, and further investigations are needed to rule out other etiologies. The patient's hypertension is multifactorial and related to withdrawal and a history of hypertension. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is at risk for withdrawal seizures due to his prolonged period of heavy drinking and lack of sobriety. Close monitoring and administration of IV Valium are recommended.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) related to severe esophagitis, and there is a concern for the development of varices or tears given his recent vomiting and severe portal gastropathy. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of endoscopy are recommended"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly low heart rate and normal blood pressure. He is receiving diazepam for agitation and haloperidol for insomnia. The patient's blood work shows normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated liver enzymes. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient has been diagnosed with electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired health maintenance, alcohol abuse, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment plans include managing alcohol withdrawal, addressing elevated liver enzymes, investigating pancytopenia, monitoring gastrointestinal bleeding, managing hypertension, and ensuring proper communication. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient is currently receiving benzodiazepines for agitation, but there is a risk of worsening withdrawal symptoms if the medication is not adjusted properly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic liver disease, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion and altered mental status.
3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppression due to liver disease increase the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and elevated liver function tests consistent with alcoholic liver disease. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note.

Based on the information provided, the patient has been experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in electrolytes, specifically sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-). The levels of these electrolytes are abnormal, indicating a possible fluid and electrolyte disorder.

2. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient's history of alcohol abuse suggests that he may have impaired health maintenance due to chronic alcohol use.

3. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which is a contributing factor to his current condition.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) related to severe esophagitis. The recent endoscopy (EGD) showed esophagitis, which could indicate a risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This could be secondary to chronic liver disease and alcoholism.

6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is likely multifactorial and related"
