121844.0,224511,2123-05-23 05:26:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"According to the patient
s cousin, he requested that she be called from
   the ED prior to be intubated (a message was left on her machine). When
   she retrieved the message, she called the ICU to ask about his
   situation. When enough identifying characteristics were present
   (town/state of home address, general appearance, basic medical
   history), she was invited in to see the patient.
   Per my discussion with his cousin [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 343**] [**Name (NI) 4793**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9140**],
   home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9141**]), Mr. [**Known lastname 9142**] (or she says his real last name is
[**Name (NI) 9139**]
) comes from a family with lots of psychiatric illness. His
   living situation is unknown. His wife lives in a psychiatric facility,
   and the cousin has never met her. They are not close, although she says
   she last saw him in the fall and he called her as recently as two weeks
   ago.
   She is not comfortable making his healthcare decisions, and he is
   intubated and sedated. According to Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 4793**], there are no other
   family members available to be his healthcare proxy; he does have four
   brothers, one of whom ([**Name (NI) 424**]) might be appropriate, but it is not
   clear how close Mr. [**Known lastname 9142**] and his brother [**Name (NI) 424**] are.
   As it stands, we will continue medical intensive care as we see
   appropriate. We do not have consent for procedures, intubation, or
   sedation at this time, but given his tenuous respiratory status, it is
   appropriate to continue. This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1165**], ICU
   attending.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's cousin, Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 4793**], was contacted prior to intubation and informed about the patient's condition. The patient has a family history of psychiatric illness, and his living situation is unknown. His wife is currently in a psychiatric facility, and the cousin has never met her. Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 4793**] mentioned that she is not comfortable making healthcare decisions for the patient. It is unclear if there are any other available family members to act as the healthcare proxy. The patient's brother, [**Name (NI) 424**], might be an appropriate choice, but their relationship is not clear. Without consent, the medical team will continue with medical intensive care as they deem appropriate. This decision was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1165**], the ICU attending physician.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include respiratory distress due to the tenuous respiratory status, the lack of consent for procedures such as intubation and sedation, the unknown living situation, and the limited availability of family members to make healthcare decisions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 48 yo male with ? COPD/Asthma, ? CAD (medical history remains
   unclear) with a history of previous intubation admitted from the ED for
   respiratory distress from either COPD or CHF.
   #. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection
   and found to have RUL collapse/aspiration on CXR that has now cleared.
   By record review, the patient has a baseline pulmonary process, unclear
   if it is COPD or Asthma and has required intubation in the past.
   Initial work-up including bronchoscopy and BAL unrevealing for any
   clear infectious etiology or mucous plug.  Further complicating the
   clinical picture is the patient
s high requirement and relative
   ineffectiveness of Fentanyl/Midazolam as sedative agents.
   - F/U BAL Cx
   - D/C levo/flagyl, continue CTX to cover for aspiration PNA
   - MDIs, Prednisone 60mg Daily x5 days
   - Currently on AC, attempt pressure support trial to transition to
   extubation
   - Change sedation to Propofol as patient should not have tolerance
   # . Hypotension: The patient has had hypotension overnight requiring
   decreasing amounts of norepinephrine. Given his clinical picture, the
   differential includes intubation medication reaction, cardiogenic
   shock, sepsis from PNA, auto-PEEP from high airways resistance.
   Currently he is requiring minimal pressor support, appears euvolemic
   and his airways resistance has decreased.
   -          F/U cultures and continue CTX for now as above.
   -          Wean levophed as tolerated and maintain MAP>65
   -          Trend Cardiac Enzymes
   #. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient has developed bradycardia overnight
   that cannot be explained easily by medications other than levophed or
   possibly prednisone. No history of bradycardia, no evidence of cardiac
   insult, possibly infected but no evidence of lyme.
   - Trend Cardiac Enzymes
   - Wean levophed
   - Considering holding Prednisone
   - Close cardiac monitoring, atropine if patient becomes unstable

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old male with unclear medical history, possibly COPD/Asthma and CAD.
- He was admitted from the emergency department for respiratory distress, which could be due to COPD or congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient required intubation for airway protection and was found to have a right upper lobe (RUL) collapse/aspiration on chest X-ray, which has now cleared.
- Initial work-up, including bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), was unrevealing for any clear infectious etiology or mucous plug.
- The patient has a high requirement and relative ineffectiveness of Fentanyl/Midazolam as sedative agents.
- The patient's high blood pressure is being managed with decreasing amounts of norepinephrine.
- The patient developed bradycardia overnight that cannot be easily explained by medications other than levophed or possibly prednisone.
- No history of bradycardia, no evidence of cardiac insult, possibly infected but no evidence of Lyme disease.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are being trended.
- Levophed is being weaned as tolerated, and the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is being maintained above 65.
- Considering holding Prednisone.
- Close cardiac monitoring, atropine if the patient becomes unstable.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 48 yo male with an unclear medical history including COPD
   previously requiring intubation, alleged CAD s/p MI, and diastolic CHF
   presenting with chest pain and in respiratory distress with progressive
   opacification and volume loss of the right lung field.  Continues to be
   sedated but awake while intubated.
   #. COPD/ Respiratory Failure: Patient has baseline COPD, unclear if
   this episode is COPD or an additional process.  BALs have been
   inconclusive and viral screen needs to be resent. DDx: COPD, PNA,
   Aspiration, Mucous plugging.  Not effectively sedated on
   Fentanyl/Midazolam.
   - F/U BAL Cx
   - Empiric CTX, Levo, Flagyl
   - MDIs
   - methylprednisolone 60mg IV daily
   - given possibility of aspiration, pt at risk for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] aim for
   [**First Name3 (LF) **] net volumes.  Add propofol for further sedation.
   #. Chest Pain: Per OMR, history of CAD has not been confirmed. It seems
   that pt has claimed other diagnoses which he does not carry i.e.
   Multiple Scelrosis. Echo from last year showed no focal wall motion
   abnml suggestive of prior MI. Likewise, EKG shows no findings c/w
   ischemia or prior infarct.  First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - trend CE x3, serial EKG
   - s/p ASA 325 in ED
   - no BP room for BB currently
   # . Hypotension: Resolving but still on levophed dose of 0.03. Etiology
   includes sepsis/infection, drug effect from intubation, PEEP physiogy,
   hypovolemia. Per ED account may have been temporally related to
   initiation of sedation and intubation.
   -          F/U cultures and continue Abx for now as above.
   -          Wean levophed as tolerated and maintain MAP>65

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old male with unclear medical history, including COPD, previous intubation, alleged coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient presented with chest pain and respiratory distress, with progressive opacification and volume loss of the right lung field.
- The patient is currently sedated but awake while intubated.
- The patient has a history of COPD, but it is unclear if the current episode is due to COPD or another process.
- BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) results have been inconclusive, and a viral screen needs to be resent.
- Differential diagnoses include COPD, pneumonia (PNA), aspiration, and mucous plugging.
- The patient is not effectively sedated on Fentanyl/Midazolam.
- Empiric antibiotic therapy, MDIs (metered-dose inhalers), methylprednisolone, and propofol for further sedation have been ordered.
- The patient has a history of CAD, but confirmation of this diagnosis is uncertain. The patient has reported other diagnoses that he does not carry, such as multiple sclerosis. An echocardiogram from last year showed no focal wall motion abnormalities suggestive of prior MI, and an EKG showed no findings consistent with ischemia or prior infarct."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 48 yo male with ? COPD/Asthma, ? CAD (medical history remains
   unclear) with a history of previous intubation admitted from the ED for
   respiratory distress from either COPD or CHF.
   #. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection
   and found to have RUL collapse/aspiration on CXR that has now cleared.
   By record review, the patient has a baseline pulmonary process, unclear
   if it is COPD or Asthma and has required intubation in the past.
   Initial work-up including bronchoscopy and BAL unrevealing for any
   clear infectious etiology or mucous plug.  Further complicating the
   clinical picture is the patient
s high requirement and relative
   ineffectiveness of Fentanyl/Midazolam as sedative agents.
   - F/U BAL Cx
   - D/C levo/flagyl, continue CTX to cover for aspiration PNA
   - MDIs, Prednisone 60mg Daily x5 days
   - Currently on AC, attempt pressure support trial to transition to
   extubation
   - Change sedation to Propofol as patient should not have tolerance
   # . Hypotension: The patient has had hypotension overnight requiring
   decreasing amounts of norepinephrine. Given his clinical picture, the
   differential includes intubation medication reaction, cardiogenic
   shock, sepsis from PNA, auto-PEEP from high airways resistance.
   Currently he is requiring minimal pressor support, appears euvolemic
   and his airways resistance has decreased.
   -          F/U cultures and continue CTX for now as above.
   -          Wean levophed as tolerated and maintain MAP>65
   -          Trend Cardiac Enzymes
   #. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient has developed bradycardia overnight
   that cannot be explained easily by medications other than levophed or
   possibly prednisone. No history of bradycardia, no evidence of cardiac
   insult, possibly infected but no evidence of lyme.
   - Trend Cardiac Enzymes
   - Wean levophed
   - Considering holding Prednisone
   - Close cardiac monitoring, atropine if patient becomes unstable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with unclear medical history, admitted for respiratory distress. He has a history of COPD/Asthma and previous intubation. The patient was intubated due to airway protection and found to have right upper lobe collapse/aspiration on chest X-ray, which has now cleared. Initial work-up including bronchoscopy and BAL were unrevealing for any clear infectious etiology or mucous plug. The patient requires high amounts of sedation and has been unresponsive to Fentanyl/Midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to unclear COPD or Asthma exacerbation. Further complicating the clinical picture is the patient's high requirement and relative ineffectiveness of Fentanyl/Midazolam as sedative agents.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had hypotension overnight requiring decreasing amounts of norepinephrine. The differential includes intubation medication reaction, cardiogenic shock, sepsis from PNA, and auto-PEEP from high airways resistance.
3. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient has developed bradycardia overnight that cannot be explained easily by medications other than levophed or possibly prednisone. No history of bradycardia, no evidence of cardiac insult, possibly infected but no evidence of lyme."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a primary diagnosis of COPD/Asthma and possible peri-intubational asthma. He was intubated in the emergency department and remains intubated due to respiratory failure.

The patient has been experiencing bradycardia, high sedation requirements, and copious thin non-purulent secretions. His culture data remains negative, and his chest X-ray has cleared, as has his physical exam. The decision to continue with intubation has been made, focusing on secretion management, lightening of sedation, and another spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the primary reason for his continued intubation. If the secretions and difficulty with sedation worsen or if the patient does not improve during the SBT, there may be a need for more advanced respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's persistent bradycardia needs further evaluation and management. It is important to monitor the patient closely and consider adjusting sedation levels or using atropine if the bradycardia becomes unstable. Consulting cardiology may also provide valuable insights into the underlying cause of the bradycardia.

3. Infection: Although the patient's culture data remains negative, it is crucial to continue monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 48 yo male who was intubated in the ED and admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for ? COPD/Asthma and possible peri-intubational aspriation.  He
   continues to have bradycardia and high sedation requirements overnight
   resulting in hypotension as well as copious thin non-purulent
   secretions.
   #. Respiratory Failure: The patient self-extubated today during rounds
   and was placed on a non-rebreather.  His sedation will be weaned
   accordingly.  Now that we are able, we will obtain a more thorough
   history of his present illness to guide therapy towards either COPD or
   asthma.  We will also discuss PFTs if the patient will cooperate.  He
   has already expressed a desire to leave AMA but currently does not feel
   that he is breathing well enough to leave.  No evidence of aspiration
   PNA
   -          Restart Prednisone 30mg x 5 days, Start continue MDIs, Start
   Advair [**Hospital1 **]
   -          F/U Cultures
   -          D/C CTX (no evidence of PNA), 3 days of Azithro (5 days
   total of Abx)
   -          Follow closely for reintubation
   #. Transient  Hypotension: Likely due to sedation, now off sedation.
   #. Sinus Bradycardia: Minimal bradycardia after lightened sedation.
   Our current theories are vagal response to intubation, steroid effect
   or sedation effect.  As the patient is now not intubated or sedated,
   and the benefit of steroids likely outweighs the risk, we will continue
   to monitor.  Currently normal sinus rhythm.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected COPD/asthma and possible peri-intubational aspiration. He remains intubated due to respiratory failure, with ongoing difficulty managing sedation and copious secretions. Cultures and CXR results are negative, and physical exam findings have improved. The patient continues to experience transient hypotension likely secondary to sedation and sinus bradycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an ongoing inability to manage sedation and secretions effectively.
2. Transient Hypotension: The patient may experience further episodes of hypotension if sedation levels are not carefully monitored and adjusted.
3. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may persist or worsen if the underlying cause is not identified and appropriately managed.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm or rule out these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD and asthma, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and possible peri-intubation aspiration. He underwent an unplanned extubation and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen via a facemask. The patient is still requiring sedation, but has been restarted on prednisone. He is also receiving other medications including midazolam, furosemide, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to COPD and asthma exacerbation, as well as possible heart failure history. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjustment of treatment accordingly is necessary.
2. Reintubation: Due to the previous unplanned extubation, there is a risk of requiring reintubation if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
3. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, which requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to high sedation requirements and should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
5. Infection: The patient has received azithromycin for possible infection, and cultures are being followed up. Monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting treatment if necessary is important.
6. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. This should be closely monitored and managed to maintain adequate hydration"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This is a 48 yo male who was intubated in the ED and admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for ? COPD/Asthma and possible peri-intubational aspriation.  He
   is doing well post self-extubation requiring only nasal cannula.
   Bradycardia and hypotension resolved.
   #. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a reported COPD & Asthma as
   well as MI/Heart failure history.  Significant diuresis yesterday after
   40mg IV Lasix.  Continues to refuse oral and inhaled prednisone because
   of past psychosis.
   -          Start continue MDIs, Continue discussion re: Steroids and
   Advair [**Hospital1 **] with the patient
   -          F/U Cultures
   -          Continue Azithro x2 more days
   -          Echo to evaluate cardiac function

","The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and possible peri-intubation aspiration. He was intubated in the ED and has since self-extubated. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/45 mmHg to 135/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of COPD and asthma, as well as myocardial infarction and heart failure. He underwent significant diuresis yesterday after receiving 40mg IV Lasix. The patient refuses oral and inhaled prednisone due to past psychosis.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, and platelet count of 428 K/uL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 620 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 196 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, symmetric chest expansion, bronchial breath sounds with wheezes, and no evident skin lesions. The patient is lightly sedated and has a limited neurological exam due to agitation.

The patient's medical plan includes starting continuous MDIs, continuing discussion regarding steroids and Advair, following up with cultures, continuing azithromycin for two more days, obtaining an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function, and scheduling outpatient pulmonary follow-up with pulmonary function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of cardiac function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent these complications."
