   Patient had femoral line pulled around 1600 yesterday -> post-cath
   check showed no hematoma or bruits. Swan-Ganz was placed in cath lab
   under fluoro guidance after placement of the RIJ catheter sheath at
   bedside. A-line attempted last night in R radial artery but was
   unsuccessful. Has been hemodynamically stable overnight.
   Patient slept well last night, on CPAP. No dyspnea overnight, breathing
   comfortably except some chest pain with deep inspiration. C/o
   productive (yellowish sputum) cough with sore throat. Back/shoulder

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

   10:16 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of severe NYHA class IV systolic heart failure, an ejection fraction of 20%, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of heart failure and transferred to the critical care unit from another hospital for aggressive diuresis and possible renal replacement therapy for acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Severe systolic heart failure with low ejection fraction: The patient's heart is not pumping effectively, leading to fluid buildup and congestion in the body.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can be a result of poor renal perfusion due to severe systolic heart failure. This condition requires careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice. There is significant stenosis in the right coronary artery, but the grafts are patent.

4. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): The patient has an ICD implanted for rhythm management. It is programmed to fire for ventricular tachycardia (VT) >140 bpm and ventricular fibrillation (VF) >190 bpm.

5. Mitral valve replacement (MVR): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of severe NYHA class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. He presented to the hospital for an acute exacerbation of CHF and was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for aggressive diuresis and possible renal replacement therapy (RRT) due to acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He also has a bioprosthetic mitral valve, which is functioning well. The patient's current medications include metoprolol tartrate, atorvastatin, aspirin, and amiodarone. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of severe CHF, previous MI, and CAD, there is a high risk of recurrent cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary. There is a risk of worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction of 20%. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the critical care unit from another hospital for aggressive diuresis and possible renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction with CABG x2. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and is not a candidate for left ventricular pacing. The patient's current medications include lasix, milrinone, phenylephrine, metoprolol tartrate, atorvastatin, and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of CHF: The patient's symptoms and history suggest a worsening of his heart failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and oxygenation is crucial.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. Continued monitoring of renal parameters and ongoing management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances are necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's initial presentation included hyperkalemia, which has been treated. Close monitoring of"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sore throat. He was found to have signs and symptoms of uremia, indicating renal failure, and volume overload. The patient underwent replacement of his right internal jugular (IJ) peripheral arterial catheter with a hemodialysis (HD) tunneled line, as well as removal of the PA catheter. He was started on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVHDF) overnight, achieving the goal of removing 100 cc fluid per hour. The patient also received BiPAP support overnight per outpatient management, and an ultrasound of his left upper extremity is pending. No other significant events occurred overnight.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown heparin agents. His last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2179-9-3**]. The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including calcium gluconate (CRRT) at a rate of 1.4 grams per hour, potassium chloride (CRRT) at a rate of 2 mEq. per hour, and milrinone at 0.375 mcg per kilogram per minute. He is also on other ICU medications.

Review of systems reveals unchanged information from admission except for the sore throat. The patient's vital signs are as follows: maximum temperature (Tmax) of 36.6 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 91/61 mmHg to 152/94 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrioventricular paced, and his weight is currently 19.2 kilograms, with a reported admission weight of 116.8 kilograms. The patient's height is 69 inches.

His central venous pressure (CVP) is 25 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are 52/32 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 63%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,124 mL and output of 1,489 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 635 mL since midnight. His respiratory support includes CPAP mask with an SpO2 of 96% and an ABG readout of ///24/. 

During physical examination, the patient appears overweight and obese, with normocephalic head, posterior oropharynx showing erythema, and no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with a present heave, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination shows rhonchorous breath sounds primarily during expiration at the apices. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, obese abdomen. Extremities show right lower extremity edema at 1+ and left lower extremity edema at 1+, described as dusky appearing. Skin examination is not assessed, and neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, oriented, and responsive, with normal movement, tone, and strength.

Laboratory results include a creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 35.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 187 mg/dL, white blood"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic heart failure, an ejection fraction of 20%, and secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient was admitted on 08/31/2179 for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from Hospital1 service for aggressive diuresis and possible renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) in 2153, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) x 2, and cardiac catheterization showing a right-dominant system with 50% mid-right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis, patent saphenous vein graft (SVG)-D1 and SVG-OM3 grafts, known occluded native left circumflex (LCx) and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries. The patient also has a bioprosthetic mitral valve, which appears to be functioning well on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and has been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, with creatinine increasing from baseline 2.5 to 4.2. The patient's current medications include calcium"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient was admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) from another hospital service for aggressive diuresis and possible renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including severe systolic CHF, akinetic anterior, septal, and apical segments in the left ventricle (LV), severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), elevated right- and left-sided pressures, and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including milrinone to augment systolic function, metoprolol tartrate instead of Toprol XL 50 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg, aspirin 81 mg, amiodarone 200 mg daily, and warfarin.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 83/47 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 93%. The patient is receiving cardiac monitoring, continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVHDF), and is being closely monitored for fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and other parameters.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hypotension, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection), and thromboembolic events (such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).

It is important to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamics, renal function, electrolyte levels, and respiratory status. Regular assessments of the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results should be performed to detect any changes or complications promptly."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction of 20%. He has been admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) from another hospital service for aggressive diuresis and possible renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes severe systolic CHF, akinetic anterior, septal, and apical segments in the left ventricle (LV), severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), elevated right- and left-sided pressures, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), as well as a bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF, acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperkalemia, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection), and thromboembolic events (such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). The patient's history of HIT, poor renal perfusion, and the use of CVVHDF for renal failure management are important considerations as well.

   daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given
   chills/rigors, relative hypothermia; no white count
   -  will obtain blood culture from HD cath, if possible, after
   discussing with Renal service
   -  f/u other pending blood cultures
   .
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: bp running low and ultrafiltration
   has had to be curtailed; we will add phenylephrine to raise map and
   then restart aggressive volume removal by hd-uf;  the hd catheter site
   is red but not excessively tender and there is no evidence of abscess
   or any purulent exudate; will continue hd until at least tomorrow but I
   think he will require more than that
   Once hd is done, I will try bumetanide drip at 1 mg per hour with
   metolazone 5 mg po bid

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction of 20%. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from another hospital.
- The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) in 2015. His cardiac catheterization showed right-dominant coronary circulation with 50% mid-right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis, patent saphenous vein grafts (SVGs), and occluded native left circumflex (LCx) and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries.
- The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and is on amiodarone for rhythm control.
- He has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is currently on argatroban.
- The patient also has a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR) and is not currently on long-term anticoagulation.
- He has acute on chronic renal failure with a rising creatinine level from baseline 2.5 to 4.2. The etiology is likely poor renal perfusion due to severe systolic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic heart failure, ejection fraction of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted for acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from another hospital for aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and CABG x2. He also has a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, and a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient's current condition includes severe systolic CHF, akinetic anterior, septal, and apical segments in LV, severe TR, elevated right- and left-sided pressures, poor renal perfusion, and acute on chronic renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has erythema and mild tenderness at the tunneled cath site, along with chills/rigors. This raises concern for infection. Blood cultures from the HD and PICC line tips are pending.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Had rigors/chills yesterday. Continued erythema and mild tenderness at
   tunneled cath site. Line was left in because of absence of obvious
   signs of infection. Cultured cath tip, f/u blood and urine cx. Chest
   xray unchanged. CVVH filter changed and continued for fluid removal.
   CVVH filter occluded twice, total Is/Os over 24 hours about even.
   Phenylephrine gtt started to maintain MAP>60. Plan to start Bumex gtt
   and restart metolazone after CVVH.
   Denies fevers/chills/rigors since yesterday morning, CP, shortness of
   breath, noticeable pain at tunneled cath site. Somnolent secondary to
   little sleep overnight (CVVH filter was changed several times).

The patient is a 69-year-old overweight/obese male with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/71 mmHg to 124/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on CPAP. The patient denies fever/chills, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and reports positional discomfort for which he took Percocet once last night. He also complains of a sore throat and cough but slept well. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown heparin agents. He is receiving infusions of phenylephrine at 0.8 mcg/kg/min and milrinone at 0.375 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include ICU medications and other medications not specified. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. His current weight is 112.3 kg, and his height is 69 inches.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight variation in blood pressure. His heart rhythm is AV paced. The patient has received a total of 5,745 mL of fluids, with 4,965 mL given through IVF. Blood product transfusion has been given, resulting in a total output of 6,342 mL. Urine output is 120 mL, NG output is 100 mL, and stool output is also 100 mL. The patient has a negative fluid balance of 597 mL since midnight.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears well-nourished but is overweight/obese. His head, ears, nose, and throat examination reveals no abnormalities. His cardiovascular examination shows normal first and second heart sounds, no murmurs, and right ventricular heave. Peripheral pulses are diminished in both right and left distal extremities. Respiratory examination is clear bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Extremities show no edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Lab Results:
The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. Creatinine levels are within normal limits. Glucose levels vary throughout the day but are mostly elevated. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, differential, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and lactic acid are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple problems including chronic renal failure, pain control, and chronic diastolic heart failure. The ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer,"

   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg).
   - Will continue CVVH for fluid removal today
   - Plan to start Bumex gtt and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] when finished with
   CVVH, possibly tomorrow
   - Continue milrinone gtt to augment systolic function
   - Keep maintaining MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt
   - Will not intiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI in [**2153**], CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed
   right-dominant system w/ 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and
   SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. No PCI undertaken.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg
   - Continue Toprol XL 50 mg daily

   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   - Monitor for recurrence of NSVT
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given
   chills/rigors, relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up
   -  f/u pending blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips
   - will continue to trend WBC
   .
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets continue to be stable (today 165). Will continue to follow
   daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - No need for Argatroban per heme/onc
   - LUE U/S negative for any clot
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   The goal weight for [**Doctor First Name 2897**] is 100 kg: this is his best dry weight.
   Today he is [**Age over 90 **].9 kg after 6 liters of volume removal.  I plan to
   continue cvvhd until current filter clogs, and then to switch to Bumex
   drip.  Will continue milrinone.
   Plan is for home milrinone infusion.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF, an ejection fraction of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted on [**2179-8-31**] for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has a history of CAD with previous MI and CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed right-dominant system with 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. He is currently on ASA 81 mg, Atorvastatin 20 mg, and Toprol XL 50 mg daily.

The patient also has a history of MVR with bioprosthetic mitral valve functioning well on TTE. He was on warfarin x 2 yrs before discharge by cardiologist, and there is a question about long-term anticoagulation upon discharge, which the patient declined in the past per Dr. [**First Name (STitle)**].

The patient's current medications include Percocet q6h prn for pain management, home amiodarone 200 mg daily, and lozenges for symptom relief of URI. He is also on a home insulin regimen for DM, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and CPAP at night for OSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline 2.5 to 4.2 and are now back around baseline. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and FeNa<1%. CVVHDF is planned today with a goal of 100 cc/hr, and the patient will be monitored for UOP.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (101/71 mmHg), indicating a risk of hypotension. The plan is to maintain MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has a high fluid balance with a total input of 5,745 mL and a total output of 6,342 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -597 mL. This indicates ongoing fluid overload, which needs to be addressed through aggressive diuresis and RRT.
4. Infection: There is concern for infection due to chills/rigors, relative hypothermia, and a trending up WBC count. Blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips are pending.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of NSVT and is on a DDI pacer with rate > 90 bpm,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Plan per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] is to continue CVVH until filter clogs. At that
   point start Bumex gtt, 1 mg bolus, then 1 mg/hour continuously. We will
   evaluate Pt in the AM. If anuric/oliguric, will discuss permanent HD
   placement and 3X weekly HD. At 5pm CVVH filter appears to be clogging,
   orders for diuresis entered.  At 9pm Pt anuric.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted on [**2179-8-31**] for acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) from Hospital1 service for aggressive diuresis and renal replacement therapy (RRT) for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/45 mmHg to 137/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on supplemental oxygen. He is mechanically ventilated.

Physical examination reveals clear lungs bilaterally, with no crackles or wheezes. His abdomen is soft, obese, and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. There is no peripheral edema or jugular venous distension noted. The patient's right radial pulse is not assessed, and his left radial pulse is weak and thready. His right dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse is not assessed, and his left DP pulse is weak and thready.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.7%, platelet count of 153 K/uL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 128 mg/dL to 232 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, phosphate of 2.3 mg/dL, calcium of 8.9 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.4 mmol/L. The patient's prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are within normal range.

The patient's medical history is significant for severe systolic CHF, akinetic anterior, septal, and apical segments in the left ventricle (LV), severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x 2, right-dominant circulation with 50% mid-right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis, patent saphenous vein grafts (SVG) to the distal 1st and omohyoid branches, known occluded native left circumflex artery (LCx) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), and a bioprosthetic mitral valve functioning well on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient's current plan includes continuing bumetanide and metolazone for diuresis, milrinone to augment systolic function, phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg, and monitoring input/output (I/O) and daily weights. Long-term hemodialysis (HD) is being considered if the patient remains anuric or oliguric.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening heart failure, development of infections (especially considering the concern for tunnelled HD line infection), and potential bleeding events due to anticoagulation therapy."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, and acute pain. He was admitted to the ICU due to worsening condition and required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) because of anuria. The plan is to continue CVVH until the filter clogs, then start Bumex diuresis. If the patient remains anuric or oliguric, permanent hemodialysis placement and three times weekly hemodialysis will be discussed.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Filter clogging during CVVH: This can lead to inadequate fluid removal and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Anuria or oliguria: The patient's lack of urine output indicates impaired kidney function, which may worsen renal failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, indicating potential hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation level is below normal, suggesting possible respiratory distress. This could be due to underlying lung conditions or fluid overload.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, but there is a negative fluid balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Monitoring fluid status closely is essential to prevent both overhydration and dehydration.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted on [2179-8-31] for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from [Hospital1 2259] service for aggressive diuresis and renal replacement therapy (RRT) for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C, heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 83/45 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 89%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. 

On physical examination, the patient has jugular venous distension (JVD), crackles in the lungs, and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 30 mmHg, indicating high left-sided filling pressures. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is on multiple medications including beta-blockers, statins, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulants.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and blood glucose levels. His white blood cell"

   secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted [**2179-8-31**] for acute
   exacerbation of CHF and transferred to CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for
   aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg).
   - Will continue Bumex gtt and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue milrinone gtt to augment systolic function
   - Keep maintaining MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt
   - Will not intiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI in [**2153**], CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed
   right-dominant system w/ 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and
   SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. No PCI undertaken.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg
   - Continue Toprol XL 50 mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given chills/rigors
   on [**9-5**], relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up
   -  f/u pending blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips
   - will continue to trend WBC (increasing progressively from [**9-5**] to
   today at 16.1), no left shift
   .
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets trending down but stable (today 153). Will continue to
   follow daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - No need for Argatroban per heme/onc
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increased from baseline 2.5 to
   4.2, now back around baseline. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion
   given severe systolic CHF and FeNa<1%
   - Currently oliguric, continue to monitor UOP
   - If continues to be anuric or oliguric, will consider long-term HD
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 4.9)
   - Does not need PhosLo at this point
   # URI: Cough and sore throat improved
   - continue guaifenisin and lozenges for symptom relief

","Based on the provided progress note, it appears to be a medical document detailing the health progress of a patient in the ICU. Unfortunately, the text is not easily readable due to various formatting issues, unnecessary characters, and lack of clear structure. As a result, it is difficult to extract specific information or identify potential medical complications from the given note.

To accurately analyze the progress note and determine potential medical complications, a thorough review and cleaning of the document are necessary. This would involve removing unnecessary characters, reorganizing the text into a coherent format, and ensuring proper grammar and spelling. Additionally, specific medical terminology and codes may need to be decoded or cross-referenced for accurate assessment.

Without a clean and organized version of the progress note, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive summary or identify potential medical complications. It is recommended to obtain a revised and legible version of the note for further analysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF with EF of 20%,
   secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted [**2179-8-31**] for acute
   exacerbation of CHF and transferred to CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for
   aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg). Aggressive
   diuresis with Bumex and metolazone has been ineffective.
   - Will likely need HD today for fluid removal since patient is
   hypervolemic and anuric
   - Continue milrinone gtt to augment systolic function
   - Keep maintaining MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt
   - Will not intiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights (dry weight is 100 kg)
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI in [**2153**], CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed
   right-dominant system w/ 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and
   SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. No PCI undertaken.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg
   - Continue Toprol XL 50 mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given chills/rigors
   on [**9-5**], relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up
   -  f/u pending blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips
   - will continue to trend WBC (increasing progressively from [**9-5**] to
   today at 16.4), no left shift
   .
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets trending down but stable (today 153). Will continue to
   follow daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - No need for Argatroban per heme/onc
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increased from baseline 2.5 to
   4.0. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and
   FeNa<1%. Anuric today
   - Continue to monitor UOP (anuric)
   - Will likely need HD today
 consult Nephrology
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 4.6)
   - Does not need PhosLo at this point
   # URI: Cough and sore throat improved
   - continue guaifenisin and lozenges for symptom relief
   .
   # DM: IDDM with recent HA1c in [**2179-7-30**] of 9.2%
   - Continue home insulin regimen
   - SSI for meal coverage
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - Continue home levothyroxine
   .
   # OSA
   - Continue CPAP at night
   .
   FEN:
   - Will replete potassium as needed to goal of [**4-27**].5
   - Fluid restriction of 1200 mL/day
   - Low-sodium (<2g/day), cardiac-prudent, diabetic diet
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, PICC, RIJ tunneled catheter
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SCD's
   - Incentive spirometer at bedside

   exacerbation of CHF and transferred to CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for
   aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg). Aggressive
   diuresis with Bumex and metolazone has been ineffective.

   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given chills/rigors
   on [**9-5**], relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up
   -  f/u pending blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips
   - will continue to trend WBC (increasing progressively from [**9-5**] to
   today at 16.4), no left shift
   .
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets trending down but stable (today 153). Will continue to
   follow daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - No need for Argatroban per heme/onc
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increased from baseline 2.5 to
   4.0. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and
   FeNa<1%. Anuric today
   - Continue to monitor UOP (anuric)
   - Will likely need HD today
 consult Nephrology
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 4.6)

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Patient doing poorly; requiring dialysis; remains hypotensive and
   anuric.
   Will add dobutamine to milrinone and restart bumetanide drip.  Will
   insert Impella device tomorrow and if his renal function improves, the
   goal will now be to get him to a point at which destination VAD may be
   considered.  Discussed at length with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 391**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10273**] at [**Hospital 1**] Medical
   Center.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF and an ejection fraction of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from Hospital1 service for aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Severe systolic CHF with LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior, septal, and apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left-sided pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg). Aggressive diuresis with Bumex and metolazone has been ineffective.
- Hypervolemic and anuric.
- Continue milrinone gtt to augment systolic function.
- Keep maintaining MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt.
- Will not initiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure.
- Monitor I/O, daily weights (dry weight is 100 kg).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's severe systolic CHF and elevated pressures indicate poor cardiac function. Aggressive diuresis has been ineffective so far, which suggests that the patient may continue to experience worsening heart failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's anuria"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF with EF of 20%,
   secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted [**2179-8-31**] for acute
   exacerbation of CHF and transferred to CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for
   aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg). Aggressive
   diuresis with Bumex and metolazone has been ineffective.
   - Will likely need HD today for fluid removal since patient is
   hypervolemic and anuric
   - Continue milrinone gtt to augment systolic function
   - Keep maintaining MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt
   - Will not intiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights (dry weight is 100 kg)
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI in [**2153**], CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed
   right-dominant system w/ 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and
   SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. No PCI undertaken.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg
   - Continue Toprol XL 50 mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given chills/rigors
   on [**9-5**], relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up
   -  f/u pending blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips
   - will continue to trend WBC (increasing progressively from [**9-5**] to
   today at 16.4), no left shift
   .
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets trending down but stable (today 153). Will continue to
   follow daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - No need for Argatroban per heme/onc
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increased from baseline 2.5 to
   4.0. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and
   FeNa<1%. Anuric today
   - Continue to monitor UOP (anuric)
   - Will likely need HD today
 consult Nephrology
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 4.6)
   - Does not need PhosLo at this point
   # URI: Cough and sore throat improved
   - continue guaifenisin and lozenges for symptom relief

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
- The patient was admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from another hospital for aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure.
- The patient is currently somnolent, possibly secondary to morphine received for odynophagia and positional pain.
- The patient reports difficulty breathing but somewhat relieved by sitting up in a chair. There are no signs of fever or chills.
- The patient has a history of CAD with previous MI and CABG x 2, and is on cardiac medications including ASA, Atorvastatin, and Toprol XL.
- The patient also has a history of ICD implantation and is on amiodarone for rhythm control.
- The patient has a history of HIT and is being monitored for platelet trends after heparin exposure.
- The patient has a history of MVR with functioning bioprosthetic mitral valve.
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with an increase in creatinine from baseline 2.5 to 4.0, likely due to poor renal perfusion.
- The patient is anuric today and will likely need HD today.
- Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted on [date] for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) from another hospital for aggressive diuresis and renal replacement therapy (RRT) due to fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz), and initiation of inotropes (dobutamine and milrinone) to augment cardiac output. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient's rhythm is currently set to bipacemaker-implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (BiV-ICD), which is programmed to fire for ventricular tachycardia (VT) >140 bpm and ventricular fibrillation (VF) >190 bpm.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophil predominance, increasing progressively from [date] to today at 16.4. There is a concern for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF and an ejection fraction of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted for acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from Hospital1 service for aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's condition remains unstable despite aggressive diuretic therapy with Bumex and metolazone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with neutrophil predominance, and there have been chills/rigors on 9/5, which may indicate an infection. Cultures have been repeated to identify the cause.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with an increase in creatinine from baseline. This could be due to poor renal perfusion caused by severe systolic CHF. Anuria was noted today.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of NSVT and is on an ICD for VT/VF. He will be monitored for arrhythmias, especially with concurrent milrinone and dobutamine use.
4. HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia): The patient has a history of HIT, and his platelet count is trending down. He will continue to be monitored for 4-10 days post-heparin exposure.
5. Mitral Valve Function: The patient underwent MVR and his bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on TTE. Long-term anticoagulation may be necessary upon discharge, but the patient declined.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient is oliguric and has fluid overload, as indicated by his elevated weight and fluid balance.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and is on home levothyroxine.
8. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has IDDM with a recent HbA1c of 9.2%. He is on home insulin regimen.
9. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient has OSA and is on CPAP at night.
10. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is low, and he will need repletion.
11. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia.
12. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been high, indicating hyperglycemia.
13. Throat Pain and Labored Breathing: The patient continues to experience throat pain and labored breathing, which may indicate respiratory issues.
14. Tremors: The patient has been experiencing tremors in his hands, which could be a sign of electrolyte imbalance or medication side effects.
15. Anxiety: The patient is anxious about the upcoming procedure today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 20%, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted on [**2179-8-31**] for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has been on dobutamine, bumex, and metolazone infusions, but has not responded well to the diuretics. He is hypervolemic and anuric, indicating poor renal perfusion. His blood pressure remains low, and he requires phenylephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with an increasing trend over the past few days, and there is concern for infection, especially considering the recent chills and rigors experienced during hemodialysis. Blood cultures have been obtained from the hemodialysis catheter tip and the PICC line.

The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is being monitored for platelet count trends. He also has a history of HIT with a previous Swan-Ganz catheter.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine from baseline"

   - Continue Toprol XL 50 mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor, will monitor for arrhythmia [**1-25**] concurrent
   milrinone and dobutamine
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given chills/rigors
   on [**9-5**], relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up with neutrophil
   predominance, no bands. Cultures (blood from cath tips, sputum)
   repeated [**9-9**].

   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets trending down but stable (today 153). Will continue to
   follow daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - If LVAD placed, will bridge with Argatroban to coumadin
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.

   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increased from baseline 2.5.
   Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and
   FeNa<1%. Anuric today
   - Continue to monitor UOP, oliguric currently
   - Continue to trend renal function after Impella to assess for
   end-organ perfusion
   - Ultrafiltration as necessary for fluid removal.
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 4.6)
   - Does not need PhosLo at this point

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe NYHA class IV systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 20%. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of heart failure and transferred to the CCU from another hospital service for aggressive diuretics and renal replacement therapy due to fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). His cardiac catheterization showed a right-dominant coronary circulation with 50% mid-right coronary artery stenosis, patent saphenous vein grafts, and known occluded native left circumflex and left anterior descending arteries. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, dobutamine, milrinone, and amiodarone.

The patient's recent white blood cell count has been trending up with neutrophil predominance, and cultures have been repeated. There is concern for a tunnelled HD line infection due to chills and rigors on September 5th. The patient's platelets have been decreasing but are currently stable.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is oliguric with anuria today. His serum creatinine has increased from baseline, and he is receiving ultrafiltr"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: despite extensive efforts at
   coordinating, troubleshooting, and adjusting Impella, his cardiac
   output has remaineed suboptimal and he remains anuric
   He now has jaundice indicating onset of hepatic failure; he now has
   cardiac failure, renal failure, and hepatic failure, making his
   recovery all but impossible
   I have now discussed with family and patienjt and he will now be
   DNR/CMO
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of severe NYHA class IV systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU from the Hospital1 service for aggressive diuresis and renal replacement therapy (RRT) for fluid removal and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has undergone several interventions, including Impella left ventricular assist device placement, Swan-Ganz catheter insertion, and initiation of milrinone and dobutamine infusions to augment systolic function. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is currently on cardiac monitoring and being treated for possible infection in the tunnelled HD line, as well as other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's history of severe systolic CHF with an EF of 20% puts him at high risk for further exacerbations of heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid status and hemodynamics is essential to prevent worsening of his cardiac function.
2. Infection: The patient has a concern for infection in the tunnelled HD line, evidenced by ch"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   68 yo M with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF with EF of 20%,
   secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted [**2179-8-31**] for acute
   exacerbation of CHF and transferred to CCU from [**Hospital1 2259**] service for
   aggressive diuresis and RRT for fluid removal and acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg). Aggressive
   diuresis with Bumex and metolazone has been ineffective.
   - Impella left ventricular assist device placed in cath lab with plan
   for destination LVAD if CO and renal perfusion improved
   - Continue milrinone gtt and dobutamine gtt to augment systolic
   function
   - impella trail for 72 hours, ending Monday afternoon, [**2179-9-13**]
   - Keep maintaining MAP > 60 with phenylephrine gtt
   - Will not intiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights (dry weight is 100 kg)
   - will ultrafiltrate if pt becomes hypoxic
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to review TTE, ? left atrial thrombus
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI in [**2153**], CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed
   right-dominant system w/ 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and
   SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. No PCI undertaken.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg
   - Continue Toprol XL 50 mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2179-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor, will monitor for arrhythmia [**1-25**] concurrent
   milrinone and dobutamine
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   # Tender tunnelled HD line
 concern for infection, given chills/rigors
   on [**9-5**], relative hypothermia; [**Name2 (NI) **] count trending up with neutrophil
   predominance, no bands. Cultures (blood from cath tips, sputum)
   repeated [**9-9**].
   -  f/u pending blood cultures from HD and PICC line tips
   - will continue to trend WBC (increasing progressively from [**9-5**] to
   today at 21.9), left shift, no bands
   - no antibiotics for now to prevent further renal impairment.
   # h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   - Platelets trending down but stable (today 153). Will contnue to
   follow daily for 4-10 days p heparin exposure.
   - If LVAD placed, will bridge with Argatroban to coumadin
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increased from baseline 2.5 to
   4.0. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and
   FeNa<1%. Anuric today
   - Continue to monitor UOP, oliguric currently
   - Continue to trend renal function after Impella to assess for
   end-organ perfusion
   - Ultrafiltration as necessary for fluid removal.
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 4.6)
   - Does not need PhosLo at this point
   .
   # URI: Cough and sore throat improved
   - continue guaifenisin and lozenges for symptom relief
   - consider Tessalon Pearls for improved symptom relief
   .
   # DM: IDDM with recent HA1c in [**2179-7-30**] of 9.2%
   - Continue home insulin regimen
   - SSI for meal coverage
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - Continue home levothyroxine
   .
   # OSA
   - Continue CPAP at night
   .
   FEN:
   - Will replete potassium as needed to goal of [**4-27**].5
   - Fluid restriction of 1200 mL/day
   - Low-sodium (<2g/day), cardiac-prudent, diabetic diet
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, PICC, RIJ tunneled catheter
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SCD's
   - Incentive spirometer at bedside
   -Pain management with Percocet q6h prn, PRN morphine for breakthrough

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 20%. He was admitted for an acute exacerbation of heart failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction and CABG surgery, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 100/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia. The patient has an elevated BUN and creatinine level indicative of renal dysfunction. Other lab values include elevated potassium levels and decreased calcium and magnesium levels.

The patient is on multiple medications including diuretics, vasopressors, inotropic agents, and anticoagulants. He has an Impella left ventricular assist device placed in the cath lab, and there is a plan for destination LVAD placement if the patient's cardiac output and renal perfusion improve. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated at 18 mmHg.
