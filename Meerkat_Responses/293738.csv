   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites and portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be
   apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and
   transferred to the MICU.
   .
   # Resp. failure:  Most likely etiology is aspiration event and
   subsequent respiratory arrest given patient was found in vomitus and
   gastric contents suctioned post-extubation.  CXR shows worsening
   bilateral infiltrates at bases consistent with this.  Was already being
   treated for possible asp. PNA with vanc/unasyn x 10 days, day 1 [**5-18**].
   Unfortunately ABG was unable to be obtained during code so unclear how
   hypoxic patient was, however oxygenating well currently.
   - Continue vanc, broadening to Zosyn for expanded GN coverage
   - Repeat sputum
   - Change to dexmedetomidine for sedation
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Daily wake-up, RSBI
   .
   # Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 60**] in part relate to sedatives. Sepsis also clearly a concern.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Changing to dexmedetomidine
   - CVL to better measure CVP
   - Cont. pressors
   .
   # ARF:
   DDx includes pre-renal from overdiuresis, ATN from hypotension. Given
   cirrhosis must also consider hepatorenal syndrome or abdominal
   compartment syndrome.
   - Hold diuretics
   - Check bladder pressure
   - Check urine lytes
   - Follow Cr/urine output
   - Talk with renal re ?midodrine and octreotide
   #. Ileus: Diagnosed on CT.  Decompressed with NGT and had resolved on
   recent KUB which was negative for obstruction.  Abdomen mote tense and
   tympanic today concerning for obstruction. [**Month (only) 60**] have been inciting event
   for aspiration on the floor.
   - surgery following, appreciate their input
   - OG tube to low wall suction
   - NPO
   - KUB now
   # EtoH Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices with
   recent UGIB.  LFTs improving. Encephalopathy management as above.
   - hold lasix/spironolactone given borderline BPs
   - cont Pentoxifylline
   - cont to trend LFTs
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Mental status was stable on floor, slowly
   improving. Lactulose was restarted, no stools here.
   - change to lactulose enemas
   - cont rifaxamin.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: EGD on [**5-13**] showed severe portal gastropathy and
   grade II varices. The patient is s/p banding x4. He has not had further
   episodes and hct has been stable. Pt has received total of 3U pRBC. Hct
   30.0 today and stable
   - cont IV PPI
   - finished cipro for SBP ppx (now on Zosyn)
   - cont to monitor daily Hct, transfuse for Hct <23 or active bleeding
   - consider starting nadolol when stable
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable at 1.9 Secondary to EtOH cirrhosis. No signs
   of bleeding.
   - Trend coags
   - FFP prior to femoral arterial line
   .
   # Diabetes type II:
   - continue home insulin regimen

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration. The patient was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The most likely etiology is aspiration, which led to respiratory arrest. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral infiltrates at the bases, consistent with this. The patient is already being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and ampicillin for 10 days. It is important to continue these antibiotics and repeat sputum cultures. The patient should also be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated and undergo daily wake-up tests to assess respiratory status.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is partly due to sedatives and sepsis. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and should be monitored closely for signs of infection. Sedation should be changed to dexmedetomidine, and efforts should be made to wean off pressors. A central venous line should be placed to measure central venous pressure (CVP).

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The differential diagnosis for ARF includes pre-renal azotemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites and portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be
   apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and
   transferred to the MICU.
   .
   # Resp. failure:  Most likely etiology is aspiration event and
   subsequent respiratory arrest given patient was found in vomitus and
   gastric contents suctioned post-extubation.  CXR shows worsening
   bilateral infiltrates at bases consistent with this.  Was already being
   treated for possible asp. PNA with vanc/unasyn x 10 days, day 1 [**5-18**].
   Unfortunately ABG was unable to be obtained during code so unclear how
   hypoxic patient was, however oxygenating well currently.
   - Continue vanc, broadening to Zosyn for expanded GN coverage
   - Repeat sputum
   - Change to dexmedetomidine for sedation
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Daily wake-up, RSBI
   .
   # Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 60**] in part relate to sedatives. Sepsis also clearly a concern.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Changing to dexmedetomidine
   - CVL to better measure CVP
   - Cont. pressors
   .
   # ARF:
   DDx includes pre-renal from overdiuresis, ATN from hypotension. Given
   cirrhosis must also consider hepatorenal syndrome or abdominal
   compartment syndrome.
   - Hold diuretics
   - Check bladder pressure
   - Check urine lytes
   - Follow Cr/urine output
   - Talk with renal re ?midodrine and octreotide
   #. Ileus: Diagnosed on CT.  Decompressed with NGT and had resolved on
   recent KUB which was negative for obstruction.  Abdomen mote tense and
   tympanic today concerning for obstruction. [**Month (only) 60**] have been inciting event
   for aspiration on the floor.
   - surgery following, appreciate their input
   - OG tube to low wall suction
   - NPO
   - KUB now
   # EtoH Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices with
   recent UGIB.  LFTs improving. Encephalopathy management as above.
   - hold lasix/spironolactone given borderline BPs
   - cont Pentoxifylline
   - cont to trend LFTs
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Mental status was stable on floor, slowly
   improving. Lactulose was restarted, no stools here.
   - change to lactulose enemas
   - cont rifaxamin.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: EGD on [**5-13**] showed severe portal gastropathy and
   grade II varices. The patient is s/p banding x4. He has not had further
   episodes and hct has been stable. Pt has received total of 3U pRBC. Hct
   30.0 today and stable
   - cont IV PPI
   - finshed cipro for SBP ppx
   - cont to monitor daily Hct, transfuse for Hct <23 or active bleeding
   - consider starting nadolol when stable
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable at 1.9 Secondary to EtOH cirrhosis. No signs
   of bleeding.
   - Trend coags

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He was found apneic and intubated due to respiratory arrest, likely caused by aspiration. The patient is currently in the ICU, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. His condition is complicated by respiratory failure, hypotension, acute kidney injury, ileus, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy. He is receiving antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, and his labs show elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration, which has led to worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. He is being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and efforts are being made to wean him off the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including the effects of sedatives and potential sepsis. Antibiotics are being administered, and measures such as changing to dexmedetomidine for sedation, central venous line placement, and monitoring of central venous pressure are being implemented to stabilize his blood pressure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The differential diagnosis for ARF includes pre-renal azotemia from overdiuresis, acute tubular necrosis from hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and respiratory failure due to aspiration. The patient has been intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The most likely etiology is aspiration event and subsequent respiratory arrest. The patient's current condition shows worsening bilateral infiltrates at the bases consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is already being treated with vancomycin and ampicillin for possible aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to continue the antibiotics, repeat sputum culture, and change to Precedex for sedation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is partly related to sedatives. Sepsis is also a concern. The plan is to continue the antibiotics as above and change to Precedex.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal from overdiuresis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, and abdominal compartment syndrome. The plan is to hold diuretics, check bladder pressure, check urine electrolytes, follow creatinine and urine output, and discuss with renal consultant regarding midodrine and octreotide.

4. Ileus: The patient has been diagnosed"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration following intubation. The patient has been transferred to the MICU and is currently experiencing hypox respiratory failure, renal failure, and liver failure with esophageal varices. There is also evidence of recent gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to lung infection and worsen respiratory function.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection commonly seen in patients who are intubated for an extended period.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol-related cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Hepato-renal syndrome, a condition where liver dysfunction leads to kidney failure, could potentially develop.
5. Esophageal variceal bleeding: Although the patient has already experienced a recent gastrointestinal bleed, there is a risk of recurrent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration after intubation. The patient has been transferred to the MICU.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Aspiration and hypox respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration. It is reasonable to continue ventilatory support and consider changing antibiotics to pip-tazo and vancomycin.
2. Hypotension: The patient may have early sepsis from the aspiration event, along with liver failure and ileus. No evidence of bleeding is present. The plan includes continuing norepinephrine and vasopressin, supportive fluids, and the same antibiotics mentioned above.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending up from baseline (1.3), with little urine output. This could be hepato-renal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis from hypotension. Further evaluation includes checking urine electrolytes and considering a renal consult, possibly using octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Illeus: Check the patient's KUB (kidneys, ureters, and bladder) and follow serial lactate levels. Change lactulose to per rectal administration.
5. Liver failure with esophageal varices: The patient recently experienced a GI bleed, with no evidence of underlying encephalopathy as an etiology. The plan includes continuing rifaximin and lactulose.

In terms of access, the patient will need an arterial line to monitor PaO2 and blood pressure, as well as a central venous catheter (CVC).

In the ICU, the patient's care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), VAP prevention (head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up), and other measures.

The patient's current condition is critical, and the total time spent by the healthcare provider is 45 minutes. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration after intubation. The patient has been transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration, and his condition requires continued support for ventilation. It is suggested to change antibiotics to Piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo) and Vancomycin.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event, on the backdrop of liver failure and ileus. It is recommended to continue Norepinephrine (NE) and vasopressin, supportive fluids, and current antibiotics.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending up from baseline, indicating possible hepato-renal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. Further evaluation is needed, including checking urine electrolytes and consulting a renal specialist. Octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) may be considered.
4. Illeus: The patient's bowel sounds"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's current condition indicates several potential medical complications.

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to prolonged bedrest and decreased mobility. This can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores.

2. Ileus: The patient is experiencing an ileus, which is a temporary cessation of bowel motility. This can cause abdominal distension and may lead to complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation if not managed appropriately.

3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure, but it is not specified as ARDS. The low PaO2/FiO2 ratio (163) suggests significant hypoxemia. This can be attributed to the patient's underlying condition and may require mechanical ventilation support.

4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has persistent hypotension, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below the normal range. This indicates inadequate tissue perfusion and can contribute to organ dysfunction.

5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of renal dysfunction, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine levels (1.8, 2.2, 2.3) and the presence of muddy brown casts in the urine. This suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which can be caused"

   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU.
   # Resp. failure:  Most likely etiology is aspiration event and
   subsequent respiratory arrest given patient was found in vomitus and
   gastric contents suctioned post-extubation.  CXR slightly improved but
   may be due to increased PEEP.  Was already being treated for possible
   asp. PNA with vanc/meropenem (day 1 [**5-26**] of [**Last Name (un) 430**]) x 10 days, day 1
   [**5-18**].  Unfortunately ABG was unable to be obtained during code so
   unclear how hypoxic patient was, however oxygenating well currently.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory arrest and suspected aspiration pneumonia. The ABG results indicate respiratory failure, and the patient requires careful monitoring and management of their respiratory status.

2. Leukocytosis with bandemia: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with an increased number of bands, suggesting a bacterial infection. This could be indicative of aspiration pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), intraabdominal abscess, or translocation of gut flora due to ileus.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to sepsis, sedative medications, or circulatory collapse. Pressors are being administered to maintain blood pressure, and further evaluation of the patient's volume status with a central venous line is recommended.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Differential diagnoses include pre-renal azotemia from overdiuresis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and abdominal compartment syndrome.

5. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hematocrit level, which may be due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding from portal gastropathy and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy with recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient most likely experienced aspiration during intubation, leading to worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. He is being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. The plan includes repeating sputum analysis, changing to dexmedetomidine for sedation, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, and performing daily wake-up tests to assess respiratory status.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is partly due to sedatives and also suggests sepsis as a concern. The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, changing to dexmedetomidine for sedation, placing a central venous line to measure central venous pressure (CVP), continuing pressors, and monitoring closely.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The differential diagnosis for ARF includes pre-renal causes from overdiuresis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, and abdominal compartment syndrome."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient has had recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration after intubation. The patient was transferred to the MICU and is now worsening with multi-organ failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event has led to new bilateral infiltrates and a positive growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum. This indicates a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension may be a result of early sepsis from the aspiration event, especially considering the background of liver failure and ileus. There is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and there is little urine output. The urine examination suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which may be related to hypotension.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. This increases the risk of complications such as encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
5. Esophageal varices: The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which can lead to GI bleeding. Although there is currently no evidence of active"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation and transferred to the MICU. The patient has developed new bilateral infiltrates and temporal history consistent with an aspiration event. He is experiencing hypotension, likely due to early sepsis from the aspiration event on the background of liver failure and ileus. The patient also has renal failure with increasing creatinine levels and minimal urine output, potentially hepato-renal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis from hypotension. Other issues include an illeus, liver failure with esophageal varices, and recent gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event may lead to aspiration pneumonia, which can cause respiratory distress and lung infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever may indicate early sepsis, especially considering the recent aspiration event and compromised immune system due to liver failure.
3. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's renal failure could be due to hepato-renal syndrome, a condition that occurs in advanced liver disease leading to kidney dysfunction.
4. Acute tubular necrosis: The patient's renal failure could also be caused by acute tubular necrosis, which can occur due to severe hypotension and reduced"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration following intubation. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and is now showing signs of multi-organ failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed bilateral infiltrates and a history consistent with aspiration. This indicates possible pneumonia, and the growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum suggests a bacterial infection. The patient will require continued ventilatory support, and there is a concern for respiratory acidosis.

2. Volume overload and renal failure: The patient is experiencing volume overload as indicated by an increased total input and output balance. This can lead to fluid accumulation and renal dysfunction. The patient's serum creatinine levels are trending upwards, and the urine output is low. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suspected, and the patient may require renal consultation with further diagnostic tests, such as a renal ultrasound.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to aspiration pneumonia, secondary bacteremia, or another infection. The presence of GNR in the blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU.
   # Resp. failure:  Most likely etiology is aspiration event and
   subsequent respiratory arrest given patient was found in vomitus and
   gastric contents suctioned post-extubation.  CXR slightly improved but
   may be due to increased PEEP.  Was already being treated for possible
   asp. PNA with vanc/meropenem (day 1 [**5-26**] of [**Last Name (un) 430**]) x 10 days, day 1
   [**5-18**].  Unfortunately ABG was unable to be obtained during code so
   unclear how hypoxic patient was, however oxygenating well currently.
   - Continue vancomycin / meropenem
   - Change to dexmedetomidine for sedation
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Daily wake-up, RSBI
   - check ABG after A-line placement

   - Antibiotics as above
   - Changing to dexmedetomidine
   - CVL to better measure CVP
   - Cont. pressors
   # ARF: DDx includes pre-renal from overdiuresis, ATN from hypotension.
   Given cirrhosis must also consider hepatorenal syndrome or abdominal
   compartment syndrome.
   - f/u renal U/S
   - Hold diuretics
   - if renal function worsens, continue to check bladder pressures
   - f/u urine lytes
   - Follow Cr/urine output
   - Talk with renal re ?midodrine and octreotide
   - d/c standing albumin (less likely HRS)
   # Anemia: on [**5-13**] showed severe portal gastropathy and grade II
   varices. The patient is s/p banding x4. Hct 26 down from low 30s on
   admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional vs. hemolysis vs. slow UGIB

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, which has led to complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy with recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving sedation.
- The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored with frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation.
- There is evidence of leukocytosis with bandemia, suggesting possible infection. Aspiration pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), intraabdominal abscess, translocation of gut flora due to ileus, and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection are considered as potential causes.
- The patient is hypotensive, which may be related to sedatives and sepsis. Pressors have been initiated, and further evaluation for central venous pressure (CVP) is planned.
- Acute kidney injury (ARF) is suspected, with differential diagnoses including pre-renal azotemia from overdiuresis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and abdominal compartment syndrome.
- Anemia is present, and the patient has"

","The patient's chief complaint is multifocal pneumonia. The 24-hour events indicate that a renal ultrasound was negative for hydro, a preliminary CT torso showed worsening multifocal pneumonia with no change in the abdomen and pelvis. There were multiple attempts at radial arterial lines and a left dual-pressure line that failed. Empiric treatment for Clostridium difficile was started due to an increasing white blood cell count. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed with 300 white blood cells and 66% polymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin levels were ordered for the morning, and subcutaneous heparin was continued. The patient's albumin was discontinued.

The patient has allergies to Haldol and Ativan, both causing confusion and delirium. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on different dates.

The infusions include fentanyl at 25 mcg/hour, midazolam at 2 mg/hour, norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min, and vasopressin at 2.4 units/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications mentioned.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory arrest and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient has multifocal pneumonia that is worsening despite treatment. Oxygenation is slowly deteriorating. The patient is dependent on vasopressin and norepinephrine for blood pressure support. There are concerns about sepsis and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening multifocal pneumonia and dependence on vasopressors suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating despite mechanical ventilation. Frequent reassessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is required. Consideration for adjusting ventilator settings or intubation may be needed.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The presence of muddy brown casts in the urine and the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) indicate possible ARF. Monitoring renal function and maintaining euvolemia are essential. Adjustments in fluid management and diuretic therapy may be necessary.

4. Anemia: The patient's history of severe portal gastropathy and grade II varices suggests a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transf"

   Most likely etiology is aspiration event and subsequent respiratory
   arrest given patient was found in vomitus and gastric contents
   suctioned post-extubation.  CXR slightly improved but may be due to
   increased PEEP.  Was already being treated for possible asp. PNA with
   vanc/meropenem (day 1 [**5-26**] of [**Last Name (un) 430**]) x 10 days, day 1 [**5-18**].
   Unfortunately ABG was unable to be obtained during code so unclear how
   hypoxic patient was, however oxygenating well currently.

   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out GNR
   in the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant multifocal PNA with no
   evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support ventilation (will need to
   recheck gas as last gas was trending towards resp acidosis). Picture
   now complicated by volume overload and renal failure.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for sputum.
   - new Arterial line (consider axillary approach)
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - check c. dif
   - F/u final read on Abd CT
    > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop
   of liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed.
    -Cont NE and vasopressin
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - Check cortisol
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US
   - follow urine bladder pressures
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Cont Rifax and lactulose (PR)
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Access: will need an arterial line to monitor PaO2 and blood
   pressure

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He had a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration after intubation. The patient is now experiencing multi-organ failure, including respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates and a history consistent with aspiration. There is also evidence of volume overload and renal failure. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by new bilateral infiltrates on imaging and a history consistent with aspiration.
2. Volume overload: The patient has signs of volume overload, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level and low urine output. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
4. Liver failure: The patient has chronic liver disease with complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. His liver function is likely worsening, leading to coagulopathy and other systemic effects.
5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and positive cultures for"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out GNR
   in the sputum.   Will cont support ventilation (will need to recheck
   gas as last gas was trending towards resp acidosis). Picture now
   complicated by volume overload and renal failure.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for sputum.
   - new Arterial line
    > Leukocytosis:  aspiration PNA, ? SBP and translocation of GNR into
   the blood stream,  ? c dif. Or New SBP? Or secondary BP
   - check c. dif and start empiric therapy for c. dif with PO Vanco and
   Metronidazole
   - diagnostic paracentesis today
   - CT scan of chest abd and pelvis (PO and PR contrast with no IV)
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed.
    -Cont NE and vasopressin
   - Cont supportive fluid
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension.
   - Renal consult: f/u renal U/S
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   - recheck Hct this afternoon and  d/w liver team.
     > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Cont Rifax and lactulose (PR)
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Access: will need an arterial line to monitor PaO2 and blood

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, leading to worsening multi-organ failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is now complicated by volume overload and renal failure. There are new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with an aspiration event, which is growing out Gram-Negative Rods (GNR) in the sputum.

2. Leukocytosis: This may be due to aspiration pneumonia, possibly secondary bacterial translocation into the bloodstream, or new spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Empiric therapy for C. diff should be initiated.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event, on the backdrop of liver failure and ileus. Continuous nasogastric (NE) and vasopressin support are required.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward from baseline, indicating renal failure. This may be"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration. He was intubated and transferred to the MICU. The patient is now experiencing multi-organ failure, including respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates and temporal history consistent with aspiration. There is also evidence of multifocal pneumonia without cavitation on CT scan. The patient's condition is complicated by volume overload and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which is already indicated by the new bilateral infiltrates seen on imaging.

2. Sepsis: The patient may be at risk for sepsis due to the aspiration event, especially considering his compromised immune system caused by liver failure. His hypotension could be an early sign of sepsis.

3. Liver failure: The patient's history of cirrhosis and encephalopathy suggests ongoing liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as esophageal varices and coagulopathy.

4. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate renal failure, which may be exacerbated by hypotension and fluid overload.

5. Anemia: The patient's worsening hemoglobin levels suggest anemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He required invasive ventilation and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/49 to 119/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for impaired skin integrity. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and low total CO2 levels. Other lab results are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
   - Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high inflation pressures.
   - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) from injurious ventilator settings.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Septic shock due to the underlying infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since May 27th. He has also had multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's condition has been complicated by acute kidney injury (ARF), anemia, ileus, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy. His liver function tests (LFTs) have shown improvement, but he remains at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if proper ventilation and oxygenation support is not maintained.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent sepsis progression.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to manage this condition by avoiding triggers, such as constipation, and using appropriate medications like lactulose.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's muddy brown casts in urine indicate acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which"

- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse-related cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy.
- The patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration, and was intubated.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.
- The patient's vital signs show tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 93-101 mmHg, and a heart rate of 86 beats per minute.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) with muddy brown casts in the urine and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 28.1 K/uL.
- The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, likely secondary to chronic blood loss from portal gastropathy.
- The patient has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by altered mental status.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but there is still evidence of liver dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory arrest and suspected aspiration during intubation.

The patient's current condition is complicated by several medical issues, including aspiration and hypox respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, renal failure, anemia, liver failure with esophageal varices, and volume overload. The patient requires mechanical ventilation support, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continuous renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The presence of new bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging and growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum culture suggests a possible aspiration pneumonia.

2. Multiorgan Failure: The patient's worsening condition indicates potential multiorgan failure. The presence of new biliary infiltrates, renal failure, and liver dysfunction may suggest systemic involvement.

3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and positive sputum culture for GNR indicate an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but vancomycin levels need to be monitored.

4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to sepsis secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), was found apneic with respiratory arrest, and likely aspirated during intubation. He was transferred to the MICU, where he is now experiencing multiorgan failure. The patient has developed new bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration, and his sputum culture grew Enterobacter cloacae. He also has multifocal pneumonia, volume overload, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to aspiration, which has led to new bilateral infiltrates and worsening multifocal pneumonia. Continuous ventilation support is required.
2. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of volume overload, which is contributing to renal failure. Adjustments in fluid management are necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, indicating a worsening multifocal pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and the antibiotic regimen should be adjusted based on culture results.
4. Ileus: The patient has developed an ileus, likely due to the use of Fentanyl. Minimizing Fentanyl use and providing supportive care are recommended.
5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to early seps"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and cirrhosis. He presented with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He had an upper gastrointestinal bleed and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and transferred to the MICU.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with sepsis and respiratory failure. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 162 mmHg, and a bicarbonate level of 19 mEq/L. His oxygen saturation is 97% on a FiO2 of 60%. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and the source of infection should be identified and treated accordingly.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by muddy brown casts in the urine and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His serum creatinine is slowly improving, and it is important to maintain euvolemia and trend the creatinine levels.

The patient has anemia, which is likely related to chronic blood loss from his gastrointestinal bleed. He has previously undergone banding for esophageal varices. His hemoglobin concentration should be monitored, and he should be transfused if his hemoglobin falls below 23 or if there is active bleeding.

The patient also has ileus, as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 70-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54-92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive.

The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, anemia, ileus, ethanol cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Plan:
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
- Wean pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
- Start steroids every 8 hours.
- Follow up vancomycin levels.
- Obtain central venous pressure (CVP) measurement.
- Increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 12 cmH2O.
- Monitor creatinine levels and maintain euvolemia.
- Trend hematocrit levels.
- Transfuse for hemoglobin <23 or"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Increasing PEEP requirments overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   - Cont higher PEEP protocol
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction)
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - c. dif neg thus far
   > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial today.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Now has evidence of
   persistent hypotension on two pressors with an inappropriately low
   cortisol
   - Start hydrocortisone
    -Cont NE and vasopressin
   - Cont supportive fluid
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**Month (only) 60**] be able to consider
   an attempt diuresis if able to wean off pressors
   - follow urine bladder pressures
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Can not receive lactulose or rifax as there is NO absorption PR given

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He is currently in the ICU due to multiple organ failure, including respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates and a history of aspiration. The patient also has liver failure, renal failure, anemia, and esophageal varices with recent gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with multi-drug resistant enterobacter in the sputum and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is also a mention of worsening multifocal pneumonia.

2. Aspiration: The patient continues to have significant aspiration of gastric secretions, which increases the risk of further respiratory complications.

3. Volume overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and cardiac issues.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, indicating renal failure. This may require dialysis or other renal support measures.

5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, leading to encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite pressor support, suggesting potential sepsis or other causes of distributive shock.

7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating anemia. This could be due to dilutional effects from renal"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was intubated due to respiratory arrest. The patient is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and is worsening with multi-organ failure. He has new bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, consistent with aspiration, and is growing out Enterobacter cloacae in his sputum. The patient has significant gastric secretions aspiration, volume overload, renal failure, and worsening multifocal pneumonia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: Continue ventilatory support and increase PEEP requirements. 
2. Enterobacter cloacae infection: Vancomycin and meropenem therapy.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vancomycin IV by level, Vancomycin PR, and change to PO).
4. Leukocytosis: No evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction.
5. Ileus: Off Fentanyl. Reglan trial today.
6. Hypotension: Start hydrocortisone, continue NE and vasopressin, and supportive fluid.
7. Renal failure: Trending up creatinine from baseline 1.3 with little urine output. Follow urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation (will need to recheck gas as last gas was trending towards
   resp acidosis). Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for eneterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   - change back to volume control based on ABG
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction)
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - c. dif neg thus
   > Illeus: on CT, will try to minimize Fentanyl use.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Now has evidence of
   persistent hypotension on two pressors with an inappropriately low
   cortisol
   - Start hydrocortisone
    -Cont NE and vasopressin
   - Cont supportive fluid
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US
   - follow urine bladder pressures
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Can not receive lactulose or rifax as there is NO absorption PR given
   his illeus
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is now in the MICU with worsening multiorgan failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the assessment and plan are as follows:

1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration, which suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. This is further supported by the fact that the patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has significant multifocal PNA without evidence of cavitation. This indicates a possible worsening infection in the lungs.

3. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing volume overload, as indicated by the fluid balance chart showing an excess of fluids received compared to output. This can lead to renal failure, which is evident from the rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which suggests an infection. Given the presence of pneumonia, this may be due to the worsening lung infection.

5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite the use of two pressors. This could be due to early sepsis from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, who was admitted to the MICU due to apnea with respiratory arrest and suspected aspiration pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, ileus, mental status changes, and complications from chronic ETOH abuse including encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50% and PEEP 15 cmH2O. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's blood cultures have shown sensitivity to enterobacter from sputum. The plan includes weaning off pressors, attempting to extubate if possible, and continuing aggressive suctioning and medications to promote gut motility. Further evaluation and treatment are needed for the patient's conditions."

Assessment and Plan:

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are to be continued, and cultures are to be followed up. Pressors are to be weaned while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg. IV hydrocortisone is to be continued at 50 mg IV q8hrs. Aggressive suctioning, Reglan, and erythromycin will help with gut promotility, and an OG tube is to be placed on low intermittent suction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Muddy brown casts in urine indicate acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function is to be trended, and improvement is expected.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe portal gastropathy and grade II varices. Daily hematocrit (Hct) is to be monitored, and transfusion for Hct <21 or active bleeding is recommended. IV PPI is to be continued.
4. Ileus: OGT is to be placed on low intermittent wall suction. No obstruction is present. Reglan"

   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU.
   # Sepsis / Resp. failure:  Multifocal pneumonia most likely aspiration
   pneumonia.
   -continue broad spectrum abx, only + culture data is meropenem
   sensitive enterobacter from sputum
   -continue to wean pressors to keep MAP > 70mmHg (today given possible
   hepatorenal syndrome post-paracentesis)
   -continue IV hydrocort at 50mg IV q8hrs
   -continue aggressive suctioning and reglan / erythromycin to help w/
   gut promotility, OG tube to low intermittent suction
   -creatinine slightly higher following large volume para (4L), with
   improvement in oxygentation; consider period paracentesis to decrease
   compromise of his respiratory status related to abdominal compression
   - f/u cultures- blood and sputum
   -attempt to wean FiO2 and PEEP
   # ARF: Muddy brown casts in urine, [**1-27**] ATN initially; ? component of
   hepatorenal syndrome
   -trend, slowly improving
   - recheck urine lytes
   # Anemia: on [**5-13**] showed severe portal gastropathy and grade II
   varices. The patient is s/p banding x4.
   -continue to trend, currently stable
   -daily hct
   -transfuse for Hct <21 or active bleeding
   -IV PPI
   #. Ileus: OGT to low intermittent wall suction, no obstruction
   - reglan, erythrmycin
   - 4L para for illeus on [**5-29**]
   # Mental status: depressed at least from hepatic encephalopathy, in
   addition to toxic metabolic insults (sedation).  If improves from ileus
   standpoint can start lactulose.
   # EtoH Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices with
   recent UGIB.  LFTs improving. Encephalopathy management as above
   - hold lasix/spironolactone given hypotension
   - cont to trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: INR elevated

","Based on the provided information, the patient has a history of ETOH cirrhosis with complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration following intubation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis/Respiratory failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and the patient's condition should be closely monitored.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly higher after a large volume paracentesis. There is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, which should be considered and managed accordingly.

3. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is depressed due to hepatic encephalopathy, as well as toxic metabolic insults (sedation). Lactulose can be considered if the patient improves from ileus standpoint.

4. Anemia: The patient has severe portal gastropathy and grade II varices. Anemia should be managed with transfusion for Hct <21 or active bleeding, and IV PPI can be continued.

5. Ileus: The patient has ileus, which can be managed with reglan and erythromycin. A 4L paracentesis has already been performed.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Increasing PEEP requirments overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA. With some improvement in O2 in response to
   paracenetesis.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   - Cont higher PEEP protocol for today.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - c. dif neg thus far
   > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**5-30**] and s/p 4L paracentesis with no
   substanative improvement in illeus
   - cont care as above
   - KUB for ? OG tube position,
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Now has evidence of
   persistent hypotension on two pressors with an inappropriately low
   cortisol
   - Cont  hydrocortisone
    -Cont NE and wean as tolerated
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin).
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - no plans for diuresis given tenuous renal function.
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Can not receive lactulose or rifax as there is NO absorption PR given
   his illeus (will see if any improvement today).
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) event and was found apneic with respiratory arrest likely due to aspiration. He was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) where he is currently being treated.

The patient's current condition is complicated by multiple organ failure. He has new bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration and hypoxic respiratory failure. There is evidence of significant multifocal pneumonia without cavitation on computed tomography (CT) scan. He also has volume overload and worsening renal failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Ventilatory support to assist with breathing due to respiratory failure.
2. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole for multi-drug resistant (MDR) Enterobacter cloacae infection in the sputum.
3. Higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements to improve oxygenation.
4. Paracentesis to remove excess fluid from the abdomen.
5. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with meropenem, Flagyl, vancomycin IV by level, and vancomycin per rectum.
6. Continuous care for ileus, including adding erythromycin to improve bowel motility.

   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Increasing PEEP requirments overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   - Cont higher PEEP protocol
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction)
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - c. dif neg thus far
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial today.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Now has evidence of
   persistent hypotension on two pressors with an inappropriately low
   cortisol
   - Start hydrocortisone

   an attempt diuresis if able to wean off pressors
   - follow urine bladder pressures
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Can not receive lactulose or rifax as there is NO absorption PR given

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has had recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory arrest and suspected aspiration. The patient's condition has worsened, with new bilateral infiltrates and a history consistent with aspiration. He has developed enterobacter cloacae in his sputum and significant multifocal pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing volume overload and renal failure. His current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, erythromycin, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/50 mmHg to 109/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ failure, including respiratory, renal, and hepatic dysfunction. Potential complications include aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, multi-drug resistant infections, volume overload, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented to the ICU with respiratory arrest and was intubated. The patient has a complicated medical history, including encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and multifocal pneumonia. He continues to experience significant aspiration of gastric secretions and has developed worsening multiorgan failure. The patient's condition is further complicated by volume overload, renal failure, and infections, including enterobacter cloacae in the sputum.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration. He will continue to receive ventilatory support.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient likely has worsening multifocal pneumonia, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued.
3. Ileus: Despite paracentesis and the addition of erythromycin, there has been no substantial improvement in the ileus.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event, on the backdrop of liver failure and ileus. Hydrocortisone has been initiated, and the patient will continue on norepinephrine and supportive fluids.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating renal failure. It is a concern that the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, leading to transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia. Current management includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, weaning off pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 70 mmHg, continuing IV hydrocortisone, aggressive suctioning, and medications to promote gut motility. The patient's renal function has worsened due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) initially, and there is suspicion of hepatorenal syndrome now. Renal follow-up will be done to consider midodrine/octreotide and albumin administration. The patient also has anemia, ileus, mental status changes, and complications related to his underlying etoh cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to aspiration pneumonia and abdominal compression from ascites. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support may be required.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's worsening renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there have been several significant events over the past 24 hours.

Firstly, the patient's output of oral gastrointestinal tract (OGT) decreased, and a KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) scan showed the presence of OGT in the stomach. In response to this, hepatology recommended trophic tube feeds, which were initiated and increased to 20cc/hr.

Secondly, the patient's Vancomycin trough level was measured at 20.3, and the timing of the dose was switched to 8pm.

Thirdly, the bladder pressure was recorded at 7-3, indicating a potential issue with increased pressure in the bladder. Additionally, the patient's urine electrolytes demonstrated pre-renal azotemia, and the creatinine level was climbing. The patient was given 1L of normal saline, which resulted in a mildly worse creatinine level of 2.1, consistent with hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient has allergies to Haldol (Oral) and Ativan (Oral), both causing confusion/delirium. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on 2172-5-30 at 08:00 PM, consisting of Vancomycin, Meropenem, Metronidazole, and Erythromycin.

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving Norepinephrine at a rate of 0.02 mcg/Kg/min. Other ICU medications include Pantoprazole (Protonix) started on 2172-5-30 at 08:00 PM and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) initiated on 2172-5-30 at 10:29 PM.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. Flow sheet data as of 2172-5-31 06:43 AM indicates the following vital signs: temperature (Tmax) at 37.3 C (99.2 F), current temperature (Tcurrent) at 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate (HR) ranging between 68-93 bpm, blood pressure (BP) fluctuating between 73/42 mmHg and 117/61 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 99%, and sinus rhythm (SR) as the heart rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 104.4 kg, with a height of 69 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is at 11 mmHg, and bladder pressure is at 10 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,914 mL, with an output of 1,042 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,872 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease stage IV. The patient was initially diagnosed with severe sepsis and septic shock secondary to a hospital-acquired pneumonia. He presented with altered mental status, hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of organ dysfunction. The patient was promptly resuscitated with fluids and vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated.

Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. He developed an ileus, which required nasogastric tube placement and trophic tube feeds. He also experienced episodes of decreased output from his open gastrointestinal tract (OGT), and a subsequent imaging study revealed the presence of OGT in his stomach. Hepatology recommended switching to trophic tube feeds, which were increased to 20cc/hr.

The patient's respiratory status has been a concern as well. He required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His current ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, leading to transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory Failure: Multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia.
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- Wean pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 70 mmHg.
- Continue IV hydrocortisone at 50 mg IV q8hrs.
- Continue aggressive suctioning and reglan/erythromycin to help with gut promotility, OG tube to low intermittent suction.
- Consider period paracentesis to decrease respiratory compromise related to abdominal compression.
- Follow-up cultures: blood and sputum.
- Attempt to wean FiO2 and PEEP.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Muddy brown casts in urine, initially thought to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN); now questioning the component of hepatorenal syndrome given unresponsiveness to 1L normal saline bolus, with electrolytes demonstrating pre-renal.
- Discuss with hepatology regarding albumin vs. midodrine/octreotide.
- Trend slowly improving.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Increasing PEEP requirments overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA. With some improvement in O2 in response to
   paracenetesis.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   - Cont higher PEEP protocol for today.
   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - c. dif neg thus far
   > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**5-30**] and s/p 4L paracentesis with no
   substanative improvement in illeus
   - cont care as above
    > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop
   of liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Now has evidence of
   persistent hypotension on two pressors with an inappropriately low
   cortisol
   - Cont  hydrocortisone
    -Cont NE and wean as tolerated
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin).
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - no plans for diuresis given tenuous renal function.
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Can not receive lactulose or rifax as there is NO absorption PR given
   his illeus (will see if any improvement today).
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was intubated due to respiratory arrest and suspected aspiration. The patient is currently in the MICU and is deteriorating, with worsening multi-organ failure. 

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory Failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration. He also has significant aspiration of gastric secretions.
2. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing volume overload and renal failure, as indicated by an increasing PEEP requirement, ascites, and multifocal pneumonia.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient likely has worsening multifocal pneumonia, with no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to worsening multifocal pneumonia or steroid use.
5. Ileus: The patient has an ileus, as evidenced by a CT scan showing no improvement despite trials of Fentanyl and Reglan. Erythromycin has been added to the treatment plan.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event, on the background of liver failure and ileus. No evidence of bleeding is"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually (slowly improving
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)  (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin) for planned 14 day
   course.
   - Cont higher PEEP protocol for today (wean FiO2 to 40% then start to
   back off PEEP)
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
   - c. dif neg thus far
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**5-30**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM)
   - cont care as above
   - add back lactulose [**5-31**]
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**])
    -Off NE (aim for MAP > 65)
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), no response to fluid challenge (potentially suggestive of
   HRS)
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - no plans for diuresis given tenuous renal function.
   -Will review midodrine/octrotide use with liver team moving forward
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - [**Month (only) 60**] be able to restart lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory arrest and suspected aspiration after intubation.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: He has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration. There is also growth of Enterobacter cloacae in the sputum, along with multifocal pneumonia seen on a CT scan from May 26th.
2. Volume overload and renal failure: The patient is experiencing significant volume overload and renal failure, which may be related to his previous aspiration event and the use of higher PEEP requirements.
3. Aspiration of gastric secretions: The patient continues to have significant aspiration of gastric secretions.
4. Leukocytosis: There is evidence of worsening multifocal pneumonia, with no new peritonitis or bowel obstruction. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued.
5. Ileus: The patient's ileus has improved with the addition of erythromycin and a 4L paracentesis.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event, along with liver failure and ileus. No evidence of bleed has been found"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU now worsening with multi organ failure.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Increasing PEEP requirments overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA. With some improvement in O2 in response to
   paracenetesis.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])
   - Cont higher PEEP protocol for today.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx (Meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level,
   Vanco PR and change to PO)
   - c. dif neg thus far
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**5-30**] and s/p 4L paracentesis with no
   substanative improvement in illeus
   - cont care as above
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Now has evidence of
   persistent hypotension on two pressors with an inappropriately low
   cortisol
   - Cont  hydrocortisone
    -Cont NE and wean as tolerated
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin).
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - no plans for diuresis given tenuous renal function.
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - Can not receive lactulose or rifax as there is NO absorption PR given
   his illeus (will see if any improvement today).
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, and he is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient is experiencing multiorgan failure, including respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates and a history consistent with aspiration. He has pneumonia with no evidence of cavitation and is growing Enterobacter cloacae in his sputum. The patient also has volume overload and renal failure. He requires higher PEEP requirements and has improvement in oxygenation after paracentesis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: Continue ventilatory support. The patient continues to have significant aspiration of gastric secretions.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient likely has worsening multifocal pneumonia, with no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, Flagyl, Vanco IV by level, Vanco PR, and change to PO).
3. Ileus: The patient's ileus is unresponsive to Fentanyl and Reglan. Erythromycin was added, and a 4L paracentesis was performed without substantial improvement.
4. Hypotension: The patient may have early sepsis from the aspiration event on the background of"

   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU.
   # Sepsis / Resp. failure:  Multifocal pneumonia most likely aspiration
   pneumonia.
   -continue broad spectrum abx, only + culture data is meropenem
   sensitive enterobacter from sputum; d/c flagyl as no evidence of c.
   diff
   -continue to wean pressors to keep MAP > 70mmHg
   -continue IV hydrocort at 50mg IV q8hrs, stop steroids tomorrow
   -continue aggressive suctioning and reglan to help w/ gut promotility
   OG tube to low intermittent suction
   - f/u cultures- blood and sputum
   - wean  to PS FiO2 to 40 % and ABG afterwards
   - vanc ([**5-18**] day 1) and [**Last Name (un) 430**] ([**5-26**]) x 14 days for VAP
   - advance ETT 2 cm
   # ARF: Muddy brown casts in urine, [**1-27**] ATN initially; ? component of
   hepatorenal syndrome now, given unresponsive to 1L normal saline bolus,
   slightly improved with albumin, with electrolytes demonstrating
   prerenal.
   - renal following

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis who presented with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and admitted to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being weaned off pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 70 mmHg.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has muddy brown casts in his urine, suggesting ATN initially, but it may be a component of hepatorenal syndrome now. The patient has shown slight improvement with albumin administration and is being closely monitored.
3. Anemia: The patient has severe portal gastropathy and grade II varices. He has undergone banding procedures and is being transfused for Hct <21 or active bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors are also being used.
4. Ileus: The patient has ongoing ileus, but there is no obstruction. Trophic feedings have been initiated, and metoclopramide is being continued.
5. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is depressed due to hepatic encephalopathy and toxic metabolic insults. Lact"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been in the ICU since 05/24/2172. The recent events include decreasing the FiO2 to 40%, suspected renal failure due to hypovolemia and hypoperfusion, maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65, consultation with Hepatology with no recommendations, discontinuation of Flagyl, administration of albumin 25g x 1 for likely Hepatic Venous Regurgitation Syndrome (HRS), hold on vancomycin due to high level of resistance, sputum culture results showing susceptibility to meropenem, and a change in antibiotic regimen.

The patient has allergies to Haldol (Haloperidol) and Ativan (Lorazepam). The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 05/30/2172 at 08:00 PM, metronidazole on 05/31/2172 at 08:00 AM, meropenem on 05/31/2172 at 08:00 PM, and erythromycin on 06/01/2172 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various infusions including pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications. There are no significant changes to the patient's medical and family history.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of confusion and delirium. The patient's FiO2 was decreased to 40% and renal failure is suspected due to hypovolemia and hypoperfusion, with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 65. Hepatology recommendations were not provided. Flagyl was discontinued, and albumin was given at 25g x 1 for likely hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Vancomycin levels were high, so it was held. Sputum culture showed susceptibility to meropenem. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) assist, with a tidal volume set at 550mL, respiratory rate set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. ABG results indicate a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 295, pH of 7.36, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals copious oral secretions, diffuse ronchi bilaterally, moderate abdominal distension, ascites, anasarca, and weeping fluid. Neurological assessment shows minimal responsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 96 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/59 to 129/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,467mL and output of 1,288mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,179mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.4 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.2 g/dL, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 240 mg/dL, low sodium (Na+) of 130 mEq/L, low potassium (K+) of 3.9 mEq/L, high glucose (Glucose) of 240 mg/dL, low platelet count (Plt) of 114 K/uL, high creatinine (Cr) of 2.0 mg/dL, low calcium (Ca++) of 8.5 mg/dL, and low magnesium (Mg++) of 2.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's high WBC count and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which may lead to sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The high BUN and low urine output indicate renal dysfunction, potentially due to hypovolemia and hypoperfusion.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's liver dysfunction and low urine output raise the possibility of HRS.
5. Pneumonia: The presence of diffuse ronchi bilaterally and copious oral secretions may suggest pneumonia.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and the need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of stress ul"

   place on [**5-30**], with trophic feedings initiated.
   - continue metoclopramide, erythromycin
   - likely start lactulose tomorrow
   # Mental status: depressed at least from hepatic encephalopathy, in
   addition to toxic metabolic insults (sedation).  If improves from ileus
   standpoint can start lactulose.
   # EtoH Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices with
   recent UGIB.  LFTs improving. Encephalopathy management as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, as well as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy with recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is showing improvement in oxygenation. His creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's anemia is related to chronic blood loss from portal gastropathy and varices. He is also experiencing ileus, and lactulose has been initiated to manage hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's liver function tests are improving. His coagulopathy is being managed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions. The patient has a history of diabetes type II, which is relatively well-controlled on his current regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to infection and inflammation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. This could be due to ATN or hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
     >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually (slowly improving
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin) for planned 14 day course.
   - Trial PS today and see how he does.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM)
   - cont care as above
   - Add back lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**].
    -Off NE (aim for MAP > 65)
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will trial gentle
   diuresis today.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - Gentle diuresis with albumin today.
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with multiorgan failure. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration. There is also evidence of enterobacter cloacae in the sputum. The patient requires continued support for ventilation.

2. Aspiration: The patient continues to have significant aspiration of gastric secretions.

3. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient has volume overload and renal failure, as indicated by the high PEEP requirements overnight.

4. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which may contribute to the respiratory failure.

5. Multifocal Pneumonia (MPPN): The patient likely has a worsening multifocal pneumonia, with no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction.

6. Leukocytosis: The rise in white blood cell count may be due to worsening MPPN or a response to steroid treatment.

7. Ileus: The patient has ileus, as shown on CT scan. There was no improvement with Fentanyl, but Reglan trial on 05/29 showed no improvement either. Erythromycin was added on [Date range (1) 9262], and a 4L paracentesis was performed. The patient is slowly improving, tolerating PO, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He presented with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy, and recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation. He has been transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and is currently worsening with multi-organ failure. The patient's condition is complicated by aspiration of gastric secretions, volume overload, renal failure, and multi-focal pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient's recent aspiration event has led to new bilateral infiltrates, consistent with aspiration pneumonia. This could progress further and affect oxygenation.
2. Enterobacter cloacae infection: The patient's sputum culture showed growth of Enterobacter cloacae. This could indicate a hospital-acquired infection and may require adjustments to the antibiotic regimen.
3. Multi-focal Pneumonia: The patient has significant multifocal pneumonia with no evidence of cavitation. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially systemic infection.
4. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of volume overload and renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. Ileus: The patient has developed ileus, which is a temporary cessation of bowel motility"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
     >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually (slowly improving
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin) for planned 14 day course.
   - Trial PS today and see how he does.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM)
   - cont care as above
   - Add back lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**].
    -Off NE (aim for MAP > 65)
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will trial gentle
   diuresis today.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - Gentle diuresis with albumin today.
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration, and subsequently intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient has multiorgan failure and is slowly improving.

Potential medical complications include:

1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory Failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration, leading to respiratory failure. He continues to have significant aspiration of gastric secretions.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal PNA, as evidenced by new infiltrates on the chest imaging. The causative organism is Enterobacter cloacae.

3. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing volume overload, which has led to renal failure. This is indicated by high PEEP requirements, ascites, and worsening renal function.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a worsening multifocal PNA or possible sepsis.

5. Ileus: The patient has developed ileus, as shown on CT scan. Initially, he was given Fentanyl and tried on Reglan, but without improvement. Erythromycin was added, and he"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented to the ICU with respiratory arrest and multiorgan failure, but is now slowly improving. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, volume overload, renal failure, leukocytosis, ileus, hypotension, anemia, liver failure with esophageal varices, and encephalopathy. He is receiving various treatments and interventions for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a history consistent with aspiration. This condition is now complicated by Enterobacter cloacae infection in the sputum.
2. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient has significant volume overload and renal failure, indicated by high PEEP requirements, fluid accumulation, and rising creatinine levels.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to worsening multifocal pneumonia.
4. Ileus: The patient has an ileus, as evidenced by the CT scan showing significant multifocal PNA and no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event or liver failure.
6. Anemia: The patient has worsening anemia, possibly due to dilutional effects from renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and diabetes type II.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, had good stool output, and no residuals with tube feeds. The patient was switched from assisted control ventilation (AC) to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the PEEP was decreased from 15 to 12. However, the patient's PaO2 decreased to 74 in the evening, so the PEEP was increased back to 15, which improved the PaO2 to 135.

The patient also received 25g of albumin and 10mg IV lasix without much response, and it was noted that a higher dose may be needed in the morning. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/62 to 132/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there are muddy brown casts in the urine, indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has had recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He has been intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL, spontaneous Vt of 760 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, and a saturation of oxygen (SpO2) of 98%. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) of 95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%.

   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually (slowly improving
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin) for planned 14 day course.
   - Trial PS today and see how he does.
   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
   > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-29**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM)
   - cont care as above
   - Add back lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**].
    -Off NE (aim for MAP > 65)
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will trial gentle
   diuresis today.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - Gentle diuresis with albumin today.
     > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]

- The patient also has volume overload and renal failure. He requires high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) overnight.
- The patient has been on vancomycin and meropenem for empiric coverage, with planned 14-day courses. Vancomycin will be dosed based on levels, and meropenem will be continued for MDR enterobacter.
- A trial of pressure support (PS) ventilation has been initiated to assess the patient's response.
- The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to worsening multifocal PNA. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, and Flagyl has been stopped.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually improving,
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day course)
   - Cont PS and slow wean of PEEP. (D9 of intubation) , will have to
   think about  tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
   > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Cont lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**]. Last day
   is today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), respiratory arrest, and likely aspiration. He was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with multiorgan failure. The patient has been slowly improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient had a respiratory arrest and developed new bilateral infiltrates, suggesting aspiration. This has led to the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and high PEEP requirements.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's CT scan showed significant multifocal PNA without evidence of cavitation. This indicates a severe lung infection that may be contributing to his respiratory distress.
3. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input-output balance, indicating volume overload. This can lead to worsening renal function, as evidenced by an increase in creatinine levels.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an ongoing infection or worsening multifocal PNA.
5. Illeus: The patient had a paralytic ileus, which has improved with the use of Reglan and erythromycin. However, he still requires careful monitoring and management.
6. Hypotension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse-related cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He presented to the ICU with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration, multiorgan failure, and worsening interstitial/alveolar opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has shown gradual improvement but still faces several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration, which resulted in new bilateral infiltrates. This suggests the possibility of ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's sputum culture revealed enterobacter cloacae, and a CT scan showed significant multifocal PNA. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for this infection.
3. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of volume overload, as indicated by high PEEP requirements and an increase in central venous pressure. This has led to renal failure, with a rising creatinine level and decreased urine output.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting a worsening infection or inflammatory response.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient has been experiencing encephalopathy, likely due to multi-factorial causes including hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, toxic-metabolic factors, and sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually improving,
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day course)
   - Cont PS and slow wean of PEEP. (D9 of intubation) , will have to
   think about  tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
   > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Cont lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**]. Last day
   is today.
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will trial gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - Gentle diuresis with albumin today.
   - follow electrolytes
     > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
   > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has been admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure and is slowly improving. The patient has experienced various medical complications including aspiration and hypox respiratory failure, volume overload and renal failure, leukocytosis, ileus, hypotension, anemia, liver failure with esophageal varices, encephalopathy, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory Failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration, indicating the possibility of further respiratory distress.
2. Volume Overload and Renal Failure: The patient has shown signs of volume overload, which could lead to worsening renal function if not managed properly.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's rising white blood cell count suggests a worsening multifocal pneumonia, indicating the need for continued broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
4. Ileus: The patient's improvement after stopping fentanyl and starting erythromycin suggests that ileus may continue to be a concern.
5. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension may be due to early sepsis from the aspiration event on the backdrop of liver failure and ileus.
6. Anemia: The patient's worsening hemoglobin levels indicate the need for ongoing monitoring and management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia, which led to intubation and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). 

The patient's medical conditions include sepsis with respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and vancomycin has been discontinued since it has been on for 16 days. The patient is also being weaned off hydrocortisone and Reglan IV.

Acute renal failure is improving, and the patient is being diuresed with albumin and Lasix. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are being monitored. Anemia management involves transfusion for hemoglobin (Hct) levels below 21 or active bleeding, and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is being administered.

The patient's mental status is improving, and lactulose is being increased to three times a day. The patient has a history of ETOH cirrhosis with complications of encephalopathy, ascites, varices, and recent UGIB. Liver function tests (LFTs) are improving.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient has an altered mental status, which is not due to delirium. They also have ascites, hyperglycemia, altered nutrition, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and hypotension, but there is no indication of septic shock.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/68 to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 671 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 85 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 23.2 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 8.3 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 115 mg/dL, low potassium (K+) level of 3.0 mEq/L, high sodium (Na+) level of 148 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 20 mEq/L, and normal creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL. The liver function tests show elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, as well as elevated total bilirubin (T Bili) level.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding with Nutren Pulmonary at a rate of 30 mL/hour. The patient's glycemic control is being managed through insulin administration. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and arterial line.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Nosocomial pneumonia: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and the use of central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT formation.

3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and the use of corticosteroids may predispose them to the development of stress ulcers in"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually improving,
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day
   course)
   - Cont PS and slow wean of PEEP. (D9 of intubation) , will have to
   think about  tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-27**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Cont lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**]. Last day
   is today.
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will trial gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-2**] range)
   - Gentle diuresis with albumin today.
   - follow electrolytes
     > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
   > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is
   stopping today). We will cont to follow.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, resulting in encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration, prompting intubation and transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with multi-organ failure. He is now slowly improving.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications:

1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and a temporal history consistent with aspiration, which has improved over the last few days. He also has multifocal pneumonia (PNA) without evidence of cavitation. He is experiencing volume overload and renal failure.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient likely has a worsening multifocal PNA, with no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued.

3. Ileus: The patient has been on Fentanyl, but now off. He underwent a 4L paracentesis and was given erythromycin, which showed improvement. He is tolerating oral intake and has had a bowel movement.

4. Hypotension: The patient may have early sepsis from the aspiration event, on the background of liver failure and ileus. He previously required two pressors but is now able to be weaned off. He was started on hydroc"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving, concern
   today for increasing WBC.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually improving,
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day
   course)
   - Cont PS and slow wean of PEEP. (D9 of intubation) , Will have to
   think about  tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction.  Will need to reculture for rising WBC, may not have fever
   given liver dysfunction.
   - remove the IJ on the left
   - cultures from all in dwelling lines, check urine, sputum and c. dif
   - d/w liver re: repeat paracentesis
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
   - recheck cultures (blood, urine, c. dif), if spikes would favor
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Cont lactulose
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**].
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-5**] range)
   - Cont Gentle diuresis with albumin today, goal 500 cc negative.
   - follow electrolytes
     > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
   > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is
   stopping today). We will cont to follow.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He has experienced several medical complications and conditions, including aspiration and hypox respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, volume overload, renal failure, leukocytosis, ileus, hypotension, anemia, liver failure with esophageal varices, encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, and additional issues noted by the ICU resident.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Aspiration and hypox respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and temporal history consistent with aspiration. Enterobacter cloacae is growing in the sputum, and there is significant multifocal pneumonia on CT without evidence of cavitation. This condition has improved over the last few days.
2. Volume overload and renal failure: The patient has been gradually improving but is experiencing high PEEP requirements overnight. There is concern for volume overload and renal failure due to ascites, volume, and multifocal pneumonia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is increasing, indicating a worsening multifocal pneumonia. No evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction is present.
4. Ileus: The patient had ileus on CT but is now off Fentanyl. A trial of Reglan has been initiated with improvement, and erythrom"

   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually improving,
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day

   > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction.  Will need to reculture for rising WBC, may not have fever
   given liver dysfunction.
   - remove the IJ on the left

   - d/w liver re: repeat paracentesis
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])

   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Cont lactulose
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**].

   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia after intubation and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 9 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 188, and a ventilation/perfusion mismatch. 

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, icterus, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 74 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and hypoalbuminemia. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 20.5, indicating a coagulopathy. 

Laboratory results also indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 23.2 K/uL, anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 25.7%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 78 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The patient's electrolyte levels show hypernatremia with a sodium level of 149 mEq/L. 

The patient's current medications include meropenem, vancomycin, insulin, heparin sodium, midazolam (Versed), furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, anemia, ileus, mental status changes, ETOH cirrhosis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes type II. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, progression of acute kidney injury, development of hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening coagulopathy, and further electrolyte imbalances."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated, transferred to the MICU, and diagnosed with sepsis and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia. Continuing meropenem for a total 14-day course is planned.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Attempting to wean vent settings with PEEP of 9 and repeating ABG is planned.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 149 mEq/L. Increasing free water flushes is planned to correct this electrolyte imbalance.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is improving, likely pre-renal. Diuresis with IV lasix and 25g albumin as needed is planned.

5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, so daily checks are planned. Transfusing for Hct <21 or active bleeding is also planned.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including liver cirrhosis, who presented to the emergency department with acute-on-chronic liver failure and septic shock. The patient was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasopressor support. He underwent several procedures including paracentesis, central venous line placement, and arterial line placement. The patient also received nutritional support through a nasogastric tube.

The patient's vital signs have been stable with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 161/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His temperature has been within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance has been monitored closely, with a total input of 3,583 mL and total output of 2,295 mL. He has received an adequate amount of free water flushes to maintain hydration.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated bilirubin levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and decreased albumin levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits except for hypernatremia. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, icterus, and mild distension of the abdomen. His lungs are clear, and his extremities are warm and well-perfused.

   CXR [**6-3**]:  increased left sided  opacification
   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving, concern
   today for increasing WBC.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Working on decreasing  PEEP requirements [**1-27**] ascites, volume
   and multifocal PNA,  now with what appears to be worsening left sided
   process.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day, now restarting Vanco D1=
   [**6-4**]
   course)
   - Back on CMV. (D11 of intubation) , Will have to think about
   tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of focal
   obstruction.  Still with increasing WBC (following up Clx), s/p removal
   of the IJ on the left  which started after stopping Vancomycin and now
   with apparent worsening left sided infiltrate.
   - f/u cultures from all in dwelling lines, check urine, sputum and c.
   dif and paracentesis
   - recheck cultures (blood, urine, c. dif), if spikes would favor adding
   gram pos coverage. Notably sputum clx no organism on gram stain and
   paracentesis unimpressive.
   - Abx as above
   - change foley
   - Bronchoscopy for sampling
     > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Add back reglan for slowing stool output
   - Cont lactulose
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-5**] range)
   - Cont Gentle diuresis with albumin today, goal 500 cc negative.
   - follow electrolytes
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
    > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is
   stopping today). We will cont to follow.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis leading to encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient also had an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration. The patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU with multiorgan failure.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and temporal history consistent with an aspiration event. There is also evidence of enterobacter cloacae in the sputum. The patient's CT scan shows significant multifocal pneumonia without cavitation, which has improved over the last few days. However, the patient now has volume overload and renal failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient likely has a worsening multifocal pneumonia, but there is no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel obstruction. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and cultures from all in-dwelling lines, urine, sputum, and cefoperazone-disk test for difficile (CDIF) have been ordered.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, indicating renal failure. There is little urine output, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated. The patient's renal function is likely due to acute tubular necrosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving, concern
   today for increasing WBC.
   >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-27**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually improving,
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day
   course)
   - Cont PS and slow wean of PEEP. (D9 of intubation) , Will have to
   think about  tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction.  Will need to reculture for rising WBC, may not have fever
   given liver dysfunction.
   - remove the IJ on the left
   - cultures from all in dwelling lines, check urine, sputum and c. dif
   - d/w liver re: repeat paracentesis
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-31**])
   - recheck cultures (blood, urine, c. dif), if spikes would favor
     > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Cont lactulose
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-28**]) for 5 day course last day [**6-2**].
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-5**] range)
   - Cont Gentle diuresis with albumin today, goal 500 cc negative.
   - follow electrolytes
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
   > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is
   stopping today). We will cont to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory arrest and multi-organ failure. He has been slowly improving but faces several potential medical complications. These include aspiration and hypox respiratory failure, leukocytosis (worsening multifocal pneumonia), ileus, hypotension, renal failure, anemia, liver failure with esophageal varices, encephalopathy, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory Failure: The patient had a respiratory arrest and was intubated. He now has new bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration, and his condition requires high PEEP requirements. This suggests ongoing respiratory failure.

2. Leukocytosis (Worsening Multifocal Pneumonia): The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating a possible worsening of his multifocal pneumonia. He may need to reculture for rising WBC and consider changing antibiotics.

3. Ileus: The patient's CT scan showed evidence of ileus, which is a temporary stoppage of the normal forward movement of the contents through the intestines. He has been started on erythromycin to aid in motility.

4. Hypotension: The patient previously required two pressors to maintain blood pressure and was later weaned off. He"

   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving, concern
   today for increasing WBC.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Working on decreasing  PEEP requirements [**1-27**] ascites, volume
   and multifocal PNA,  now with what appears to be worsening left sided
   process.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day, now restarting Vanco D1=
   [**6-4**]
   course)
   - Back on CMV. (D11 of intubation) , Will have to think about
   tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of focal
   obstruction.  Still with increasing WBC (following up Clx), s/p removal
   of the IJ on the left  which started after stopping Vancomycin and now
   with apparent worsening left sided infiltrate.
   - f/u cultures from all in dwelling lines, check urine, sputum and c.
   dif and paracentesis
   - recheck cultures (blood, urine, c. dif), if spikes would favor adding
   gram pos coverage. Notably sputum clx no organism on gram stain and
   paracentesis unimpressive.
   - Abx as above
   - change foley
   - Bronchoscopy for sampling
     > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Add back reglan for slowing stool output
   - Cont lactulose
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-5**] range)
   - Cont Gentle diuresis with albumin today, goal 500 cc negative.
   - follow electrolytes
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
    > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is
   stopping today). We will cont to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse cirrhosis presenting to the ICU with respiratory arrest and multi-organ failure. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, volume overload, renal failure, and is at risk for further complications such as sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's increasing white blood cell count and worsening multi-locational pneumonia suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and recent gastrointestinal bleed may contribute to hepatic encephalopathy, which is evident by his altered mental status and confusion.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio indicate a risk for bleeding complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest acute kidney injury, possibly due to hypotension or toxic-metabolic factors.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event has resulted in new bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
6. Volume overload: The patient's fluid overload, as indicated by his increased central venous pressure and weight gain, may contribute to worsening respiratory distress and cardiac dysfunction.
7. Liver failure: The patient's worsening hepatic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, leading to transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes mucous plugging or worsening infiltrate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause, such as aspiration pneumonia, is not effectively treated.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still elevated at 148, indicating hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and other complications if not properly managed.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's BUN and creatinine levels indicate possible ARF. If not managed appropriately, this can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable but may require monitoring and potential transfusion for Hct <21 or"

- A bronchoscopy is planned to further evaluate the infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis.
- The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance of 500cc to -1 L, with diuresis using IV lasix and albumin as needed.
- Cultures have been sent, and c. diff tests will be repeated.
- Foley catheter needs to be changed, and a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) should be considered.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation and transferred to the MICU with multiorgan failure. 

The patient's current condition includes aspiration and hypox respiratory failure, bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration event on admission, growing out enterobacter cloacae in the sputum, and significant multifocal pneumonia without evidence of cavitation. The patient also has volume overload, ascites, and renal failure. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 33.9, elevated creatinine levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT/PTT/INR. The patient's blood culture showed an increased white blood cell count, but no microorganisms were seen on gram stain. 

The patient's medical issues include worsening multifocal pneumonia, volume overload, ileus, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and liver failure with esophageal varices. 

The patient's plan includes continued empiric coverage with vancomycin and meropenem targeted to MDR enterobacter, tracheostomy, re-addition of erythromycin for ileus, continued lactulose, gentle diuresis with albumin challenge, monitoring of electrolytes, and supportive therapy for coagulopathy. 

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiorgan failure and multiple complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and coagulopathy."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration after intubation. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with multi-organ failure. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration and hypox respiratory failure, as well as pneumonia (PNA) with multifocal involvement and no evidence of cavitation. He also has volume overload, ascites, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening multifocal PNA: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating a possible worsening of his pneumonia.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level and decreased urine output, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Illeus: The patient's bowel movements have become irregular, and there is a concern for a return of the previous ileus.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, toxic-metabolic factors, and sepsis.
5. Esophageal varices: The patient has a history of GI bleed from esophageal varices, which could re-occur.
6. Anemia: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving, concern
   today for increasing WBC.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  rowing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  Working on decreasing  PEEP requirements [**1-27**] ascites, volume
   and multifocal PNA,  now with what appears to be worsening left sided
   process.
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-18**] for Vancomycin now completed 14 day, now restarting Vanco D1=
   6/11course)
   - Back on CMV. (D11 of intubation) , Will have to think about
   tracheostomy if we have limited progress.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of focal
   obstruction.  Still with increasing WBC (following up Clx), s/p removal
   of the IJ on the left  which started after stopping Vancomycin and now
   with apparent worsening left sided infiltrate.
   - f/u cultures from all in dwelling lines, check urine, sputum and c.
   dif and paracentesis
   - recheck cultures (blood, urine, c. dif), if spikes would favor adding
   gram pos coverage. Notably sputum clx no organism on gram stain and
   paracentesis unimpressive.
   - Abx as above
   - change foley
     > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**Date range (1) 9269**] with
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9262**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM) seems to be doing well.
   - cont care as above
   - Add back reglan for slowing stool output
   - Cont lactulose
    > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-5**] range)
   - Cont Gentle diuresis with albumin today, goal 500 cc negative.
   - follow electrolytes
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
    > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.  Will likely take significant time for him
   to improve.
   > Thrombocytopenia: restart heparin, more likely to be Vanco (which is
   stopping today). We will cont to follow.

   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure.
    >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:   b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event  on admission growing
   out enterobacter cloacae in the sputum with CT [**5-26**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation which has improved over
   the last few days; now complicated by volume overload, ascites and
   renal failure.  On [**6-4**] had increasing left sided infilatre but no
   signif secretions on bronch [**6-4**]
   - Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 968**])  (D1 = [**5-26**] for Meropenem).
   Vancomycin:   (5/25
 [**6-2**]  Vancomycin, then restarted [**6-4**] for
   increasing WBC pending BAL results.
   - Back on CMV. (D12 of intubation) , He will likely need tracheostomy
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of focal
   obstruction.  Still with high  WBC (following up Clx. Notably the WBC
   increased after completing a recent course of Vanc   Vancomycin.
   - f/u cultures from all in dwelling lines, check urine, sputum and c.
   dif and paracentesis
   - Cont empiric Vanco. Meropenem targeted to MDR enterobacter as above
     > Illeus: Has improved (was significant from [**Date range (1) 9286**], responded to
   reglan and erythromycin).
   - cont care as above
   - Add back reglan for slowing stool output
   - Cont lactulose
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-30**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will cont  gentle
   diuresis today with lasix and albumin.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**7-5**] range)
   - Cont Gentle diuresis with albumin today, goal 500 cc negative.
   - follow electrolytes
   > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure.
   - cont to trend Hct.
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices:  GI bleed in mid [**2172-4-24**] ([**Doctor Last Name 4220**]).
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-31**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was admitted to the medical ICU due to respiratory arrest and hypox respiratory failure, as well as multiorgan failure. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, worsening multifocal pneumonia, volume overload, ascites, renal failure, leukocytosis, ileus, anemia, liver failure with esophageal varices, encephalopathy, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory arrest and hypox respiratory failure, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and worsening multifocal pneumonia. There is a risk of further progression of the infection or development of drug-resistant organisms.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, which can lead to worsening cardiac function and fluid accumulation in other parts of the body.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure with increasing serum creatinine levels. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function or the development of complications like acute tubular necrosis.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory"

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of back pain. The patient has a history of allergies to Haldol and Ativan, confusion/delirium as a side effect, and is currently on multiple medications including furosemide (Lasix), insulin, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate between 85-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80-142 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's weight is unchanged since admission at 103 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,370 mL with outputs totaling 5,750 mL resulting in a negative balance of 380 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 9 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 98%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals back pain, jaundice, and mild distension of the abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory arrest. He has been receiving IV lasix bolus followed by a drip to manage fluid overload, and has shown improvement in his renal function. His ileus has resolved with the use of reglan and erythromycin. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O. His blood gases indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 287. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate ranging from 83-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/58-142/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His neurological examination reveals left blown pupil but is otherwise unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and current use of mechanical ventilation indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular assessment of gas exchange will be necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a risk of acute renal failure due to fluid overload and underlying cir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory status, with stable oxygen saturation and adequate ventilation. His vital signs are within normal limits, and he is awake and alert, following commands. Physical examination reveals slight distension of the abdomen and decreased bowel sounds, but no other abnormalities. Laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. The patient's renal function has improved, and his glucose levels are well-controlled on an insulin drip.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. Although he is currently stable on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's initial lab results indicated signs of acute renal failure, but his renal function has since improved. Continued monitoring and management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels are necessary to prevent renal dysfunction.
3. Altered mental status: The patient experienced confusion and delirium initially but has since resolved. Monitoring for any changes in mental status or signs of hepatic encephalopathy is important.
4. Ileus: The patient had an ileus initially, but it has improved. Close monitoring for any signs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found apneic and intubated due to respiratory arrest, likely caused by aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been transferred to the MICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening chest x-ray indicates possible aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and respiratory failure.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which can be caused by factors such as hypoperfusion, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can occur due to dehydration or excessive sodium intake.
4. Anemia: The patient's stable hematocrit levels suggest anemia, which may be caused by chronic blood loss or decreased production of red blood cells.
5. Ileus: The patient's lack of bowel movement indicates ileus, which is a common complication after surgery or critical illness.
6. Mental status changes: The patient's encephalopathy requires careful monitoring and management, as it can fluctuate and lead to further complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and stable platelet count indicate co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration, underwent intubation, and is currently in the MICU. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia, in the setting of fluid overload. His current condition is improving. The treatment plan includes continuing meropenem for a total of 14 days, discontinuing vancomycin as no cultures are positive, aiming for negative 1 L of intake/output balance, diuresis with Lasix gtt and albumin, decreasing vent settings, considering extubation, attempting to diurese with Lasix gtt for acute renal failure (ARF), and decreasing free water flushes to 250 cc q6h for hypernatremia. Other concerns include anemia, ileus, mental status, ETOH cirrhosis, and coagulopathy. The patient is receiving IV PPI, lactulose, and antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration, leading to intubation and transfer to the MICU. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. He has multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, and is also experiencing fluid overload. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/57 to 135/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,521 mL and total output of 6,695 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,174 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, including dextrose 50% and heparin sodium as prophylaxis. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, normal creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated blood glucose level. 

The patient's neurological status has improved significantly today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been passing a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and has a respiratory support index (RSI) of 47. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/52 mmHg to 135/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and awake, with diffuse crackles in the chest and good air movement. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 25.5 K/uL and a high sodium level of 146 mEq/L. The patient's recent medical history includes ileus, altered mental status, and hypernatremia. The patient's current plan includes completing meropenem in 2 days, running slightly negative, and considering extubation today. If extubation fails, a tracheostomy may be needed. The patient's care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent extubation attempt may put him at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of symptoms such"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU.

The patient's current condition is improving overall, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis/Respiratory failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and respiratory failure. The worsening X-ray suggests fluid overload.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are within normal range, but close monitoring is required. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance to prevent further kidney damage.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be managed by starting D5W and adjusting free water flushes.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable, but it is important to monitor them daily. Transfusion may be necessary if the hematocrit falls below 21 or if there is active bleeding.

5. Ileus: The patient has had recent bowel movements, indicating improvement in the ileus. However, continued monitoring and management with lactulose may be necessary if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated and transferred to the MICU. The patient has been improving overall, with a worsening x-ray likely due to fluid overload. He has received bronchoscopy and is currently on antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem). The plan is to extubate the patient today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, now with worsening x-ray likely in the setting of fluid overload. This indicates a potential complication of sepsis and respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 0.9, which needs to be monitored. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance and discontinue calcium acetate.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, and if pending extubation fails, free water flushes will be increased.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, but daily monitoring is required. Transfusion for Hct <21 or active bleeding will be considered, along with IV PPI.
5. Ileus: The patient is now having stool, but lactulose will continue if"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, which has led to complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient presented today with apnea and respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated but has now been extubated.

The patient's current condition shows improvement overall. Cultures have been negative, and he has received treatment with vancomycin and meropenem. His goals include maintaining negative fluid balance, preventing aspiration, and continuing antibiotic therapy until [**6-9**].

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 0.9. Close monitoring of renal function is recommended, along with fluid restriction to negative 500 mL per day. Hypernatremia is present, and the patient requires free water administration and monitoring of electrolytes.

The patient's ileus has resolved with the passage of stool, and he is currently on a regimen of reglan and erythro. The nasogastric (NG) tube is still in place with lactulose and rifaximin.

The patient's mental status is multifactorial, including underlying liver dysfunction, ICU delirium, and metabolic abnormalities. Treatment includes continuing lactulose, treating pneumonia, and monitoring for improvement in mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia, leading to intubation and transfer to the MICU. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been receiving various medications including Haldol, Ativan, Vancomycin, Meropenem, Furosemide, and Heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 94/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia, and worsening x-ray due to fluid overload. It is important to monitor for signs of sepsis and respiratory distress.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Monitoring the trend of creatinine levels and maintaining negative fluid balance is crucial.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which needs to be managed with appropriate hydration and electrolyte balance.
4. Ileus: Although the patient is now having"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, resulting in encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He recently experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found today to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated but is now extubated.

The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis and respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with meropenem and has completed vancomycin. The goal is to maintain input/output negative 500 mL to 1 L, provide aspiration precautions, and consult a pulmonary toilet.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 0.9. Monitoring the creatinine trend is recommended, along with maintaining negative 500 mL to negative L output and administering prn lasix IV. Electrolytes should be checked in the afternoon.

Hypernatremia is present, and free water should be continued. Mental status is multifactorial, including underlying liver dysfunction, ICU delirium, and metabolic abnormalities. Lactulose should be continued, and pneumonia treatment should be administered. Medications such as Haldol or Zyprexa can be used as needed for mental status improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated and treated with antibiotics, but now he has been extubated. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been improving overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Respiratory Failure: The patient had pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, and was treated with antibiotics. Although the cultures are negative, there is still a risk of sepsis or respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and recent intubation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating a possible kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and measures should be taken to maintain adequate fluid balance and correct any electrolyte abnormalities.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can be dangerous. It is important to continue free water administration and monitor electrolyte levels regularly.
4. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing a slowed movement of the intestines, leading to decreased bowel sounds and distension. This can be managed with medications such as reglan and erythromycin. Continued monitoring and assessment of bowel activity are needed.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, leading to transfer to the MICU.

The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis/respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia, acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 0.8, hypernatremia, anemia, ileus, mental status changes, ETOH cirrhosis with associated complications, nausea, coagulopathy, and diabetes type II.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are necessary to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, resulting in transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). 

The patient is currently being managed for several conditions: 

1. Sepsis/Respiratory failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, for which meropenem antibiotics have been initiated. The patient is tolerating minimal oxygen supplementation and is goal-directed with an input/output negative balance of 500 mL.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is currently at 0.8 mg/dL, which is improving during diuresis.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated. A plan has been made to administer 1 L of D5W at 75 cc/hr and continue with free water flushes at 250 cc every 4 hours.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, and daily monitoring is recommended. Transfusion is planned for Hct less than 21 or active bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is also indicated.

5. Ileus: The patient is now passing stool, and the current regimen will"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation, leading to transfer to the MICU.

The patient is currently experiencing sepsis and respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. The patient is being treated with meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 0.8. The renal function will be monitored during diuresis. The patient's sodium levels were initially high but have now resolved after administration of D5W and free water flushes. The patient will continue with free water flushes at 250cc q4hrs.

The patient is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy, as evidenced by asterixis today. The management includes continuing lactulose, treating pneumonia, and monitoring liver function tests (LFTs). Consideration should be given to performing a paracentesis if the patient is febrile and diagnostic paracentesis is indicated.

The patient also has an ileus, but is now having stool. The current regimen of NG tube with lactulose will be continued. The patient's anemia is stable, with a hematocrit ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, who presented with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated and received treatment with vancomycin and meropenem. He was extubated on 6/7 and is now improving. Cultures are negative, and he continues on meropenem treatment until 6/9.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient may be at risk for developing additional or worsening pneumonia due to recent intubation and aspiration.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.9, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration and other complications. Free water administration and careful electrolyte management are required.
4. Ileus: The patient is experiencing a temporary cessation of bowel motility, leading to reduced stool passage. Continued use of reglan and erythro may help stimulate bowel function.
5. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits signs of hepatic encephalopathy and ICU delirium. Management involves uptitration of lactulose and rifaximin, treatment of pneumonia, and addressing metabolic abnormalities.

The patient was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia, intubated, and later extubated. The patient is currently on meropenem for multidrug-resistant (MDR) enterobacter infection, vancomycin, and erythromycin. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/50-135/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), with decreased creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, and albumin levels. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphorus (PO4), and low potassium (K+).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal gastropathy, and recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent intubation and was treated for multi-drug resistant (MDR) enterobacter pneumonia. He is now extubated and improving overall.

The patient's current medical issues include sepsis/respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure (ARF) with a serum creatinine level of 0.9, hypernatremia, ileus, mental status changes, and complications related to ETOH cirrhosis including encephalopathy and ascites.

The patient is receiving meropenem for MDR enterobacter pneumonia, Lasix for fluid balance management, prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he remains in the ICU for further management and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent aspiration pneumonia and underlying lung dysfunction put him at risk for respiratory failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy, along with recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration, leading to intubation and transfer to the MICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis/Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifocal pneumonia and is at risk for sepsis. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal impairment. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting diuretic therapy accordingly is important.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level, which has now resolved with D5W and free water flushes. Continuing free water flushes at regular intervals is crucial to maintain electrolyte balance.

4. Mental Status Changes: The patient exhibits asterixis today, indicating ongoing encephalopathy. Continuing lactulose therapy and treating pneumonia are essential for managing mental status changes.

5. ETOH Cirrhosis Complications: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices with recent UGIB. Monitoring liver function tests and considering paracentesis if the patient becomes febrile and"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of liver disease, who presented to the hospital with confusion, delirium, and disorientation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments including albumin, lasix, NPH (presumably NPH insulin), lactulose, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/80 to 131/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is also on respiratory support with an ABG showing a pH of 7.28.

The patient has a history of allergies to Haloperidol and Lorazepam. The patient's current medications include Furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hour, Lansoprazole (Prevacid), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows the patient's fluid balance, vital signs, and other relevant measurements.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, mild abdominal distention with a leaking paracentesis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hypernatremia, altered mental status, ascites, hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity. He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and management of the mechanical ventilation settings are necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be corrected carefully to avoid neurological complications.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status may deteriorate further if not managed properly. Frequent neurological assessments and addressing the underlying causes are essential.
4. Ascites: The patient's fluid accumulation in the abdomen can lead to complications such as infection or further respiratory compromise.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's poor skin condition increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a bleeding tendency, which needs to be managed appropriately to prevent hemorrhagic complications.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver function may continue to decline, leading to worsening encephalopathy and other complications.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing new infections, particularly ventilator-associated"

   Disposition :ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis, which led to encephalopathy, ascites, and portal gastropathy. Recently, the patient experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient was found to be apneic with respiratory arrest and likely aspiration after intubation. The patient was later extubated.
- The patient has multifocal pneumonia, most likely due to aspiration. The patient did not pass any other significant evaluation symptoms.
- The patient's input/output status shows ongoing diuresis with Lasix and albumin administration, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters.
- The patient is experiencing hypernatremia and requires free water administration.
- The patient has liver failure but has shown improvement in mental status. An endoscopic evaluation of varices is planned.
- The patient's coagulation status indicates an elevated INR and stable platelet count.
- The patient needs to be evaluated for possible transfer to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility.
- Additional issues mentioned in the ICU resident's note include the need for tube feeds once the patient's mental status improves, poor glycemic control requiring insulin administration, and various lines and prophylactic measures in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial respiratory arrest and likely aspiration"
