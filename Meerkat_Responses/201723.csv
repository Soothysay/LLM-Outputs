   Imaging: [**2-3**] TTE: Marked right ventricular dilation with moderate
   global hypokinesis. Evidence of right ventricular pressure overload.
   Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension which is likely
   underestimated.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-4-10**], the right
   ventricle is now markedly dilated and moderately hypokinetic.
   [**2-3**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-29**], there has been
   placement of an orogastric tube that extends well into the stomach.
   Large central catheter from the right IJ region extends to the region
   of the right atrium. Left IJ catheter extends to the mid to lower
   portion of the SVC.
     There is some increased opacification at the left base that could
   reflect some
   atelectasis or possibly even small effusion, though this could also
   represent an artifact.
   [**2-3**] CTA (Preliminary read): No acute PE. Large right ventricle. Small
   simple right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Patchy
   opacity in the left lung base concerning for infection. Fatty liver
   with perihepatic simple fluid. Large axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.
   [**2-3**] Head CT (Preliminary): No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   Microbiology: [**2-3**] Mini-BAL: GRAM STAIN: 2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):
   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Hypotension: Has been weaned off vasopressors since midnight, with
   MAPs now consistently in 60-70s. Hypotension and bradycardia responded
   well to glucagon overnight. In regards to etiologies, TTE revealed
   significant RV compromise, although LV function apparently intact.
   Troponins elevated around baseline level, but CK/MB flat. Random
   cortisol elevated, which argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   Afebrile, but has leukocytosis, possibly consistent with septic
   etiology-infectious workup unrevealing thus far. Also has taken
   Labetolol and Morphine, with potentially decreased renal clearance
   - Monitor, now slightly hypertensive (will try to take fluid off today
   with CVVHD)
   # Altered mental status: Patient intubated for obtundation. Currently
   on fentanyl, midazolam. Possible etiologies for initial decrease in
   alertness include uremia, accumulation of narcotics.
   - Continue intubation for airway protection
   - C/w CVVH for uremia/acidosis
   - Can not rule out pneumonia and ground glass opacities on CT
   suggestive of possible atypicals. Continue Vanc/Flagyl/Cefepime and
   start Levofloxacin for atypicals
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic acidosis: Patient has known
   Stage IV CKD, [**1-13**] DM/Htn. HD catheter placed yesterday, prior to
   decompensation. pH improving from 7.08 -> 7.31. Lactate slowly
   uptrending.
   - C/w CVVH for metabolic abnormalities, acid/base status
 and volume
   removal
   - C/w prismasate dialysate fluid, with elevated HCO3 content
   - Monitor lactates with blood gases
   - F/u renal recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:Infectious workup unrevealing. Abrupt rise may be
   related to neupogen therapy.
   - Can not rule out pneumonia and ground glass opacities on CT
   suggestive of possible atypicals. Start Levofloxacin for atypicals
    - F/u outstanding culture data
    - C/w empiric ABx tx with Vanc / Cefepime / Flagyl, as well as empiric
   PO Vancomycin for C.diff
   # Sinus Bradycardia: Could be related to Atenolol given 65% clearance
   from kidneys and was taking 800 mg po TID until the day of transfer.
   Responded quite well to glucagon 5mg IV X1 yesterday
   - Continue to monitor
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overloaded on exam (LE edema, JVD,
   audible crackles). Has known elevated PA systolic HTN secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction proven on R heart cath 6/[**2193**]. Most recently may
   simply be [**1-13**] to worsened renal failure. TTE with significant LV
   dysfunction, as above. Cardiac enzymes worsening although EKG this
   morning not significant changed from baseline
   - Guaiac stools and transfuse one pRBC for cardiac disease and Hct<30
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes until they peak and then continue heparin gtt
   48 hours beyond
   - Already on heparin gtt for ?PE on CTA (prelim read still)
   - Continue aspirin and will start statin today
   - Likely still has beta blockade on board from Atenolol, after glucagon
   treatment. Will consider short acting, low dose beta blocker tomorrow
   - Will add LFTs to AM labs for possible initiation of statin
   - Cardiology still following patient, as she was transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 383**]
   3 service. Will touch base with them this morning, including possible
   cardiac catheterization
   - Consider Swan Ganz catheterization for pulmonary hypertension and
   cardiac pressures
   - Fluid managment by CVVH
   # Chronic pruritic rash: Developed in the past half a year per recent
   discharge summary and thought to be due to drug reaction.
    - Clarify with primary team whether Dermatology was consulted
    - Sarna PRN once more alert
   # Diabetes: At home regimen on Glargine 22u at bedtime.  This was
   continued inpatient.  Now will be NPO s/p intubation.
    - Will increase humalog sliding scale and see what patient requires
   for tailored glargine dose tomorrow
    - OG/NG tube, start Glucose / Renal TF
   # Depression.  Unclear level of control.
   - Hold Fluoxetine while NPO
   - Restart in AM via OG
   # Fractured R humerus: Seen by Ortho inpatient.  NWB.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted with increasing lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain, consistent with an acute on chronic exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient became anuric and then developed hypotension, bradycardia, and worsened metabolic acidosis/uremia, prompting transfer to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has responded well to glucagon and she has been weaned off vasopressors. However, she is now slightly hypertensive, so monitoring and attempts to remove fluid with CVVHD are necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient was intubated for obtundation and is currently on fentanyl and midazolam. Possible etiologies for the initial decrease in alertness include uremia and accumulation of narcotics. Intubation will continue for airway protection, CVVH for uremia/acidosis, and Levofloxacin for atypical pneumonia.

3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has known Stage IV CKD and DM/Htn. Her pH has improved from 7.08 to 7.31. Lactate levels are"

   Imaging: [**2-3**] TTE: Marked right ventricular dilation with moderate
   global hypokinesis. Evidence of right ventricular pressure overload.
   Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension which is likely
   underestimated.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-4-10**], the right
   ventricle is now markedly dilated and moderately hypokinetic.
   [**2-3**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-29**], there has been
   placement of an orogastric tube that extends well into the stomach.
   Large central catheter from the right IJ region extends to the region
   of the right atrium. Left IJ catheter extends to the mid to lower
   portion of the SVC.
     There is some increased opacification at the left base that could
   reflect some
   atelectasis or possibly even small effusion, though this could also
   represent an artifact.
   [**2-3**] CTA (Preliminary read): No acute PE. Large right ventricle. Small
   simple right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Patchy
   opacity in the left lung base concerning for infection. Fatty liver
   with perihepatic simple fluid. Large axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.

   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Hypotension: Has been weaned off vasopressors since midnight, with
   MAPs now consistently in 60-70s. In regards to etiologies, TTE revealed
   significant RV compromise, although LV function apparently intact.
   Troponins elevated around baseline level, but CK/MB flat. Random
   cortisol elevated, which argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   Afebrile, but has leukocytosis, possibly consistent with septic

   PO Vancomycin for C.diff
   # Sinus Bradycardia: Could be related to Atenolol given 65% clearance
   from kidneys and was taking 800 mg po TID until the day of transfer.
    - Trial glucacon 5mg IV x 1
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overloaded on exam (LE edema, JVD,

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, and a fractured right humerus. She was admitted with increasing lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain consistent with an acute exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic heart failure. The patient initially responded to diuretic therapy but then became anuric on the second day. She became increasingly obtunded with new-onset hypopnea, hypotension, and worsened metabolic acidosis/uremia, prompting transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, altered mental status, acute on chronic kidney injury/metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, sinus bradycardia, congestive heart failure, and a chronic pruritic rash. She is intubated for airway protection and on fentanyl and midazolam sedation. The patient has been weaned off vasopressors since midnight, with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) now consistently in the 60-70s.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in organ damage.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to"

   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Hypertension: Now with systolic pressures in 170-190s. Off pressors x
   24 hrs. Labetalol toxicity from prolonged clearance in setting of renal
   failure a possible exacerbating factor of initial hypotension, now
   requiring boluses of anti-hypertensives (lopressor, hydralazine). 4+

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted for increasing lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain consistent with an acute exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF. The patient became anuric on [**2-2**] and later developed hypotension, worsening metabolic acidosis/uremia, and obtundation. She was transferred to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's systolic pressures are in the 170-190s, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This requires continuous monitoring and management with antihypertensive medications.

2. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has known Stage IV CKD and DM/Htn. She is experiencing worsening renal function and metabolic acidosis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated to manage the metabolic abnormalities, acid/base status, and volume removal.

4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of volume overload with symptoms of congest"

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Respiratory status: Stable off ventilator x 24 hrs. CXR with possible
   airspace consolidation, but BAL culture with only small amounts
   commensal flora. Not coughing, afebrile, and leukocytosis trending
   downwards. CT chest reported as having bilateral large axillary lymph
   nodes that may require repeat scan after resolution of acute issues.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient underwent initial diuresis with Lasix but then became anuric on [**2-2**]. On [**2-3**], the patient became increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension, and worsened metabolic acidosis/uremia prompting transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient is currently off ventilator for 24 hours and has a stable respiratory status. A chest X-ray showed possible airspace consolidation, but a bronchoalveolar lavage culture only showed small amounts of commensal flora. The patient is not coughing, afebrile, and leukocytosis is trending downwards. A CT chest revealed bilateral large axillary lymph nodes that may require repeat scan after resolution of acute issues. The patient is being continued on vancomycin, Flagyl, and cefepime for a 4-day course (completed with today's dose). 

The patient's altered mental status is emotionally labile immediately post-extubation but is now significantly clearer and oriented. A social work consult has been placed for patient/family coping."
