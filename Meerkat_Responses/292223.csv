   represent
   aspiration/atelectasis/infection. small R> L pleural effusions is
   increased.

   cyst.
   assessment of solid viscera lmtd w/o IV contrast. gallbladder distended
   with
   stone, ?sludge, wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, suggesting
   cholecystitis.. no definite biliary dilatation seen (limited
   assessment). no
   free air/fluid. colonic diverticulosis w/o diverticulitis. no bowel
   obstruction
   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   #) Hypotension:  Much improved today and has not required any pressors
   since the peri-intubation period.  Her initial presentation was
   concerning for sepsis vs cardiac cause. Possible etiologies of sepsis
   would include gallbladder, although no evidence of ductal dilatation on
   US or CT, so cholangitis doesn
t seem to have be at play.  UA  not
   revealing for a source.  She had been on ciprofloxacin and
   metronidazole but may have been harboring a resistant microbe that is
   now being covered adequately by  pip-tazo and vancomycin.  Cardiac
   cause is also possible given evidence of NSTEMI (as below), although
   elevated WBC and bandemia point away from this as a primary event.
   Medication effect is likely also at play, as she was beta blocked at
   the time of the trigger.
   - check venous O2 Sat
   - discuss with surgery whether a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be
   helpful
   - f/u final read CT torso
   - continue vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage for now
   - f/u cultures
   - pursue cardiac work-up, as below
   .
   #) Cholecystitis:  Has been medically managed on the surgical team
   prior to transfer.  Appears worse on last night
s CT compared to
   admission.  No evidence of ductal dilatation.
   - discuss with the surgical team the possibility of percutaneous
   cholecystostomy (need to clarify with them that her ongoing cardiac
   issues should not preclude surgical or IR-guided intervention if other
   wise indicated)
   - continue antibiotics as above
   .
   #) NSTEMI:  Cardiac enzymes continuing to rise, now with troponin .91
   and positive MB index. She likely has had cardiac ischemia in the
   setting of sepsis-induced catecholamine surger.  She does have a known
   history of CAD.  It is unclear if an element of cardiac failure,
   possibly secondary to ischemia, may have contributed to her hypotension
   and hypoxia.   After discussion with cardiology, there are no plans for
   heparinization currently (in part because operative management of
   cholecycstitis was being considered) but may want to re-consider this
   if there are no plans for procedure.
   - trend enzymes
   - obtain OSH echo
   - repeat echo with attention to any new wall motion abnormalities
   - discuss with cardiology heparinization
   - no plans for catheterization currently
   - continue aspirin
   - increase statin to atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - restart low-dose beta blocker, as BP has been fine since intubation.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated yesterday secondary to intermittent
   hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and need to protect airway for
   line placement.  Differential for cause includes aspiration, CHF,
   pulmonary infection.  Lung CT does show bibasilar consolidation.  Most
   recent ABG shows hyperventilation, and her O2 Sats and PaO2 overnight
   have been excellent.
   - f/u BNP
   - repeat echo, as above
   - decrease RR to improve respiratory alkalosis
   - f/u I/O, consider gentle diuresis to minimize pulmonary edema prior
   to trial of extubation
   - continue nebulizers given asthma history
   - consider extubation later today
   ..
   #) Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to poor renal perfusion in
   the setting of hypotension.   Improving today, as is urine output.
   Urine lytes have still not been sent
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   #) Pericardial cyst:  seen on CT incidentally.   Cardiology aware.
   - re-evaluate on TTE
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, would consider TF if not extubated promptly

   Code status:  full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

1. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation.
2. They have been placed on arterial line monitoring and multi-lumen central venous access.
3. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but require close monitoring.
4. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted events.
5. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, troponin levels, and liver enzymes.
6. Imaging studies reveal a possible pneumonia, small pleural effusion, and a pericardial cyst.
7. The patient is being treated for multiple conditions, including myocardial infarction, cholecystitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure.
8. Treatment plans include continuing antibiotics, pursuing cardiac work-up, discussing the possibility of percutaneous cholecystostomy, and considering extubation later today.
9. The patient's code status is set to full code, and their disposition is in the ICU for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of septic shock: The patient's initial presentation was concerning for sepsis, and they have been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Complications related to myocard"

   concerning for sepsis vs cardiac cause. Possible etiologies of sepsis
   would include gallbladder, although no evidence of ductal dilatation on
   US or CT, so cholangitis is unlikely.  UA unremarkable.  Cardiac cause
   is also possible, and perhaps more likely given the absence of fever or
   positive blood cultures.   Cardiology iniitially did not want to
   heparinize given the possibility of surgery
   - hold beta blocker
   - f/u final read CT torso
   - continue vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage for now
   - f/u cultures
   - discuss with cardiology
   #) Respiratory failure. Clear chest x-ray, unclear precipitant of
   hypoxia. Differential includes aspiration (yet to blossom on CXR),
   acute MI with heart failure (troponins are low, see below, and CXR not
   demonstrating pulmonary edema), pulmonary embolism (although had been
   on DVT prophylaxis). Heart failure less likely, and physical
   exam/pressures on vent not consistent with asthma exacerbation.
   - Downtitrate FiO2 and PEEP to minimal doses; follow ABG
   - Ventilate at 8cc/kg, increase rate as appropriate
   - Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI's given history of asthma
   - add-on BNP
   .
   #) Anuria/acute renal failure. Likely pre-renal (vs. ATN) secondary to
   hypotension vs. other intrinsic renal process
   - Await urinalysis and culture
   - Urine electrolytes
   #) Elevated troponin:  continuing to rise, now with troponin .91 and
   positive MB index. This may still be troponin leak in the setting of
   hypotension.   Total CK is not remarkably elevated.  which may
   represent troponin leak in setting of sepsis vs. NSTEMI (but CK's not
   remarkably elevated, likely indicating very small amount of cardiac
   muscle damage). Has known history of pulmonary hypertension, so likely
   has echocardiograms from OSH.
   - Attempt to obtain outside echo reports ([**Hospital3 1492**])
   - Trend enzymes, although they appear to have peaked
   - Hold on heparin/integrilin for now
   - Statin, aspirin, consider beta blocker if hemodynamically stable (was
   on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **])
   #) Abnormal LFTs:  bilirubin elevated on admission, now resolved, but
   alk phos is now slightly abnormal.  Repeat CT with likely
   cholecystitis.  Per surgery will need percutaneous drainiage.
   #) Coronary artery disease/Hyperlipidemia. Continue aspirin and statin.
   #) F/E/N. No IVF for now, monitor/replete electrolytes. NPO as diet;
   consider addition of tube feeds if no plans for immediate extubation.
   #) Prophylaxis. H2 blocker. Heparin SubQ. Bowel regimen PRN.
   #) Communication. With daughters, phone numbers in chart. ICU consent
   signed.
   #) Access. RIJ, A-line.
   #) Code Status. Full code.
   #) Dispo. Pending clinical improvement.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates that they are in the ICU with several medical complications. The note mentions the patient's condition as follows:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient has an elevated troponin level, which suggests cardiac muscle damage. However, the total CK is not remarkably elevated, indicating a small amount of cardiac damage. The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension is also noted.

2. Shock, Septic: The patient presented with hypotension and tachycardia, which were concerning for sepsis. Possible etiologies include the gallbladder, although there is no evidence of ductal dilatation on ultrasound or CT. Cholangitis is unlikely. The absence of fever or positive blood cultures makes a cardiac cause more likely.

3. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with unclear precipitants of hypoxia. Differential includes aspiration (yet to blossom on CXR), acute MI with heart failure, and pulmonary embolism.

4. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's presentation suggests severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and potential organ dysfunction.

5. Anuria/Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing pre-renal acute renal failure secondary to hypotension or another intrinsic renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of myocardial infarction, septic shock, pneumonia due to aspiration, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's current condition shows a fever of 101.1°F, with a lightened sedation for spontaneous breathing trials and extubation attempted this morning. The patient is on multiple medications including heparin sodium, propofol, lansoprazole, furosemide, and others. Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 98.7°F, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 116/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 5.8 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) at 71%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,393 mL, output of 1,608 mL, and a positive balance of 785 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 202. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.22 ng/mL, and other abnormalities in kidney function tests and electrolytes. Imaging shows an in situ jugular venous catheter, nasogastric tube, and endotracheal tube in place. The patient has been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction, septic shock, pneumonia due to aspiration, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Potential complications that can arise include further deterioration of organ function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator weaning failure."

   hyperdense on a contrast-enhanced study (and therefore possibly
   enhancing). The structure appears quite hyperdense on the prior exam of
   [**5-22**]. The etiology is unclear. There is no upstream duodenal dilation
   to suggest obstruction. The differential diagnosis includes atypical
   food particles/debris (if not truly enhancing), polyp (if enhancing)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a significant cardiac history. She was admitted with suspected cholecystitis and transferred to the ICU for sepsis/MI. The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure but is doing well and is expected to be extubated today. She has polymicrobial bacteremia and is being treated with Vanc/Zosyn. The patient's cholecystitis appears worse on the last night's CT compared to admission. There is no evidence of ductal dilatation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be discussed with the surgical team. The patient is also being treated for NSTEMI, acute renal failure, and is on systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. Her glycemic control is being monitored, and she is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxia and airway protection. There is a risk of complications related to mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, or barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia and is being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of septic shock, organ dysfunction, and potential need for additional interventions such as source control or hemodynamic support.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis appears"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a significant cardiac history, admitted with cholecystitis and transferred to the ICU for sepsis and myocardial infarction. She remains hemodynamically stable but has not optimized respiratory status. The patient is intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. The barriers to extubation include fluid overload, sedation, and high respiratory system resistance index (RSBI). She has blood cultures positive for Gram-positive rods consistent with Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium species. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated overnight due to hypoxia and airway protection. Barriers to extubation include fluid overload, sedation, and high RSBI. 
- Stop IV fluid administration
- Administer 20mg IV lasix once
- Reassess spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this afternoon and attempt extubation
- Continue using mechanical ventilatory support devices

2. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient has blood cultures positive for GPCs and GPRs (likely contaminant). She is hemodynamically stable and not requiring vasopressors. Her vancomycin trough level is 3.6, indicating she is underdosed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a significant cardiac history who was admitted with cholecystitis and transferred to the ICU for sepsis and myocardial infarction (MI). The patient has now been extubated and is showing improvement.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient still has some degree of fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory distress. The goal is to aim for volume net even to negative, continue MDIs, and wean O2 as tolerated.

2. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient has blood cultures positive for GPCs and GPRs, with a possible contaminant GPR and possibly enterococcus from a biliary source. She is currently stable and not requiring pressors, receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. It is recommended to continue Vanc at 1g IV q24, continue Zosyn, and follow up with blood cultures including sensitivities.

3. Cholecystitis: The patient continues to be medically managed by a comanaging surgical team. The alkaline phosphatase level is mildly elevated without an increase in biliary levels. It is advised to continue antibiotics as above and monitor the situation.

4. NSTEMI: The patient suffered non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) while septic, with troponins peaking and trending"
