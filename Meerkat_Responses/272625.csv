   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE), bilateral chronic lymphedema, and multiple ulcers. He was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and sepsis and underwent below-knee amputation (BKA) three days ago. The patient is now being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis complicated by sepsis post BKA: The patient's improving hemodynamics and resolution of leukocytosis indicate that the infection is responding to antibiotics. However, close monitoring and continuation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a component of sepsis and surgical blood loss. The stable mean arterial pressure (MAP) after discontinuation of phenylephrine suggests improvement, but maintaining MAP at 65 with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pressors, if necessary, should be continued.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K administration. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are equivocal, so further evaluation with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and FSP is recommended. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or clotting and considering heparin therapy are necessary.
4. Hypercarbia/Hypoxia: The patient did well on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic venous insufficiency, and bilateral chronic lymphedema who was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and sepsis. He underwent below-knee amputation three days ago and is now being managed in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to his unstable condition. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula with CPAP. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the below-mentioned notes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be a result of sepsis and surgical blood loss. The MAP is stable after discontinuation of phenylephrine. It is important to keep the MAP above 65 mmHg with IV fluids and pressors if necessary.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient shows signs of coagulopathy, which has improved with vitamin K administration. DIC labs are equivocal, and further evaluation is needed with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and FSP levels. Heparin subcutaneous injections should be monitored.
3. Hypercarbia/Hypoxia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55M with COPD/CO2 retainer, VTE,  bilateral chronic
   lymphedema and multiple ulcers who was admited for LE cellulitis/sepsis
   and who underwent BKA three days ago is transferred to MICU for medical
   management
   # Cellulitis c/b sepsis s/p BKA: Improving hemodynamics and
   leukocytosis resolved. Continuing ABX (vanc and cefephime, both started
   on [**2115-6-29**]).
   - continue abx (14 days, d1 [**2115-6-29**])
   - CIS
   # Hypotension: Component of sepsis and surgical blood loss. Stable MAP
   after discontinuation of phenylephrine.
   - Keep MAP 65 with IVF and pressors if necessary.
   # Coagulopathy: Improved with vit K. DIC labs equivocal.
   - fibrinogen, ddimer, FSP to eval DIC
   - heparin SQ [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor
   # Hypercarbia/Hypoxia: did well on CPAP. Sats stable in 90s.
   - h/o COPD: nebs, will consider steroids if deteriorates
   - h/o CHF: ECHO today, volume ovrload s/p resuscitation at surgery; prn
   lasix but now is autodiuresing
   - CPAP
   # Sedation: Possibilities include recent use of propofol during
   intubation and obesity. Also COPD with h/o CO2 retain.
   - monitor CO2 status and pH and may need reintubation if CO2 continues
   to rise or if worsened mentation.
   - nebs and deep suction
   # BKA:  absent of signs of infection but does have deep ulcers on left
   heel and left leg.
   - Will discuss with vascular
   FEN: tube feeds stopped post extubation, now NPO for aspiration risk.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with COPD and chronic lymphedema, who was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and sepsis, and subsequently underwent below-knee amputation. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for medical management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 mmHg to 114/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and a sinus rhythm heart rhythm. His height is recorded as 68 inches.

The patient has been on invasive ventilation support since 08:51 AM, but it was stopped at an unknown time. He was changed to CPAP overnight, with SpO2 levels in the 90s. His svo2 is 69.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, doxycycline, and codeine. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 07:54 PM on 07/01/2115, and cefepime at 10:00 PM on the same day. He is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis, ranitidine for prophylaxis, and furosemide (Lasix) at 06:28 AM on 07/02/2115.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, chronic extremity ulcer, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF) and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). The patient presented with sepsis from right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis, likely osteomyelitis, and subsequently underwent below-knee amputation (BKA). The patient is now being transferred to the medical team for further management in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis from RLE cellulitis, which is a serious complication of infection. This condition requires prompt medical attention and treatment.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient's RLE cellulitis is likely secondary to osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone. This condition can lead to further complications if not appropriately managed.
3. Diabetic Foot Ulcer: The patient has a history of chronic extremity ulcer, indicating a potential risk for diabetic foot ulcers. These ulcers can become infected and may require amputation in severe cases.
4. CHF: The patient has a possible diagnosis of CHF, which is a condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. If left untreated, it can lead to further complications such as fluid"

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is probably normal (LVEF~55%). Right ventricular free

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE), bilateral chronic lymphedema, and multiple ulcers. He was admitted for lower extremity (LE) cellulitis and sepsis and underwent below-knee amputation (BKA) three days ago. He is now transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for medical management.
- The patient has been improving, with resolved leukocytosis and improving hemodynamics.
- The patient has ongoing antibiotic therapy (ABX) for cellulitis and sepsis, which will continue for another 14 days starting from June 29th.
- The patient's hypotension and coagulopathy have resolved, but he needs to restart home warfarin due to his history of VTE.
- The patient's hypercarbia and hypoxia were managed with CPAP, and his oxygen saturation stabilized in the 90s. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for which nebulizers will be considered if he deteriorates. There are concerns about possible congestive heart failure (CHF), and an echocardiogram (echo) has been performed to assess for volume overload. Lasix will be given as needed, but the patient is currently autodiuresing.
- The patient's sedation has improved, and he is more alert and oriented.
- The right BKA site is currently unremarkable without signs of infection, and vascular follow-up is planned.
- The left leg has a grade 4 ulcer, likely predisposed by diabetes. Vascular will be following this, and the patient will be monitored for signs of infection. Wound care and position changes will be implemented, with follow-up from vascular services. Placement of a wound vac may be considered at a rehabilitation facility.
- The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and peripheral lines. He is on prophylaxis for stress ulcers and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is planned for the floor and then rehabilitation or directly to rehabilitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection at the BKA site: The patient's left leg has a grade 4 ulcer, and there is a risk of infection at the surgical site.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has COPD and is a CO2 retainer, which may lead to respiratory acidosis. There is also a risk of VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of VTE and is currently on prophylactic heparin. However, there is still a risk of thromboembolic events, especially if he is immobile or develops deep vein thrombosis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's echo shows evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, which may indicate underlying heart failure. There is also a concern for CHF, especially if the patient's fluid status is not appropriately managed.
5. Poor wound healing: The patient's chronic lymphedema and diabetes may impair wound healing, particularly at the site of the grade 4 ulcer in his left leg."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic extremity ulcer. He was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. Upon admission, his vital signs were stable, but he had a low oxygen saturation level of 89%. He required CPAP support overnight and his CO2 levels were increased to 70.

The patient has been receiving multiple IV medications including ranitidine for prophylaxis, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, fentanyl for pain management, and furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management. He also receives methadone from an outside clinic, but there were issues contacting them for further information.

The patient's echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. There were no signs of aortic regurgitation (AR) or aortic stenosis (AS), and only trivial mitral regurgitation (MR) was noted.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and cefepime, but there is no clear indication of an infection or the source of infection. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as elevated D-d"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE), bilateral chronic lymphedema, and multiple ulcers. He was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis/sepsis and underwent below-knee amputation (BKA) three days ago. The patient is now transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis complicated by sepsis post BKA: The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and he is improving hemodynamically. Continuing antibiotics (vanc and cefepime) for 14 days starting from [**2115-6-29**].
2. Hypotension: Resolved.
3. Coagulopathy: Improved with vitamin K. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) labs are equivocal. Fibrinogen, D-dimer, and FSP should be evaluated for DIC. Administer heparin subcutaneously and monitor.
4. Hypercarbia/Hypoxia: The patient did well on CPAP. Oxygen saturation is stable in the 90s. Consider nebulizers and steroids if there is deterioration. Monitor CO2 status and pH and may need reintubation if CO2 continues to rise or worsened mentation.
5. Sedation: Possibilities include recent use of propofol during intubation and obesity. Also, COPD with a history of CO2 retention. Monitor CO2 status and pH and may need reintubation if CO2 continues to rise or if worsened mentation.
6. BKA: Absent of signs of infection but has deep ulcers on the left heel and left leg. Discuss with vascular.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented with right lower extremity (RLE) gangrene and sepsis, underwent below-knee amputation (BKA), and is now showing improvement. The patient's current chief complaint is sepsis, which has significantly improved. He has several medical allergies, including penicillins, doxycycline, and codeine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/67 to 147/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving various medications and infusions, including antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, fentanyl for pain control, and furosemide for fluid management. The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated blood glucose and D-dimer levels. The patient's imaging studies are negative for any new findings. The patient's assessment includes impaired aerobic capacity, balance, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation.
