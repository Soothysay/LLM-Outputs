   rupture presenting with abd pain, recurrent bladder rupture and
   hypotension.
   # Bladder rupture: Patient currently in lots of abdominal pain, worse
   than the previous night.  This is consistent with worsening peritonitis
   from his bladder rupture.  The etiology of the rupture remains
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has friable tissue from previous XRT and has had a rupture
   before.  A recent foley trauma may have also caused the acute bladder
   rupture.  At this point he likely has urosepsis which has a difficult
   to treat source, that being the peritoneum.  Patient currently on
   Vancomycin, cefepime and gentamycin.  Urology is closely involved and
   overall plan is to go to OR today.  Family aware of overnight events.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, who underwent radiation therapy (XRT) and previously experienced a bladder rupture. He presented with abdominal pain, recurrent bladder rupture, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU, experiencing worsening peritonitis from the bladder rupture. The etiology of the rupture is unclear, but it may be due to previous XRT, a recent Foley trauma, or other factors. The patient has urosepsis with a difficult-to-treat source in the peritoneum. He is being treated with Vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin, and the urology team is closely involved. The overall plan is to take the patient to the operating room (OR) today. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. He also has evidence of poor peripheral circulation in the right 2nd/3rd toes with dry gangrene. His laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's glucose level is also elevated. The assessment includes tachycardia, hypotension, recurrent bladder rupture, urosepsis, and possible complications related to his underlying medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to urosepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) from hypoper"

   87 yo male with h/o prostate CA and with chronic and indwelling foley
   now admitted with hematuria and sepsis with bladder rupture found on
   initial CT scan done for severe abdominal pain.  He has had initial
   goal directed therapy for sepsis with reasonable response to support
   across the night and decrese in pressors required but with persistent
   tachycardia, continued elevation in WBC count, increased in lactate and
   now with plans for operative intervention this am.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Continue broad spectrum ABX-_vanco/cefepime/gent
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -CvO2 adequate across the night, HCT-31
   -Will expect improvement with resolution of leak and drainage of leak
   into peritoneal space
   2)Baldder Rupture-
   -To OR this morning for repair
   -Will maintain urology recs post operatively
   -[**Month (only) 60**] well be reasonable to maintain intubation post operatively given
   brisk progression of sepsis and likely large volume needed

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer and chronic indwelling Foley catheter, admitted with hematuria and sepsis. The patient was found to have a bladder rupture on initial CT scan done for severe abdominal pain. He has received initial goal-directed therapy for sepsis with reasonable response to support across the night, decreasing the need for pressors but with persistent tachycardia, continued elevation in WBC count, increased lactate levels, and plans for operative intervention this morning.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Bladder Rupture: The patient has a confirmed bladder rupture, which is a serious surgical emergency. If not promptly repaired, it can lead to further complications such as urinary leakage into the abdominal cavity, infection, and organ damage.

3. Postoperative Complications: Given the patient's age and underlying health conditions, there is a risk of postoperative complications after the planned surgical repair of the bladder rupture. These can include bleeding, infection, respiratory complications, cardiac events, and delirium.

4. Chronic Kidney Injury: The prolonged use of Foley catheter and subsequent bladder rupture may have caused acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney injury if not managed appropriately.

5. Pneumonia: The patient's nasally intubated and immobilized state increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Adequate lung hygiene and early mobilization should be prioritized to prevent this complication.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be implemented to reduce the risk of DVT.

7. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: Critical illness can increase gastric acid production, leading to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be used for stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent this complication.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, manage sepsis appropriately, perform timely surgical intervention for bladder rupture, and prevent other potential complications to optimize the patient's outcome."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who has undergone radiation therapy (XRT) and previously experienced a bladder rupture. The patient presented with abdominal pain and was found to have recurrent bladder rupture and hypotension. He underwent surgical closure of the anterior bladder perforation, but the posterior perforation was left open with a drain.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis, peritonitis, hypotension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient is still septic from peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight with decreasing white blood cell count. He has Gram-negative rods (GNR) in both urine and peritoneal fluid, with culture sensitivities still pending. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to the presence of GNR in both urine and peritoneal fluid. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation should be administered as needed.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels and low urine output indicate potential renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who underwent radiation therapy (XRT) and experienced a prior bladder rupture. He presented with abdominal pain, recurrent bladder rupture, and hypotension. The anterior bladder wall perforation was closed, but the posterior perforation was left open with a drain. The cause of the rupture remains unclear, possibly due to trauma from a Foley catheter or previous XRT. The patient is likely still septic from peritonitis/bladder rupture, despite being afebrile overnight with decreasing white blood cell count. Gram-negative rods (GNR) were found in both urine and peritoneal fluid, with culture sensitivities pending. The patient is currently on Vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. Further surgical plans are pending, and antibiotic therapy may be adjusted based on culture results. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are unstable, requiring careful fluid management and pain control. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and depression. The patient is being fed through an enteral route and is being closely monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who presented with recurrent bladder rupture and peritonitis, now in the ICU for sepsis following partial repair of the bladder. The patient has shown some improvement in physiology with the use of intravenous fluids (IVF) and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection. The patient's response to IVF suggests that there may still be low filling pressures, indicating the need for continued monitoring and management of sepsis.

2. Bladder Rupture: The patient has a recurrent bladder rupture, and it is important to maintain drainage to prevent further complications. The plan includes working with urology to determine the timing for re-exploration.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular beating. It is mentioned that there are several issues that would not favor attempting conversion to a normal heart rhythm. Therefore, the patient will continue with pain control and Diltiazem as needed for heart rate control.

4. Pain management: The patient's pain needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent discomfort and potential complications.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient should be on"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer and recurrent bladder rupture, now presenting with sepsis and peritonitis. He underwent surgery yesterday and received fluids overnight due to low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels, which improved. Most of his urine output came from the Jackson-Pratt drain. 

The patient has allergies to amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin, oxycodone, megestrol acetate, Ritalin, and Remeron. His last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 06/04/2176 at 01:48 PM, gentamicin on 06/05/2176 at 04:00 AM, and vancomycin on 06/05/2176 at 08:15 AM. 

His vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/54 to 143/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation as his heart rhythm. 

His flow sheet data shows a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg, cardiac output of 13.7 L/min, stroke volume index of 7.7 L/min/m^2, mixed venous oxygen saturation of 87%, and fluid balance with a total input of 16,308 mL and a total output of 14,408 mL. 

His physical examination revealed well-nourished appearance, tachycardia, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, clear breath sounds, absent peripheral pulses, and cool extremities. Neurologic examination showed the patient to be attentive, oriented, and able to follow simple commands. 

Laboratory results indicated a white blood cell count of 19.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 222 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 112 to 129 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. Other lab values were within normal limits. 

Imaging revealed no abnormalities on chest X-ray, while microbiology showed Gram-negative rods and polymorphonuclear leukocytes on gram stain, with culture pending. 

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis, bladder rupture, atrial fibrillation, and thrombocytopenia. For sepsis, he will continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics, maintain intravenous fluid boluses as needed, continue with central venous pressure monitoring, work with urology regarding the plan and timing for re-exploration, and maintain drain to gravity. For bladder rupture, he will maintain drain to gravity. For atrial fibrillation, no attempt at conversion will be made, and pain control will be continued. For thrombocytopenia, he will be monitored for further decline, and DIC labs and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia will be considered. 

ICU care includes bowel sounds present, nutrition consult today, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and VAP precautions."

   ICU Care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who underwent radiation therapy (XRT) and previously experienced a bladder rupture. The patient presented with abdominal pain, recurrent bladder rupture, and hypotension. He underwent surgical closure of the anterior perforation, while the posterior bladder wall perforation was left open with a drain. The etiology of the rupture is unclear, with possible causes including previous XRT, a prior rupture, and recent Foley trauma.

The patient is currently being treated for bladder rupture, peritonitis, and sepsis. He is on Vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. The surgical plan will be determined by the urology team, and the antibiotics will be continued pending culture sensitivities. The gentamicin dose will be adjusted to 120 mg q12h.

The patient also has sinus tachycardia, likely due to fluid loss and pain. Fluids will be repleted, and pain will be managed with IV dilaudid and tylenol. There is a recent drop in platelets, but it does not meet criteria for HIT, so it will be monitored daily.

The patient is experiencing altered mental status, possibly due to various factors such as mild dementia, recent surgery, sepsis, and pain. Infection, sepsis, and pain will be treated as mentioned above. Two-point restraints will be used, and consideration will"

   previous XRT and has had a rupture before.  A recent foley trauma may
   have also caused the acute bladder rupture.  He is likely still septic
   from peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight
   and his white count continues to decrease.  We have GNR from both urine
   and peritoneal fluid with speciation and sensitivities still pending.
   Patient currently on Vancomycin, cefepime and gentamycin.
   -further surgical plan per urology team
   -continue cefepime, gentamycin, and vancomycin for now pending culture
   sensitivities
   -adjust gentamycin dose to 120mg q8h
   -treat pain with tylenol 650 mg q6h standing; use narcotics sparingly
   if possible due to delirium
   # Respiratory status: CXR [**6-5**] indicative of pulmonary edema with
   bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion, although his
   oxygen saturation has been fine on nasal cannula.
   -diurese with 20 mg IV Lasix this morning
   -f/u I/O this afternoon- aim for 1L positive
   -re-check electrolyes in afternoon
   # Atrial fibrillation: Likely in setting of fluid loss and pain.
   -bolus fluids prn
   -change to IV metoprolol (5mg q6h) as patient not taking pos (and high
   residual in NGT)
   -holding off ASA/anticoagulation given recent surgery
   # Anemia: got transfused 2U on [**6-4**]. No transfusions [**6-5**]. Hemolytic
   work-up negative. Likely secondary to marrow suppression from acute
   illness and recent surgery. Currently hct stable high 20s.
   -continue to follow daily hct
   -transfuse for <25 or per urology recs
   # Low platelets: recent drop in platelets 302->234->222->207->181->144.
   Low-moderate probablilty for HIT (given there are other probable causes
   for low platelets), consider also gentamicin drug effect. Will continue
   to follow closely.
   -continue to monitor daily CBC
   # Altered mental status: He has multiple reasons for delirium,
   including baseline mild dementia, recent surgery, sepsis, and pain.
   Responded well to 2.5 Zyprexa on [**6-5**].
   -encourage reorientation, frequent contact with family

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, who has undergone radiation therapy (XRT) and had a previous bladder rupture. The patient presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a recurrent bladder rupture and hypotension. He underwent closure of the anterior perforation but still has a posterior bladder wall perforation. The patient also has drains placed in the peritoneum, bladder, and a Foley catheter.

The patient's medical conditions include:
1. Bladder rupture: The patient has had a previous rupture and now presents with a recurrent bladder rupture. The cause of the rupture is unclear, but it could be due to previous XRT, Foley trauma, or other factors.
2. Peritonitis: The patient has an infection in the peritoneal cavity, which is likely secondary to the bladder rupture.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely still septic from the peritonitis and bladder rupture. Although he was afebrile overnight, his white blood cell count is decreasing.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis and fluid loss.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an irregular heart rhythm, which is likely caused by fluid loss and pain.
6. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, likely secondary to marrow suppression from acute illness and recent surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, admitted with bladder rupture and peritonitis. He underwent an open repair and continues to have decreased drainage from IP drains. The patient had significant and persistent sepsis in the setting of active peritonitis. His hemodynamics have improved following correction, but he now has significant volume overload and large bilateral pleural effusions with pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. He will continue with drainage from JP drains and follow urology recommendations. Moving to diuresis today is planned.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): Efforts will continue to control the patient's heart rate. Lopressor IV will be used for rate control.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is largely due to large pleural effusions seen on chest X-ray. Measures will be taken to minimize oxygen use as possible, and minimal hydrostatic pulmonary edema is present.
4. Bladder Rupture: The patient's bladder rupture will be managed with pain control using dilaudid and further intervention by urology.

Other Issues:
- Hypoglycemia: The patient may require monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
- Peritonitis (non-SBP): The patient has ongoing periton"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 87 yo man with history of prostate CA s/p XRT and prior bladder
   rupture presenting with abd pain, recurrent bladder rupture and
   hypotension now s/p closure of anterior perforation, still with
   posterior bladder wall perforation. Currently with three drains- one to
   peritoneum, one to bladder, and a foley catheter.
   # Bladder rupture, Peritonitis, Sepsis, Hypotension: s/p closure of
   anterior perforation; posterior perforation left open with drain. The
   etiology of the rupture remains unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has friable tissue from
   previous XRT and has had a rupture before.  A recent foley trauma may
   have also caused the acute bladder rupture.  He is likely still septic
   from peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight
   and his white count continues to decrease.  We have GNR from both urine
   and peritoneal fluid with speciation and sensitivities still pending.
   Patient currently on Vancomycin, cefepime and gentamycin.
   -further surgical plan per urology team
   -continue cefepime; could consider stopping gentamicin and vancomycin
   -treat pain with tylenol 650 mg q6h standing; use narcotics sparingly
   if possible due to delirium
   # Respiratory status: CXR [**6-5**] indicative of pulmonary edema with
   bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion, although his
   oxygen saturation has been fine on nasal cannula.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Likely in setting of fluid loss and pain.
   -bolus fluids prn
   -continue metoprolol
   -holding off ASA/anticoagulation given recent surgery
   # Anemia: got transfused 2U on [**6-4**]. No transfusions [**6-5**]. Hemolytic
   work-up negative. Likely secondary to marrow suppression from acute
   illness and recent surgery. Currently hct stable at 30.
   -continue to follow daily hct
   -transfuse for <25 or per urology recs
   # Low platelets: recent drop in platelet, although now stable.
   Low-moderate probablilty for HIT (given there are other probable causes
   for low platelets), consider also gentamicin drug effect. Will continue
   to follow closely.
   -continue to monitor daily CBC
   # Altered mental status: He has multiple reasons for delirium,
   including baseline mild dementia, recent surgery, sepsis, and pain.
   Responded well to 2.5 Zyprexa on [**6-5**].
   -encourage reorientation, frequent contact with family
   -treat infection, sepsis, pain as above
   -2-point restraints
   -continue Zyprexa qhs prn if agitation worsening at night
   -minimize Dilaudid, if possible
   # DM:
   -HISS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer and prior bladder rupture. He presented with abdominal pain, recurrent bladder rupture, and hypotension. The patient underwent surgery for the closure of an anterior perforation, and the posterior bladder wall perforation was left open with a drain.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:
1. Bladder rupture: The patient had a recent Foley trauma that may have caused an acute bladder rupture. He also has a history of prostate cancer treatment and previous bladder rupture.
2. Peritonitis: The patient likely has peritonitis due to the open posterior bladder wall perforation.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely septic from peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight and his white blood cell count continues to decrease. He is currently on antibiotics.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension and required resuscitation.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, likely in the setting of fluid loss and pain.
6. Respiratory status: The patient's chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion.
7. Anemia: The patient received a blood transfusion and has a low hemoglobin level, possibly secondary to marrow suppression from acute illness and recent surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 87 yo man with history of prostate CA s/p XRT and prior bladder
   rupture presenting with [**Last Name (un) 499**] pain, recurrent bladder rupture and
   hypotension now s/p closure of anterior perforation, still with
   posterior bladder wall perforation. Currently with three drains- one to
   peritoneum, one to bladder, and a foley catheter.
   # Bladder rupture, Peritonitis, Sepsis, Hypotension: s/p closure of
   anterior perforation; posterior perforation left open with drain. The
   etiology of the rupture remains unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has friable tissue from
   previous XRT and has had a rupture before.  A recent foley trauma may
   have also caused the acute bladder rupture.  He is likely still septic
   from peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight
   and his white count continues to decrease.  Peritoneal fluid cultures
   are growing out Pseudomonas, sensitivities pending. He is currently on
   Vancomycin, cefepime and gentamycin.
   -further surgical plan per urology team
   -continue cefepime, vanco, gentamicin; he will likely need 10-14d
   course
   -treat pain with tylenol 650 mg q6h standing; use narcotics sparingly
   if possible due to delirium
   # Respiratory status: CXR [**6-5**] indicative of pulmonary edema with
   bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion, although his
   oxygen saturation has been fine on nasal cannula. Yesterday he had
   excellent urine output after 20 mg IV Lasix.
   -give additional 20 mg IV Lasix today
   # Atrial fibrillation: Likely in setting of fluid loss and pain.
   -bolus fluids prn
   -continue metoprolol
   -holding off ASA/anticoagulation given recent surgery
   # Anemia: got transfused 2U on [**6-4**]. No transfusions [**6-5**]. Hemolytic
   work-up negative. Likely secondary to marrow suppression from acute
   illness and recent surgery. Currently hct stable at 30.
   -continue to follow daily hct
   -transfuse for <25 or per urology recs
   # Low platelets: recent drop in platelet, although now stable.
   Low-moderate probablilty for HIT (given there are other probable causes
   for low platelets), consider also gentamicin drug effect. Will continue
   to follow closely.
   -continue to monitor daily CBC
   # Altered mental status: He has multiple reasons for delirium,
   including baseline mild dementia, recent surgery, sepsis, and pain.
   Responded well to 2.5 Zyprexa on [**6-5**].
   -encourage reorientation, frequent contact with family
   -treat infection, sepsis, pain as above
   -2-point restraints
   -continue Zyprexa qhs prn if agitation worsening at night
   -minimize Dilaudid, if possible

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer and previous bladder rupture. He presented with severe pain, recurrent bladder rupture, and hypotension. He underwent surgery for closure of the anterior perforation but still has a posterior bladder wall perforation. The patient has multiple drains in place and a Foley catheter. He is currently septic from peritonitis/bladder rupture, but his fever has subsided overnight, and his white blood cell count is decreasing. Cultures of peritoneal fluid are growing out Pseudomonas, with sensitivities pending. The patient is on Vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. A surgical plan will be determined by the urology team. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion, as seen on chest X-ray. His oxygen saturation has been fine on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, likely due to fluid loss and pain. He has anemia, likely secondary to marrow suppression from acute illness and recent surgery, and his platelet count has recently dropped but is now stable. The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to baseline mild dementia, recent surgery, sepsis, and pain. He responded well to Zyprexa on [**6-5**]. Other medical conditions include diabetes, hypertension, and depression. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including tube"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who underwent radiation therapy (XRT) and had a previous bladder rupture. He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a recurrent bladder rupture and hypotension. The patient underwent surgical closure of the anterior perforation, but the posterior bladder wall perforation was left open with a drain.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Bladder Rupture: The patient has already experienced two episodes of bladder rupture, which can be life-threatening and may require surgical intervention.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely still septic from the peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight. He has GNR (Gram-negative rods) from both urine and peritoneal fluid, and the sensitivity testing is still pending. The patient is currently on Vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin, which are antibiotics used to treat severe infections.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis, fluid loss, or pain. It is important to monitor his blood pressure closely and provide appropriate treatment.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may be related to fluid loss and pain. He is being treated with metoprolol, and his anticoagulation status is being monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 87 yo man with history of prostate CA s/p XRT and prior bladder
   rupture presenting with abd pain, recurrent bladder rupture and
   hypotension now s/p closure of anterior perforation, still with
   posterior bladder wall perforation. Currently with three drains- one to
   peritoneum, one to bladder, and a foley catheter.
   # Bladder rupture, Peritonitis, Sepsis, Hypotension: s/p closure of
   anterior perforation; posterior perforation left open with drain. The
   etiology of the rupture remains unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has friable tissue from
   previous XRT and has had a rupture before.  A recent foley trauma may
   have also caused the acute bladder rupture.  He is likely still septic
   from peritonitis/bladder rupture, although he was afebrile overnight
   and his white count continues to decrease.  We have GNR from both urine
   and peritoneal fluid with speciation and sensitivities still pending.
   Patient currently on Vancomycin, cefepime and gentamycin.
   -further surgical plan per urology team
   -continue cefepime; could consider stopping gentamicin and Zosyn
   -treat pain with tylenol 650 mg q6h standing; use narcotics sparingly
   if possible due to delirium
   # Respiratory status: CXR [**6-5**] indicative of pulmonary edema with
   bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion, although his
   oxygen saturation has been fine on nasal cannula.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Likely in setting of fluid loss and pain.
   -bolus fluids prn
   -continue metoprolol
   -holding off ASA/anticoagulation given recent surgery
   # Anemia: got transfused 2U on [**6-4**]. No transfusions [**6-5**]. Hemolytic
   work-up negative. Likely secondary to marrow suppression from acute
   illness and recent surgery. Currently hct stable at 30.
   -continue to follow daily hct
   -transfuse for <25 or per urology recs
   # Low platelets: recent drop in platelet, although now stable.
   Low-moderate probablilty for HIT (given there are other probable causes
   for low platelets), consider also gentamicin drug effect. Will continue
   to follow closely.
   -continue to monitor daily CBC
   # Altered mental status: He has multiple reasons for delirium,
   including baseline mild dementia, recent surgery, sepsis, and pain.
   Responded well to 2.5 Zyprexa on [**6-5**].
   -encourage reorientation, frequent contact with family
   -treat infection, sepsis, pain as above
   -2-point restraints
   -continue Zyprexa qhs prn if agitation worsening at night
   -minimize Dilaudid, if possible
   # DM:
   -HISS
   # History of hypertension:
   -hold BP meds until post-op, sepsis resolved

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a recurrent bladder rupture and hypotension. He underwent closure of the anterior perforation but still has a posterior bladder wall perforation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple drains, including one to the peritoneum, one to the bladder, and a Foley catheter. He has been diagnosed with urosepsis and peritonitis, likely due to the bladder rupture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already septic from peritonitis/bladder rupture. Continued monitoring and aggressive management of infection are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis, fluid loss, and pain. Close monitoring and fluid resuscitation are required.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may be exacerbated by fluid loss and pain. Management with metoprolol and close monitoring are recommended.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with signs of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. This may necessitate advanced respiratory support, such as intubation.
5. Anemia: The patient received a blood transfusion due to acute illness and recent surgery. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and transfusing as needed is important.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male who was admitted with a bladder rupture and is now showing improvement in their tolerance of chest physical therapy, mobilization, and weaning of narcotics. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin (warfarin sodium), oxycodone, megestrol acetate, Remeron (mirtazapine), and Ritalin (methylphenidate Hcl). The patient has been receiving various medications, including gentamicin, cefepime, vancomycin, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status closely and adjust medications accordingly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control. This condition increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. It is crucial to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and ensure appropriate management.
3. Sepsis/Peritonitis: The patient has sepsis and peritonitis, for which he is receiving antibiotics. Inadequate treatment or progression of the infection can lead to further complications. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
