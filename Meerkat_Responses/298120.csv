   # GI Bleed: Bleeding scan positive for bleeding from sigmoid colon,
   likely due to diverticulosis. Angiogram shows no evidence of active
   bleeding.  Other causes could be hemrrhoidal bleeding or missed
   diverticular bleeding on angiography.  Continues to pass clots this
   morning.  She is s/p 2 units of PRBC overnight.  Her Hct did not bump
   to the blood, but has remained stable in the low 30
   - Maintain serial hematocrits q4 hours. [**Month (only) 51**] require additional PRBC if
   s/s hemodynamic instability persist.  Will transfuse for Hct < 30 as

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding scan was positive for the sigmoid colon, likely due to diverticulosis. However, no evidence of active bleeding was found during angiography. The patient continues to pass clots and is awaiting a flexible sigmoidoscopy (flex-sig). She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight and her hematocrit has remained stable at around 32%. 

The patient experienced a syncopal episode after the angiography study, prior to receiving PRBC infusion. It is likely secondary to volume loss in the setting of active GI bleed. There were no postictal confusion or incontinence, making a seizure unlikely. The patient also had a vagal response to a bowel movement prior to the event. 

Telemetry shows sinus bradycardia, which may be due to metoprolol. The patient's other vital signs are stable, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. 

The patient has hypokalemia, for which 40 mEq KCl PO was given. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite the positive bleeding scan and the presence of clots, there is still a risk of re-bleeding. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary if symptoms worsen or if there is evidence of ongoing bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo female with hx of CAD, diverticulosis here with BRBPR with a
   positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon, however no evidence of
   bleeding by angiography continuing to pass clots and awaiting flex sig.
   # GI Bleed: Bleeding scan positive for bleeding from sigmoid colon,
   likely due to diverticulosis. Angiogram shows no evidence of active
   bleeding.  Other causes could be hemrrhoidal bleeding, ischemic bowel,
   or missed diverticular bleeding on angiography.  Continues to pass
   clots this morning.  She is s/p 2 units of PRBC overnight.  Her Hct did
   not bump to the blood, but has remained stable in the low 30
   - Maintain serial hematocrits q4 hours. [**Month (only) 51**] require additional PRBC if
   s/s hemodynamic instability persist.  Will transfuse for Hct < 30 as
   she is actively passing clots.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI is follwing, appreciate consult
 plans for a flex-sig today.
   - Continue to hold clopidogrel and aspirin.
   - Active type and screen
   - Will obtain a surgical consult due to possibility of need for
   surgical intervention.
   # Syncopal episode yesterday:  Likely secondary from volume loss in the
   settting of active GI bleed.  No postictal confusion or incontience so
   sz unlikely.  [**Month (only) 51**] have also had a vagal response to bowel movement
   prior to the event.  No current dizziness this am or further episodes.
   Tele shows sinus brady.
   - Continue to monitor and follow tele closely.
   #Hypokalemia: 40 mEq KCl PO x 1 dose given. 2g Mag sulfate.
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Patient currently asymptomatic.
   - Continue pravastatin.
   - Holding ASA and B-blocker given risk of bleed.
   #NIDDM: RISS. Blood glucose well-controlled at this time. Metformin
   held.
   #Depression: Continue home medications.

   The patient was seen and examined and this note was written by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Doctor Last Name 4842**], MS4.
   I examined the patient and agree with the above note by Ed.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and diverticulosis. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, which was initially suspected to be from the sigmoid colon due to diverticulosis. However, no evidence of active bleeding was found during an angiography. The patient has been passing clots and is awaiting a flexible sigmoidoscopy (flex-sig) for further evaluation.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight, but her hematocrit (Hct) level did not increase significantly. Her Hct remains stable at 32%. The plan is to continue monitoring her hematocrit every 4 hours and transfuse additional PRBC if there are signs of hemodynamic instability or if she continues to pass clots.

The patient is also on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is being followed by gastroenterology for the flex-sig procedure. Clopidogrel and aspirin have been held due to the active bleeding. A surgical consult has been obtained due to the possibility of needing surgical intervention.

The patient experienced a syncopal episode yesterday, which is likely secondary to volume loss in the setting of active gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no postictal confusion or incontinence, making a seizure unlikely. The patient also had a vagal response to a bowel movement prior to the event. No further episodes of dizziness have been reported.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with gastrointestinal bleeding. She has a history of coronary artery disease, NIDDM, and hypokalemia. 

On the night of 01/18/2012, the patient underwent a nuclear medicine bleeding scan, which showed positive findings for bleeding in the sigmoid colon. An angiogram was performed but did not reveal any evidence of active bleeding. After the procedure, the patient experienced a syncopal episode prior to receiving a blood transfusion. She received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during the late evening. Despite the transfusion, the patient's hematocrit level remained stable at 32%. There were no further signs of bleeding, and her vital signs were stable with slightly bradycardia and sleep. The patient reported having blood in her stool this morning, although it was not bright red blood.

The patient's allergies include codeine, nausea/vomiting, erythromycin base, and an unknown allergy to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). Her last dose of antibiotics was unknown.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature ranged from 35.7°C to 37.1°C, blood pressure ranged from 159/79 mmHg to 163/128 mmHg, heart rate was between 56-68 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and recent colonoscopy. The patient experienced a large bloody bowel movement, became vagal, and passed out. An angiography was performed, which showed no evidence of active bleeding. The patient continues to have bloody bowel movements and complains of a sore stomach. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4°C (95.7°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/63 mmHg to 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with no oxygen delivery device. His ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness, and absent peripheral pulses. The patient's skin is warm, and his neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 246 K/uL, platelet count of 246 K/uL, blood glucose of 97 mg/dL, sodium of 23 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 13 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL, phosphate of 3.0 mg/dL, PT/PTT of 14.3/34.9, INR of 1.2, calcium of 7.4 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 32.0%. The patient has undergone a tagged RBC scan and mesenteric angiography.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concern is gastrointestinal bleeding, most likely due to diverticulosis given his age and symptoms. The tagged scan localized the bleed to the distal sigmoid, which also fits the clinical picture. Recent colonoscopy makes malignancy less likely. The patient's hematocrit will be monitored, and he will be transfused to keep it above 30% due to coronary artery disease. A GI service consultation was unhelpful due to stool in the colon. Surgery is on standby in case of an urgent need for surgery.

The patient's beta-blocker therapy is being held to ensure hemodynamic stability, as well as aspirin and clopidogrel due to the gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient should be monitored for acute coronary syndrome and kept hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit above 30%. Statin therapy will continue. Metformin has been held.

The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers are being managed in the ICU. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   78 yo female with hx of CAD, diverticulosis here with BRBPR with a
   positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon, however no evidence of
   bleeding by angiography continuing to pass clots and awaiting flex sig.
   # GI Bleed: Bleeding scan positive for bleeding from sigmoid colon,
   likely due to diverticulosis. Angiogram shows no evidence of active
   bleeding.  Other causes could be hemrrhoidal bleeding, ischemic bowel,
   or missed diverticular bleeding on angiography.  Continues to pass
   clots this morning.  She is s/p 2 units of PRBC 2 nights ago.  Her Hct
   did not bump to the blood, but has remained stable in the low 30
   - Change serial hematocrits to q6 hours, as patient
s hematocrit has
   been stable at around 30 . [**Month (only) 51**] require additional PRBC if s/s
   hemodynamic instability persist.  Will transfuse for Hct < 30 as she is
   actively passing clots.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI is follwing, appreciate consult
 plans for colonoscopy tomorrow.
   Will require bowel preparation tonight.
   - Continue to hold clopidogrel and aspirin.
   - Active type and screen
   - Appreciate surgical consult- patient offered elective partial
   colectomy if bleeding persists. Patient does not wish to proceed with
   colectomy at this time but understands this procedure is the treatment
   for recurrent GI bleeds.
   # Syncopal episode:  No further episodes of syncope or dizziness/
   lightheadedness yesterday. Likely secondary from volume loss in the
   settting of active GI bleed.  No postictal confusion or incontience so
   sz unlikely.  [**Month (only) 51**] have also had a vagal response to bowel movement
   prior to the event.  No current dizziness this am or further episodes.
   Tele shows sinus brady.
   - Continue to monitor and follow tele closely.
   #Hypokalemia: 40 mEq KCl PO x 1 dose given. 2g Mag sulfate.
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Patient currently asymptomatic.
   - Continue pravastatin.
   - Holding ASA and B-blocker given risk of bleed.
   - Cardiologist made aware- ok with clopidogrel being held.
   #NIDDM: RISS. Blood glucose well-controlled at this time. Metformin
   held.
   #Depression: Continue home medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and diverticulosis. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, characterized by hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, and coffee ground emesis. The bleeding scan showed positive findings in the sigmoid colon, likely due to diverticulosis. Angiography did not reveal active bleeding, but other potential causes such as hemorrhoidal bleeding, ischemic bowel, or missed diverticular bleeding were not ruled out. The patient continues to pass clots and her hematocrit has remained stable at around 30%. She received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) two nights ago.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of diverticulosis and the ongoing passage of clots, there is a risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Hypotension and shock: The patient's initial presentation of lower gastrointestinal bleeding may have led to significant blood loss, resulting in hypotension and potential shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is crucial.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization, use of invasive lines and catheters, and immunosuppression can increase the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
4. Kidney injury: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate a possible kidney injury"

   78 yo female with hx of CAD, diverticulosis here with BRBPR with a
   positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon, however no evidence of
   bleeding by angiography continuing to pass clots and awaiting flex sig.
   # GI Bleed: Bleeding scan positive for bleeding from sigmoid colon,
   likely due to diverticulosis. Angiogram shows no evidence of active
   bleeding.  Other causes could be hemrrhoidal bleeding, ischemic bowel,
   or missed diverticular bleeding on angiography.  Continues to pass
   clots this morning.  She is s/p 2 units of PRBC 2 nights ago.  Her Hct
   did not bump to the blood, but has remained stable in the low 30
   - check q6 hct hours, as patient
s hematocrit has been stable at around
   30 . [**Month (only) 51**] require additional PRBC if s/s hemodynamic instability occurs,
   though she is stable now.  Will transfuse for Hct < 30 as she is
   actively passing clots.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI is following, appreciate consult
 plans for colonoscopy tomorrow.
   Will require bowel preparation tonight.
   - Continue to hold clopidogrel and aspirin
   - Active type and screen
   - Appreciate surgical consult- patient offered elective partial
   colectomy if bleeding persists. Patient does not wish to proceed with
   colectomy at this time but understands this procedure is the treatment
   for a recurrent GI bleed
   # Syncopal episode:  No further episodes of syncope or dizziness/
   lightheadedness yesterday. Likely secondary from volume loss in the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and diverticulosis. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleed, specifically hematochezia, which was confirmed by a positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon. Despite angiography showing no evidence of active bleeding, the patient continues to pass clots. She received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) two nights ago and has maintained a stable hematocrit level around 30%. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/70-145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on NPO status with maintenance fluids and will require bowel preparation for the planned colonoscopy tomorrow. 

She has been holding clopidogrel and aspirin due to the active gastrointestinal bleed. The patient understands that if the bleeding persists, she may need an elective partial colectomy, which she currently does not wish to proceed with. 

The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are slightly low, and platelet count is slightly elevated. Her creatinine and glucose levels are within normal limits. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diverticulosis, diabetes mellitus type 2"

She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and was found to have a positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon, likely due to diverticulosis. However, angiography did not show any evidence of active bleeding. The patient is currently passing clots and awaiting a flexible sigmoidoscopy (flex sig) to further evaluate the source of bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/70 mmHg to 145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. She is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show a hematocrit level of 30.3%, indicating significant blood loss. Other lab values are within normal limits, including white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient is currently receiving IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been held on clopidogrel and aspirin due to the risk of bleeding. She has also been given 40 mEq KCl orally and 2g of magnesium sulfate.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   78 yo female with hx of CAD, diverticulosis here with BRBPR with a
   positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon, however no evidence of
   bleeding by angiography continuing to pass clots and awaiting flex sig.
   # GI Bleed: Bleeding scan positive for bleeding from sigmoid colon,
   likely due to diverticulosis. Angiogram shows no evidence of active
   bleeding.  Other causes could be hemrrhoidal bleeding, ischemic bowel,
   or missed diverticular bleeding on angiography.  Continues to pass
   clots this morning.  She is s/p 2 units of PRBC overnight.  Her Hct did
   not bump to the blood, but has remained stable in the low 30
   - Maintain serial hematocrits q4 hours. [**Month (only) 51**] require additional PRBC if
   s/s hemodynamic instability persist.  Will transfuse for Hct < 30 as
   she is actively passing clots.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI is follwing, appreciate consult
 plans for a flex-sig today.
   - Continue to hold clopidogrel and aspirin.
   - Active type and screen
   - Will obtain a surgical consult due to possibility of need for
   surgical intervention.
   # Syncopal episode yesterday:  Likely secondary from volume loss in the
   settting of active GI bleed.  No postictal confusion or incontience so
   sz unlikely.  [**Month (only) 51**] have also had a vagal response to bowel movement
   prior to the event.  No current dizziness this am or further episodes.
   Tele shows sinus brady.
   - Continue to monitor and follow tele closely.
   #Hypokalemia: 40 mEq KCl PO x 1 dose given. 2g Mag sulfate.
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Patient currently asymptomatic.
   - Continue pravastatin.
   - Holding ASA and B-blocker given risk of bleed.
   #NIDDM: RISS. Blood glucose well-controlled at this time. Metformin
   held.
   #Depression: Continue home medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and diverticulosis. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and was found to have a positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid colon. Angiography showed no evidence of active bleeding, but she continues to pass clots. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight and her hematocrit (Hct) remained stable in the low 30s.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is actively passing clots, indicating ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and serial hematocrits is essential to determine if further blood transfusions are needed.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, but ongoing blood loss can lead to hypotension and tachycardia. Frequent assessment of vital signs and prompt intervention with fluids or additional PRBCs may be necessary.
3. Infection: The patient is on prophylactic stress ulcer medication (PPI) and has received antibiotics. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection, such as fever or leukocytosis, and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy if indicated.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and adequate hydration are crucial to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, most likely due to diverticulosis given their age and symptoms. A tagged scan localized the bleeding to the distal sigmoid colon, which is consistent with diverticular disease. A recent colonoscopy was performed, but it was unhelpful due to retained stool in the colon. The patient's peripheral pulses are absent in both lower extremities. Vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/50 mmHg to 145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +525 mL, and their blood products total 27 mL. The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hematocrit of 33.7%, platelet count of 246 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, glucose level of 97 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and is on various medications including RISS, Lexapro, pravastatin, and Wellbutrin.

   Assessment and Plan
   GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER- most likely diverticular given age and
   symptoms. Tagged scan localized to distal sigmoid which also fits.
   Recent colon in [**2110**] makes malig less likely.
   -Cont serial Hct checks, tranfuse to keep Hct > 30 given CAD
   -GI svce consulted; sigmoidoscopy unhelpful secondary to stool in
   colon. Surgery came by to see patient in case of need for urgent
   surgery.
   -Continue to hold clopidogrel and aspirin.
   -Holding BB for now to ensure hemodynamic stablity
   -ok to have clears today per GI; npo after MN w/ poss prep for
   colonoscopy
   CAD- s/p stent few years ago, no evidence of ACS at this point.
   Bradycardic despite holding BB therapy
   -holding ASA and clopidogrel given issue #1 (spoke to 1' cardiologist
   and ok)
   -monitor for ACS, keep Hct > 30
   -cont statin
   NIDDM- RISS. Blood glucose well-controlled at this time. Metformin
   held.
