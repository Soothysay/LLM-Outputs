   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Currently, the patient
   exhibits symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with
   peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP.
   Weight is significantly elevated from dry weight. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - continue diuresis with torsemide
   - right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator following
   adequate diuresis
   - continue metoprolol
   - consider starting ACE I again, but would favor diuresis first
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Altered mental
   status could be related to poor forward flow in setting of heart
   failure. However, asterixis suggests a toxic-metabolic cause. This has
   been attributed to uremia in the past, but BUN/Cr do not seen elevated
   enough to explain the patient's encephalopathy.  Other possibilities
   include non-convulsive seizures, infection, and accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - consult neurology
   - check UA, UCx
   .
   # Recent treatment for presumed PNA: Was on cefepime and linezolid and
   OSH for possible pneumonia but no evidence of fever, leukocytosis, or
   infiltrate.
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and mechanical aortic valve replacement. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient exhibits symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure. There has been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient's weight is significantly elevated from his dry weight.

The patient is currently on diuretics, metoprolol, and has had a right and left heart catheterization with a trial of vasodilator. He also has altered mental status, which could be related to hypercarbia or a toxic-metabolic cause. His recent treatment for presumed pneumonia was not supported by any evidence of fever, leukocytosis, or infiltrate. The patient has chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, a mechanical aortic valve, atrial fibrillation with a single-chamber pacemaker, and a history of coronary artery disease.

The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, low potassium levels, high bicarbonate levels, and low BUN levels. His urine output has been variable, ranging from 90 mL to 650 mL over the"

   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Currently, the patient
   exhibits symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with
   peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP.
   Weight is significantly elevated from dry weight. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. (Note that home dose of
   diuretic changes, but will often be torsemide 40mg daily to [**Hospital1 **].
   Sometimes, metolazone 2.5mg is added on a PRN basis.  Per review of
   recent notes from heart failure clinic, his optimal weight is 155-160#,
   but that there is no particular volume at which he both has no edema
   and has good forward flow.  He may very well need elevated filling
   pressures (with associated LE edema, elevated JVP) in order to have
   sufficient output to support his mental status and perfuse his
   kidneys.)
   - check EKG
   - right heart cath in a.m., NPO after midnight

   in setting of heart failure. However, asterixis suggests a
   toxic-metabolic cause. This has been attributed to uremia in the past,

   encephalopathy.  Discussed with pharmacy whether lamictal may be
   contributing as it is renally eliminated and somnolence is a common
   side effect, but there is no clear dose adjustment in renal failure.
   Would also consider infection, non-convulsive seizures, hypercarbia.

   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Currently, the patient
   exhibits symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with
   peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP.
   Weight is significantly elevated from dry weight. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - continue diuresis with torsemide
   - right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator following
   adequate diuresis
   - continue metoprolol
   - consider starting ACE I again, but would favor diuresis first
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Altered mental
   status could be related to poor forward flow in setting of heart
   failure. However, asterixis suggests a toxic-metabolic cause. This has
   been attributed to uremia in the past, but BUN/Cr do not seen elevated
   enough to explain the patient's encephalopathy.  Other possibilities
   include non-convulsive seizures, infection, and accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - consult neurology
   - check UA, UCx
   .
   # Recent treatment for presumed PNA: Was on cefepime and linezolid and
   OSH for possible pneumonia but no evidence of fever, leukocytosis, or
   infiltrate.
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.

   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure

   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and a mechanical aortic valve. He has been admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current symptoms include predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). He also has a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation, which may be contributing to his symptoms. The patient's weight is significantly elevated from his dry weight, and he has moderate urine output with PO torsemide.

The patient is currently on several medications, including metoprolol, torsemide, heparin gtt, and simvastatin. He is also being treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and fluoroquinolone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms of right-sided heart failure and elevated JVP suggest ongoing diastolic dysfunction. If his heart failure worsens, it may lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress,"

   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Currently, the patient
   exhibits symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with
   peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP.
   Weight is significantly elevated from dry weight. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - continue diuresis with torsemide
   - right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator following
   adequate diuresis
   - continue metoprolol
   - consider starting ACE I again, but would favor diuresis first
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Altered mental
   status could be related to poor forward flow in setting of heart
   failure. However, asterixis suggests a toxic-metabolic cause. This has
   been attributed to uremia in the past, but BUN/Cr do not seen elevated
   enough to explain the patient's encephalopathy.  Other possibilities
   include non-convulsive seizures, infection, and accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - consult neurology
   - check UA, UCx
   .
   # Recent treatment for presumed PNA: Was on cefepime and linezolid and
   OSH for possible pneumonia but no evidence of fever, leukocytosis, or
   infiltrate.
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.

   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure

   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.

   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is -3.5 L over the length of stay.
   Yesterday had minimal urine output from PO torsemide, so IV lasix given
   with net negative 1.2 L.
   - continue diuresis with home dose torsemide +/- lasix if needed for
   goal 1
 1.5 L
   - plan right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely etiology at this point is infection,
   although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function could be
   contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG.  EEG recommended by
   neurology to r/o seizures.  Patient has 8%  bands on Differential which
   is concerning for infection.  Has been afebrile to hypothermic (which
   may actually be SIRS criteria) and CXR difficult to r/o pneumonia
   underlying pulmonary edema.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u EEG final read and neurology recs
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - treat empirically for HAP with vanc, cefipime, will add
   fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential shows bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin

   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale

   Cardiology Attending Progress Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], MD
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   He is disoriented and has [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 2022**] breathing
 this is consistent
   with a very low cardiac output.  We are considering that Haldol may
   have contributed to his mental status but this may also be due to a low
   cardiac output state.
   Medical Decision Making
   We are excluding other metabolic causes of his mental status change.
   Catheterization cannot be performed at this time due to his
   anticoagulation and inability to lie flat.   We will extend ICU care
   for 24 hours.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and a mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current conditions include acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, infection, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mediastinal adenopathy. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including diuretics, vasodilators, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening heart failure, sepsis secondary to infection, acute kidney injury, respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation or pneumonia, and further deterioration of mental status.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, renal function, and respiratory status. Regular assessment of mental status and appropriate management of any potential infections or complications are also crucial. Adjustments in medication doses and monitoring for adverse effects should be considered."

   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is -3.5 L over the length of stay.
   Yesterday had minimal urine output from PO torsemide, so IV lasix given
   with net negative 1.2 L.
   - continue diuresis with home dose torsemide +/- lasix if needed for
   goal 1
 1.5 L
   - plan right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely etiology at this point is infection,
   although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function could be
   contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG.  EEG recommended by
   neurology to r/o seizures.  Patient has 8%  bands on Differential which
   is concerning for infection.  Has been afebrile to hypothermic (which
   may actually be SIRS criteria) and CXR difficult to r/o pneumonia
   underlying pulmonary edema.
   - avoid sedating medications

   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - treat empirically for HAP with vanc, cefipime, will add
   fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens

   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential shows bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone

   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and third-degree heart block with permanent pacemaker placement.
- The patient presented with symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).
- The patient's condition has been worsening, with increased tricuspid regurgitation contributing to the symptoms.
- The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which is likely due to infection, but other possible causes such as worsening CHF, uremia, or medication accumulation are also considered.
- The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, with recent baseline creatinine levels ranging from 1.6 to 1.9.
- The patient has been treated for presumed pneumonia at the outside hospital (OSH) with cefepime and linezolid.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving vasopressor support.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 121/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and a mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure. The patient's symptoms include predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). There has been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, possibly due to hypercarbia, poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure, or a toxic-metabolic cause such as uremia. Asterixis suggests a toxic-metabolic cause, and an EEG is recommended by neurology to rule out seizures. The patient also has a history of infection, with a recent treatment for presumed pneumonia at an outside hospital and current signs of bandemia. Additionally, the patient has chronic kidney disease, with a baseline creatinine of 1.6-1.9. His COPD is being managed with nebulized bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. The patient also has mediastinal adenopathy of unclear etiology, a mechanical aortic valve that is"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is -4.2 L over the length of stay.  He is
   intermittently unable to take PO medications
   - continue diuresis with daily doses of lasix given unable to take PO
   intermittantly
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   or later pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG.  EEG
   recommended by neurology to r/o seizures and was negative.  Patient had
   8%  bands on Differential which was concerning for infection so is
   being treated fro HAP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP with vanc, cefipime, will add
   fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - contact neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   -          hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.
   -           on hep gtt
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is -3.5 L over the length of stay.
   Yesterday had minimal urine output from PO torsemide, so IV lasix given
   with net negative 1.2 L.
   - continue diuresis with home dose torsemide +/- lasix if needed for
   goal 1
 1.5 L
   - plan right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely etiology at this point is infection,
   although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function could be
   contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG.  EEG recommended by
   neurology to r/o seizures.  Patient has 8%  bands on Differential which
   is concerning for infection.  Has been afebrile to hypothermic (which
   may actually be SIRS criteria) and CXR difficult to r/o pneumonia
   underlying pulmonary edema.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u EEG final read and neurology recs
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - treat empirically for HAP with vanc, cefipime, will add
   fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential shows bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and third-degree heart block treated with a permanent pacemaker (PPM). The patient was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current conditions include acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). There has also been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's weight is significantly elevated from his dry weight of 151 lbs.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, likely due to infection, although other causes such as worsening CHF, uremia, or accumulation of medications in the setting of decreased renal function could also be contributing factors. The patient has an elevated band count on the differential, which is concerning for infection. He is afebrile to hypothermic and has underlying pulmonary edema.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a recent baseline creatinine level of 1.6-1.9. His urine sediment is bland, and the likely etiology is poor forward flow."

   Medical Decision Making
   He is continuing to diurese and likely approaching his dry weight.  His
   prognosis is very guarded.

   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is -4.2 L over the length of stay.  He is
   intermittently unable to take PO medications
   - continue diuresis with daily doses of lasix given unable to take PO
   intermittantly
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   or later pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG.  EEG
   recommended by neurology to r/o seizures and was negative.  Patient had
   8%  bands on Differential which was concerning for infection so is
   being treated fro HAP.

   -Continue empiric tx for HAP with vanc, cefipime, will add
   fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - contact neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF

   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls

   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and third-degree heart block status post pacemaker placement. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). He also has worsening tricuspid regurgitation, which may be contributing to his symptoms. The patient requires a degree of peripheral edema to maintain cardiac output and has had moderate urine output with oral torsemide. He is intermittently unable to take oral medications.

The patient is being treated for infection, specifically hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with antibiotics vancomycin and cefepime. However, the source of infection could also be explained by CHF exacerbation. He has a history of recent treatment for presumed pneumonia at another hospital with cefepime and linezolid.

The patient's mental status is altered, with unclear etiology. Potential causes include infection, worsening CHF, uremia, or accumulation of medications in the setting of decreased renal function"

   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is intermittently unable to take PO
   medications
   - continue diuresis with daily doses of lasix given unable to take PO
   intermittently
   - monitor Is/Os for goal 1-1.5 negative
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   or later pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG.  EEG
   recommended by neurology to r/o seizures and was negative.  Patient had
   8%  bands on Differential which was concerning for infection so is
   being treated fro HAP.  Mental status slightly improved overnight.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - contact neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   -          hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.
   -           on hep gtt
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and mechanical aortic valve replacement. He presents with symptoms of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, including right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). The patient has been treated for presumed pneumonia at an outside hospital and is now being evaluated for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He also has chronic kidney disease, COPD, and mediastinal adenopathy of unclear etiology. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms suggest ongoing diastolic dysfunction and right-sided heart failure. If his heart failure worsens, it could lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and decreased organ perfusion.

2. Infection/sepsis: The patient's bandemia and hypothermia raise concern for an ongoing infection. If he develops sepsis, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.

3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors including infection, uremia, or medication accumulation. If left untreated, delirium can progress to confusion, agitation, and increased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and mechanical aortic valve placement. He presented with symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure. The patient also has a recent worsening of tricuspid regurgitation. He is currently in the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms of right-sided heart failure and elevated JVP indicate worsening of his chronic diastolic heart failure. The recent worsening of tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to his symptoms. The goal is to maintain preload and improve cardiac output.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and the etiology is unclear. Possible causes include infection, worsening CHF, uremia, or accumulation of medications in the setting of decreased renal function. The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and cerebral hypoperfusion. An EEG was performed to rule out seizures, and it was negative. The patient has shown some improvement overnight.
3. Infection: The patient has a bandemia on the differential, which is concerning for infection. He is being treated empirically for HAP with vancomycin and cef"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is intermittently unable to take PO
   medications
   - continue diuresis with daily doses of lasix given unable to take PO
   intermittently, recommend another 80mg IV ONCE
   - monitor Is/Os for goal 1-1.5 negative
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Consider
   cerebral hypoperfusion. EEG recommended by neurology to r/o seizures
   and was negative.  Patient had 8%  bands on Differential which was
   concerning for infection so is being treated fro HAP.  Mental status
   slightly improved overnight.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - contact neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Improved. The patient is actually at his
   recent baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely
   etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   -          hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.
   -           on hep gtt
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute anemia: Acute HCT drop likely secondary to new right flank
   superficial hematoma. Cause of hematoma unclear, may be spontaneous in
   setting of INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. Another possibility may be trauma
   in the setting of delirium/agitation causing a small bleed that acutely
   worsened in setting of today
s coagulopathy. CT abdomen confirms
   hematoma is extraperitoneal. We hope it to self-tamponade.
   - IR consult for evaluation for angiography; preliminary
   recommendations include
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - Discontinue heparin IV infusion
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBCs cautiously with lasix 80mg IV in between
   - Vitamin K 2mg PO ONCE
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - Hold on diuresis given bleed
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Consider
   cerebral hypoperfusion. EEG recommended by neurology to r/o seizures
   and was negative.  Patient had 8%  bands on Differential which was
   concerning for infection so is being treated fro HAP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Improved. The patient is actually at his
   recent baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely
   etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis (AS) post aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), third-degree heart block post pacemaker placement, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient was admitted for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current conditions include acute anemia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mediastinal adenopathy, mechanical aortic valve, atrial fibrillation with single-chamber pacemaker, history of CAD post CABG, diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, and BPH.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, and there is evidence of worsening symptoms such as peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, and elevated jugular venous pressure. This condition can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and may require adjustment of diuretic therapy and consideration of vasodilator therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac surgeries. He presented with symptoms of right-sided heart failure and was transferred from another hospital for consideration of vasodilator therapy. The patient has acute anemia likely secondary to a new right flank superficial hematoma, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and possible infection. He has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, mechanical aortic valve, atrial fibrillation with single-chamber pacemaker, history of coronary artery disease after CABG, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit, indicating acute anemia. This could be due to the right flank hematoma or internal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation is necessary. Blood transfusion may be required to manage the anemia.

2. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms suggest worsening of his chronic heart failure, specifically diastolic dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload, such as increasing edema and shortness of breath, is crucial. Diuretics may need to be adjusted or held temporarily due to the recent bleeding event.

   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute anemia: Acute HCT drop likely secondary to new right flank
   superficial hematoma. Cause of hematoma unclear, may be spontaneous in
   setting of INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. Another possibility may be trauma
   in the setting of delirium/agitation causing a small bleed that acutely
   worsened in setting of today
s coagulopathy.
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - Hold on diuresis given bleed
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Consider
   cerebral hypoperfusion. EEG recommended by neurology to r/o seizures
   and was negative.  Patient had 8%  bands on Differential which was
   concerning for infection so is being treated fro HAP.  Mental status
   slightly improved overnight.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - contact neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Improved. The patient is actually at his
   recent baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely
   etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, aortic stenosis post aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting, and third-degree heart block post pacemaker placement. The patient was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current condition includes acute anemia due to a right flank superficial hematoma, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and infection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, mechanical aortic valve, atrial fibrillation with single-chamber PPM, history of CAD post CABG, diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, exacerbation of chronic kidney disease, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential infections such as pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac function, renal function, mental status, and respiratory status. Appropriate interventions should be implemented to manage the patient's conditions and prevent further complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and mechanical aortic valve. He presented with symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, infection (presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia), chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, mechanical aortic valve, atrial fibrillation with single-chamber pacemaker, history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of heart failure: The patient's symptoms of right-sided heart failure suggest that his heart failure may continue to worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but there is a concern for other sources of infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or urinary tract infection. Monitoring for fever, white blood cell count, and localizing signs of infection is crucial.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status needs to be closely monitored. Delirium can be caused by various factors, including infection, medication effects, or cerebral hypoperfusion.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute anemia: Acute HCT drop likely secondary to new right flank
   superficial hematoma. Cause of hematoma unclear, may be spontaneous in
   setting of INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. Another possibility may be trauma
   in the setting of delirium/agitation causing a small bleed that acutely
   worsened in setting of today
s coagulopathy. CT abdomen confirms
   hematoma is extraperitoneal. We hope it to self-tamponade.
   - IR consult for evaluation for angiography; preliminary
   recommendations include
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - Discontinue heparin IV infusion
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBCs cautiously with lasix 80mg IV in between
   - Vitamin K 2mg PO ONCE
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - Hold on diuresis given bleed
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Consider
   cerebral hypoperfusion. EEG recommended by neurology to r/o seizures
   and was negative.  Patient had 8%  bands on Differential which was
   concerning for infection so is being treated fro HAP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Improved. The patient is actually at his
   recent baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely
   etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and 3rd-degree heart block. He was admitted for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure. The patient's current conditions include acute anemia due to a right flank hematoma, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, mechanical aortic valve, AFib with single-chamber PPM, history of CAD post CABG, diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bandemia and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There is a concern for infection as the likely source of the altered mental status.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a right flank hematoma, which could be spontaneous or due to trauma. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially considering the elevated INR and PTT.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has skin breakdown on the lower extremities, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.

   A 13cm x 8.7 cm large collection in the right flank is between the
   external
   and transversus oblique muscle superiorly and extends into the
   potential space between the transversus and internal abdominus muscles
   where it is 5.4 cm x 9.4 cm. This contains layering of higher
   attenuation in a dependent position consistent with a hematocrit effect
   and a focal area of high attenuation in  the muscle (2.31) could be the
   origin of the hemorrhage, although difficult to  accurately determine
   this in the absence of IV contrast. The collection is  elevating the
   right retroperitoneal structures including the kidney.
   The liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands are normal. A
   small
   amount of intra-abdominal free fluid has an attenuation value of 16HU
   consistent with fluid. Moderately large bilateral nonhemorrhagic
   pleural effusions are present. The heart is enlarged, predominantly due
   to right atrial and ventricular enlargement with pacing leads in situ
   and calcification throughout the posterior descending artery.
   Degenerative changes are mild in the thoracic spine with no destructive
   or
   sclerotic bone lesions to suggest malignancy. A left hip prosthesis is
   noted.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute anemia: Acute HCT drop likely secondary to new right flank
   superficial hematoma. Cause of hematoma unclear, may be spontaneous in
   setting of INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. Another possibility may be trauma
   in the setting of delirium/agitation causing a small bleed that acutely
   worsened in setting of today
s coagulopathy. CT abdomen confirms
   hematoma is extraperitoneal. We hope it to self-tamponade.
   - IR consult for evaluation for angiography; preliminary
   recommendations include
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - Discontinue heparin IV infusion
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBCs cautiously with lasix 80mg IV in between
   - Vitamin K 2mg PO ONCE
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - Hold on diuresis given bleed
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Consider
   cerebral hypoperfusion. EEG recommended by neurology to r/o seizures
   and was negative.  Patient had 8%  bands on Differential which was
   concerning for infection so is being treated fro HAP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Improved. The patient is actually at his
   recent baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely
   etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

   Imaging: CT ABD PELVIS [**4-9**]
   A 13cm x 8.7 cm large collection in the right flank is between the
   external
   and transversus oblique muscle superiorly and extends into the
   potential space between the transversus and internal abdominus muscles
   where it is 5.4 cm x 9.4 cm. This contains layering of higher
   attenuation in a dependent position consistent with a hematocrit effect
   and a focal area of high attenuation in  the muscle (2.31) could be the
   origin of the hemorrhage, although difficult to  accurately determine
   this in the absence of IV contrast. The collection is  elevating the
   right retroperitoneal structures including the kidney.
   The liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands are normal. A
   small
   amount of intra-abdominal free fluid has an attenuation value of 16HU
   consistent with fluid. Moderately large bilateral nonhemorrhagic
   pleural effusions are present. The heart is enlarged, predominantly due
   to right atrial and ventricular enlargement with pacing leads in situ
   and calcification throughout the posterior descending artery.
   Degenerative changes are mild in the thoracic spine with no destructive
   or
   sclerotic bone lesions to suggest malignancy. A left hip prosthesis is
   noted.
   Microbiology: No growth in blood or urine.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   # Acute anemia / Flank Bleed
   Acute HCT drop likely secondary to new right flank superficial
   hematoma. Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank
   on side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the
   muscular layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Gently restart diuresis when bleed stable (mental status appears to
   suffer when difference between central venous pressure and arterial
   pressure is lessened).
   - defer right and left heart cath indefinitely
 patient cannot even
   lie flat at present.
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.

   on:[**2129-4-11**] 13:25 ------
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and third-degree heart block status post pacemaker placement. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient has been experiencing acute anemia and a right flank bleed, which is likely secondary to a new right flank superficial hematoma. The cause of the hematoma is unclear, but it may be due to bumping the flank on the side rail with an elevated INR and PTT. The hematoma is warm, inflamed, and clinically significant.

The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, presenting with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). There has been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

The patient's mental status has been altered, likely due to cardiac encephalopathy. This has improved when venous pressure is lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure is high and arterial pressure is lower. Infection may also be playing a role in the delirium.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   # Acute anemia / Flank Bleed
   Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank on
   side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the muscular
   layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.  Hct further fell from 27 to
   25, so gave another unit this a.m.
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place (one infiltrated and removed, but will be
   replaced)
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Gently continue diuresis when bleed stable (mental status appears to
   suffer when difference between central venous pressure and arterial
   pressure is lessened). Give boluses of 80 mg IV Lasix at a time.
   - Defer right and left heart cath indefinitely
 patient cannot even
   lie flat at present.
   - continue metoprolol
   - Continue to judge best physiologic status by EJ/IJ JVP. Base to mid
   neck correlates with best functioning.
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role. Hemoglobin does not correlate with mental status as
   well as JVP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe valvular systolic dysfunction, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, aortic stenosis post mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting, third-degree heart block post pacemaker placement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was admitted for exacerbation of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure.

24-hour events include fever, blood and urine cultures drawn, initiation of vancomycin therapy, administration of Lasix, transfusion of packed red blood cells, and improvement in mental status.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure ranging from 100/41 mmHg to 126/57 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm with a paced rhythm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 18 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressure of 57 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 240 mL and total output of 985 mL.

Physical examination reveals prominent jugular veins, a regular rapid rhythm with a mechanical second heart sound, an S3 gallop, and a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse whe"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   # Acute anemia / Flank Bleed
   Acute HCT drop likely secondary to new right flank superficial
   hematoma. Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank
   on side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the
   muscular layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Gently restart diuresis when bleed stable (mental status appears to
   suffer when difference between central venous pressure and arterial
   pressure is lessened).
   - defer right and left heart cath indefinitely
 patient cannot even
   lie flat at present.
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis post mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and third-degree heart block post pacemaker placement. The patient was transferred from another hospital for further management of chronic diastolic congestion heart failure.

The patient's current condition includes an exacerbation of CHF with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure, such as peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). The patient also has a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation, which may be contributing to his symptoms.

The patient has a fever of 101.8°F and has been on vancomycin, but the dose was not administered as scheduled. The pharmacy recommends changing the dose to 750 mg IV QD based on the level. The patient has been given 80 mg IV Lasix and overnight transfused 1u PRBCs for a hematocrit of 25.7%.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, carbamazepine, and spironolactone. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2129-4-9**] at 08:00 AM, and cefepime on [**2129-4-11**] at 12:08 AM. The patient is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and other cardiac medications.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.6 K/uL, a decreased hemoglobin level (Hct) of 25.7%, and an increased platelet count (Plt) of 163 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, blood glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show no new findings, and microbiology results indicate no growth. The patient's ECG also shows no new changes.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues:
1. Acute anemia/Flank bleed: The patient has developed a right flank hematoma, likely secondary to bumping the flank on the side-rail with an elevated INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. The hematoma is warm, inflamed, and clinically significant. The patient will be maintained on active type and screen, with two large bore IVs in place, and monitored closely for hemodynamic changes.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms are consistent with right-sided heart failure, and there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation. It is important to optimize hemodynamics, avoid nephroto"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   # Acute anemia / Flank Bleed
   Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank on
   side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the muscular
   layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.  Hct further fell from 27 to
   25, so gave another unit this a.m.
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place (one infiltrated and removed, but will be
   replaced)
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Gently continue diuresis when bleed stable (mental status appears to
   suffer when difference between central venous pressure and arterial
   pressure is lessened). Give boluses of 80 mg IV Lasix at a time.
   - Defer right and left heart cath indefinitely
 patient cannot even
   lie flat at present.
   - continue metoprolol
   - Continue to judge best physiologic status by EJ/IJ JVP. Base to mid
   neck correlates with best functioning.
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role. Hemoglobin does not correlate with mental status as
   well as JVP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - in contact with neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s).
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2129-4-11**] 13:26 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe valvular systolic dysfunction, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>55%), aortic stenosis post mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting, third-degree heart block post pacemaker placement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU for further management of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient's symptoms include right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure. 

During the ICU stay, the patient developed acute anemia and a hematoma on the flank. The cause of the hematoma is unclear, but it could be secondary to bumping the flank on the side-rail with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). 

The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with worsening tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's mental status is fluctuating and appears to be cardiac encephalopathy, which improves when venous pressure is lowered by diuresis and worsens when venous pressure is high and arterial pressure is lower. 

The patient has a fever and was recently treated for presumed pneumonia at the previous hospital with cefepime and linezolid. However,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and third-degree heart block. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure. The patient has several medical complications including acute anemia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, infection and fever, chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, s/p mechanical aortic valve, AFib with single-chamber PPM, h/o CAD s/p CABG, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are low, indicating acute anemia. This could be due to blood loss, possibly from a flank bleed. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

2. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient has symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. There is a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Management of fluid balance and consideration of vasodilator therapy are needed.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient"

   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   # Acute anemia / Flank Bleed
   Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank on
   side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the muscular
   layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.  Hct further fell from 27 to
   25, so gave another unit yesterday. His HCT again falls from 29 to 27.5
   now to 26.7. I suspect he is still oozing slowly by monitoring the
   HCTs, but rate of bleed has slowed as coagulopathy has improved.
   - If no stabilization of bleed after 24 hours of normal coaggs would
   call IR back
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBCs to goal HCT > 26 as HCT still unstable.
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   - Hold on diuresis, BP control, and anticoagulation until bleed
   resolves
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Would hold on diuresis for the time being as pt still seems to be
   slowly bleeding
   - Probable R heart cath tomorrow to assess RA, RV, and PA pressures to
   get a sense of how much diuresis is needed
   - hold metoprolol
   - Continue to judge best physiologic status by EJ/IJ JVP. Base to mid
   neck correlates with best functioning.
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding now given
   bleed and diuresis prior
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role. Hemoglobin does not correlate with mental status as
   well as JVP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - Pan culture today after stopping abx given recurrent fevers.
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
 last day today
   [**2129-4-12**] for an 8 day course for HAP
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   - standing nebs
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt for now, would restart as long as HCT remains stable
   for 24 hours
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for severe diastolic biventricular heart failure. The patient's recent events include a discussion about not performing a catheterization, family requests to speak with the doctor, not administering lasix due to hypernatremia, and giving D5W to correct fluid deficit. The patient has allergies to penicillins, carbamazepine, and spironolactone. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and cefepime.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Anemia/Flank Bleed: The patient has developed anemia due to blood loss, possibly from bumping his flank on the side-rail. The cause of the hematoma is unclear, but it is warm, inflamed, and in the muscular layer. The patient's Hct has been falling despite transfusions, indicating ongoing bleeding. Coagulopathy has improved, but the rate of bleed has slowed. If no stabilization of bleed after 24 hours of normal coagulation is achieved, the interventional radiology team should be called back. The patient should maintain active type and screen, have two large-bore IVs in place, transfuse 1 unit of PRBCs to a goal Hct of"

   Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank on
   side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the muscular
   layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.  Hct further fell from 27 to
   25, so gave another unit yesterday. His HCT again falls from 29 to 27.5
   now to 26.7. I suspect he is still oozing slowly by monitoring the
   HCTs, but rate of bleed has slowed as coagulopathy has improved.
   - If no stabilization of bleed after 24 hours of normal coaggs would
   call IR back
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBCs to goal HCT > 26 as HCT still unstable.
   - TID HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   - Hold on diuresis, BP control, and anticoagulation until bleed
   resolves
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Would hold on diuresis for the time being as pt still seems to be
   slowly bleeding
   - Probable R heart cath tomorrow to assess RA, RV, and PA pressures to
   get a sense of how much diuresis is needed
   - hold metoprolol
   - Continue to judge best physiologic status by EJ/IJ JVP. Base to mid
   neck correlates with best functioning.
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding now given
   bleed and diuresis prior
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role. Hemoglobin does not correlate with mental status as
   well as JVP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-5**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - Pan culture today after stopping abx given recurrent fevers.
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-5**])
 last day today
   [**2129-4-12**] for an 8 day course for HAP
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   - standing nebs
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold heparin gtt for now, would restart as long as HCT remains stable
   for 24 hours
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11652**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   # Acute anemia / Flank Bleed
   Cause of hematoma unclear, may be secondary to bumping flank on
   side-rail with INR of 1.9 and PTT of 117. It is clearly in the muscular
   layer and is warm, inflamed, clinically.  S/p 4 units PRBCs total. I
   suspect his bleeding has stabilized based on the HCTs and his corrected
   coaggulopathy.
   - Maintain active type/screen
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - Transfuse to goal HCT > 26 as HCT still unstable.
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCTs
   - Monitor hemodynamics closely
   - Hold on diuresis, BP control, and anticoagulation until bleed
   resolves
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Would hold on diuresis for the time being as pt still seems to be
   slowly bleeding
   - Probable R heart cath today to assess RA, RV, and PA pressures to get
   a sense of how much diuresis is needed
   - hold metoprolol
   - Continue to judge best physiologic status by EJ/IJ JVP. Base to mid
   neck correlates with best functioning.
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding now given
   bleed and diuresis prior
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - Would recommend restarting Coumadin today without bridge
   # Altered mental status
   Appears to be cardiac encephalopathy
 has improved when venous
   pressure lowered by diuresis and worsened when venous pressure high and
   arterial pressure lower. Infection, typical causes of delirium likely
   playing a role. Hemoglobin does not correlate with mental status as
   well as JVP.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue diuresis when Hct stable
   - Abx completed (8 day course of vanc/cefepime started [**2129-4-5**], last
   dose [**2129-4-12**]).
   # Infection and fever
   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the
   context of vomiting. Present fever likely due to hematoma.
   - Pan culture after stopping abx given recurrent fevers - still NGTD.
   - vanc, cefipime dc
d on [**2129-4-12**] after 8 day course
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   - standing nebs
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease
   Improved. The patient is actually at his recent baseline creatinine
   (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD
   The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy
   Unclear etiology, could relate to infection vs. inflammatory or
   neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have radiology review images
   in comparison to priors, as patient has multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - Hold heparin IV given bleed
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and third-degree heart block. He was admitted to the ICU for consideration of vasodilator therapy for severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

The patient's current conditions include acute anemia due to blood loss, altered mental status (not delirium), chronic diastolic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, infection and fever, chronic kidney disease, COPD, mediastinal adenopathy, and atrial fibrillation with a single-chamber pacemaker.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of heart failure symptoms, further bleeding due to the patient's coagulopathy, development of kidney injury or failure, worsening of respiratory status in the context of COPD, and potential spread of infection if the patient has pneumonia or another source of infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes transfusion to maintain an adequate hematocrit level, close monitoring of hemodynamics, holding diuretics until the bleeding resolves, and planning for a right heart catheterization to assess pressures and determine fluid status. The patient's antibiotic therapy has been completed, and cultures are pending. The plan also includes optimizing hemodynamics, avoiding nephrotoxins, and renal dosing of medications for the patient's chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the patient will continue on cardiac diet, and his glycemic control will be monitored."

   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
   The patient presented with symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart
   failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and
   elevated JVP. Weight was significantly elevated from dry weight of 151
   lbs. Of note, there has been a recent worsening in tricuspid
   regurgitation that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1004**], patient may need a degree of peripheral edema in
   order to have enough preload to maintain cardiac output. This increased
   venous pressure may mean that cerebral perfusion is worse and edema
   might occur, worsening mental status.
   - Would hold on diuresis for the time being as pt still seems to be
   slowly bleeding
   - Probable R heart cath today to assess RA, RV, and PA pressures to get
   a sense of how much diuresis is needed
   - hold metoprolol
 he may benefit without this as he is endstage and
   may benefit from the positive inotropy

   Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with cefepime and
   linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here given no
   white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia which is
   concerning for infection and patient has trended on the hypothermic
   side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given cough,
   although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt unable
   to produce sputum. Appears possible that he has aspirated in the

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the ICU with acute anemia and a large hematoma on his right flank. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, infection, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and a history of atrial fibrillation with a single-chamber pacemaker.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms of right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated jugular venous pressure indicate worsening of his heart condition. The patient may require aggressive diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload and improve cardiac output.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely due to cardiac encephalopathy, as it improves with diuresis and worsens with increased venous pressure. It is important to avoid sedating medications, monitor for signs of infection, and restart diuretics after a right heart catheterization.
3. Infection and fever: The patient has a history of pneumonia and may have aspirated in the context of vomiting. Recurrent fevers suggest ongoing infection, and cultures should be obtained to identify the causative organism. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided due to the risk of bleeding.
4. Chronic kidney disease"
