","The patient is a 20-year-old female who was admitted with an acetaminophen and benadryl overdose. She is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in her mental status after the placement of an arterial line. Her acidosis is also improving with the administration of bicarbonate and intravenous fluids.

The patient's laboratory results show a rising bilirubin level, although her ALT/AST levels are trending downwards. Her INR is stable at 1.5. Other lab results include a white blood cell count of 9.6, hematocrit of 40.5, platelet count of 388, creatinine of 0.8, and blood glucose levels ranging from 122 to 191.

The patient is being treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), famotidine, insulin sliding scale, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver function, which is indicated by the rising bilirubin level. The patient's coagulation status should continue to be monitored closely, as indicated by the stable INR. There is a concern for hypoglycemia due to the use of insulin sliding scale, so glucose levels should be monitored regularly.

The patient's anticholinergic toxicity is improving, as evidenced by the improvement in her mental status. However, the cause of her initial acidosis is still unknown, and she may require further"

The patient is a 20-year-old female who was admitted with an acetaminophen and Benadryl overdose. She is currently in the ICU, where she has had an arterial line placed. Her mental status has gradually improved, and she received 2L D5 1/2NS with bicarbonate, which helped improve her acidosis. Her liver function tests (ALT/AST) are trending downwards, although her bilirubin continues to rise. Her INR is stable at 1.5.

The patient is receiving several medications, including NAC, famotidine, insulin sliding scale, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/85 to 104/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Flowsheet data shows that she has received a total of 3,971 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 1,871 mL given intravenously. She has had a total output of 2,135 mL, including 170 mL of blood products. Her urine output is 1,360 mL, and her NG output is 170 mL. She is not on respiratory support, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 24, HCO3- of 118, BE of -18, and O2 saturation of 100%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, oriented to person and place, with clear lungs and regular heart rhythm. There is no evidence of edema or asterixis noted. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and platelet count within normal range. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and plan include monitoring liver function tests, coagulation profile, glucose levels, and neurologic status. The patient is also being evaluated for potential liver transplantation, given the severity of her condition. Psychological and social work evaluations are recommended due to the suicide attempt.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver function, development of coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and potential infections due to prolonged ICU stay."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with a history of acetaminophen overdose (APAP OD) and anticholinergic toxidrome. The patient appears to have significantly improved, with decreased myoclonic jerking. 

The assessment and plan include several points:
1. APAP OD: Transaminases are trending downward, and total bilirubin (Tbili) is climbing. Hepatology believes the patient may be well enough to be transferred to the floor today, with follow-up from transplant surgery.
2. Consults: Social worker (SW), psychiatrist (psych), and psychology are required.
3. Further tests and examinations are needed, including LFTs (liver function tests) and coagulation profile, neuro checks, removal of Nuvaring, RUQ (right upper quadrant) ultrasound, pre-transplant liver battery, and HIV screening.
4. The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, and she should continue with loose stool softeners and follow-up finger sticks.
5. FEN (presumably a medication or treatment) IVFs should be given, with NPO (nothing by mouth) status due to vomiting.
6. PPX (presumably a medication or treatment) includes famotidine and heparin subcutaneously.
7. ACCESS (presumably a team or service) includes [**Last Name (LF) 3173**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1619**].
8. CODE (presumably a medical code or alert) is confirmed with the patient's mother.
9. Contact information is provided for the patient's father and mother.
10. DISPO (presumably discharge or disposition) is currently set to ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic failure or liver damage due to APAP OD.
2. Metabolic acidosis.
3. Potential bleeding disorders due to anticoagulant therapy (heparin).
4. Psychiatric complications such as depression or anxiety related to the medical condition.
5. Infection or sepsis due to compromised immune system.
6. Gastrointestinal complications like vomiting or diarrhea.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to consider the patient's complete medical history and conduct further evaluations for accurate assessments and potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with acetaminophen overdose and anticholinergic toxidrome. The patient appears to have significantly improved, with decreased myoclonic jerking. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Anticholinergic toxidrome: The patient should have neuro checks every four hours.
- APAP OD: The patient's transaminases are trending downward, and her total bilirubin is climbing. Hepatology thinks she may be well enough to be called out to the floor today. Transplant surgery should be followed, and a consult with a social worker, psychiatrist, and psychology should be arranged. Liver function tests and coagulation studies should also be repeated every four hours. A pre-transplant liver battery and HIV follow-up are recommended per hepatology team, as well as a follow-up RUQ ultrasound.
- AG metabolic acidosis: The patient should receive loose sodium bicarbonate and follow-up finger sticks.
- Nuvaring: The patient has been using Nuvaring for birth control. A pelvic exam should be performed to remove the ring in the morning if her mental status clears.
- FEN: The patient should have IV fluids and be NPO (nothing by mouth) for now due to vomiting.
- PPX: The patient should receive famotidine and heparin subcutaneously.
- ACCESS: The patient should be accessed by [**Last Name (LF) 3173**] and [**First Name3 (LF) 1619**].
- CODE: The patient's code status is full code confirmed with her mother.
- CONTACT: The patient's contact information should include her father and mother.
- DISPO: The patient's disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver injury due to the acetaminophen overdose. This can lead to hepatic failure if not managed properly.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an AG metabolic acidosis, which indicates an accumulation of acids in the body. If left untreated, it can lead to further acidosis and potential organ damage.
3. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections. Proper infection control measures should be implemented to prevent this.
4. Thrombosis: The patient is receiving heparin prophylaxis, indicating a risk of thrombosis. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or thrombosis is important.

These are potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these complications appropriately."

","The patient is a 20-year-old female with a history of acetaminophen overdose and anticholinergic toxidrome. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition. The patient's transaminases are significantly elevated, indicating liver injury, and she also has an elevated INR and total bilirubin level, suggesting impaired liver function. An ultrasound of the abdomen reveals a ""starry hospital ward"" appearance consistent with acute hepatitis, and there are no focal liver lesions or portal vein thrombosis.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 137/74 to 138/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, increased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The results also indicate metabolic acidosis, which has since resolved, and elevated levels of lactate and lactic acid. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has been placed on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for acetaminophen overdose, and her mental status is stable. A central venous line (CVL) has been placed in anticipation of worsening coagulopathy. The patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and anticholinergic toxidrome. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurologic status is described as stable with no significant changes in mental status. 

The patient's arterial line stopped working at 12:36 PM on 12/26/2153, and a multi-lumen line was started at 6:38 PM on the same day. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR) have worsened, but the neurologic status remains stable. The patient continues to receive N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A central venous line (CVL) has been placed in anticipation of worsening coagulopathy later. Further transplant labs have been sent in anticipation of worsening.

The patient's urine output (UOP) trended down but improved with increased intravenous fluids (IVF) and bolus. The patient was started on clear liquids but is still experiencing nausea and vomiting (N/V). The liver is reported to be okay with zofran.

 POISONING / OVERDOSE, ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL, APAP)
","The patient is a 20-year-old female with a chief complaint of acetaminophen (Tylenol, APAP) overdose. The patient presented with anticholinergic toxidrome, which appears to be improving. The patient's mental status is stable, but laboratory results show worsening liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR). An arterial line was placed, and a central venous line (CVL) was anticipated due to worsening coagulopathy. The patient has been started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and is being monitored closely.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals nausea and sedation, with a pupils equal, round, and reactive to light (PERRL). The cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm (RRR). The lung examination reveals clear to bilateral auscultation (CTAB). The abdomen is soft, non-tender (NT), and non-distended (ND), with bowel sounds (BS+) present. Extremities are without"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with an acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and evidence of hepatotoxicity. The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, with deteriorating liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation parameters. To maintain access, a right internal jugular central venous line (CVL) was placed. The patient's mental status remains intact. 

The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Other ICU medications include antibiotics, which are not specified. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for worsening LFTs and coagulation issues.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 5,407 mL and output of 1,690 mL since midnight, with a total fluid input of 1,476 mL over the past 24 hours. Urine output is 1,140 mL, and there is no data on nasogastric (NG) output, stool, or drainages.

The patient is not on respiratory support, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with an acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and hepatitis. She has worsening liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile. The patient's mental status remains adequate, and urine output has improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). She is receiving N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IV, insulin sliding scale, and ondansetron. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her CVP is 9 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 5,407 mL and output of 1,690 mL. She is not receiving respiratory support.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated INR and abnormal liver enzymes suggest ongoing liver damage due to the APAP overdose. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other complications related to liver dysfunction.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's PT/PTT/INR values indicate impaired blood clotting. This increases the risk of bleeding complications if invasive procedures are required or if there is trauma.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are within normal limits at present, but close"

","The patient is a 20-year-old female with an acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and hepatitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is awake, alert, and conversant with no abnormal findings on physical examination except for mild epigastric tenderness.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, indicating hepatic injury. The patient's INR is elevated at 2.5, suggesting impaired blood clotting function. Other lab abnormalities include elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal renal function tests, such as elevated creatinine and TCO2 levels.

The patient has been placed on heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis and is receiving IV fluids, NAC, insulin sliding scale, and Zofran. The patient's urine output responded to IVF, and a central venous line was placed for access.

The patient's mental status remains adequate, and glucose levels are within normal limits. The patient's condition requires close monitoring of coagulation profile, liver function tests, glucose levels, and mental status. The patient remains critically ill in the ICU and is expected to remain there for an extended period."

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with acute liver failure, suspected acetaminophen overdose (APAP OD), and anticholinergic toxidrome. She has been stabilized, but her transaminase levels are still elevated. The patient has undergone placement of an access for potential future transplant. Her condition is being closely monitored, and she is receiving appropriate care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, indicating a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and timely correction of coagulopathy are essential to prevent bleeding complications.
2. Infection: In critically ill patients, such as those in the ICU, there is a risk of developing infections. Proper infection control measures and monitoring for signs of infection are crucial.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's acute liver failure and high transaminase levels, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of neurological status and management of ammonia levels are necessary to prevent or manage this complication.
4. Transplant rejection: Once the patient undergoes a liver transplant, there is a risk of transplant rejection. Immunosuppressive therapy will be required to prevent rejection, and close monitoring of the transplant's function is essential.
5. Multisystem organ failure: In severe cases of liver failure, other organs such as the kidneys and cardiovascular system"

","The patient is a 20-year-old female who presented with an acute overdose (OD) of acetaminophen (APAP) and anticholinergic toxidrome. The patient's condition has been improving, with improvements in tachycardia and mental status. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and has been initiated on a transplant workup due to acute hepatitis seen on right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/92 mmHg to 137/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is sedated and nauseous.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, with transaminases in the range of 4000 U/L, elevated INR and total bilirubin. Other lab values include leukocyte count of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 388 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 122 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, sodium of 142 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, magnesium of 1.6 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 2.5 mg/dL.

The patient has been placed on a transplant workup and is being monitored closely. Active type and screen has been initiated, and the patient will be monitored for bleeding and corrected coagulopathy as needed. Neurologic exams will continue to be followed, and the patient's airway will be protected. The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved.

In terms of care, the patient is receiving intravenous fluids and will advance as tolerated. Heparin is being administered subcutaneously. The patient has multiple access lines, including a 22-gauge and a 20-gauge line placed previously, and a multi-lumen line that needs to have a clip placed and removed within 24-48 hours."

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with a history of acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and hepatitis. She is currently in the ICU and is showing improvement in her INR overnight, which has decreased to 2.1 from 2.5. She is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and is also taking Mucomyst and insulin sliding scale as part of her ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 110/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her physical examination reveals clear chest, regular rhythm with no murmurs, and warm extremities without edema. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated total bilirubin, low albumin, and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine, potassium, etc.). The patient's WBC count is within normal range, but her platelet count is low. She has a history of a suicide attempt, and the plan includes transferring her to the floor, continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy, and reassessing her psychiatric condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy due to ongoing liver injury.
2. Renal dysfunction due to acute kidney injury.
3. Coagulopathy due to decreased platelet count and prolonged"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for an acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and acute hepatitis. The patient's INR has improved overnight, from 2.5 to 2.1. She is currently on heparin for DVT prophylaxis, Mucomyst, and insulin sliding scale. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 110/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for warm extremities. 

Lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated bilirubin levels, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile (PT/INR). Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures, urine toxicology screen, and abdominal ultrasound are pending. The patient remains on NPO status and will be transferred to the floor once stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient has acute hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential hepatic injury. Close monitoring of liver function and supportive care are necessary.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's PT/INR levels are elevated, indicating impaired clotting function. This increases the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring and correction of coagulation parameters are crucial.
