","The patient is a 34-year-old female admitted with anemia secondary to blood loss from vaginal bleeding, complicated by a large obstetric hemorrhage (LOC) and followed by a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, resulting in 2 liters of blood loss. The patient is currently in the ICU with hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss. 

The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, for which insulin infusion has been started. Foley catheter has been inserted, and balloon inflation will be maintained until further notice. Hematocrit (HCT) will be checked every 4 hours. The D&C procedure has been completed, and the patient's coagulation status will be monitored closely, with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) possibly needed before balloon removal. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive enteral nutrition through the oral route and will be managed for glycemic control with insulin. The patient currently has arterial and peripheral IV lines in place. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's code status is set to full code, and she will remain in the ICU for further management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female admitted to the ICU due to an unknown medical condition. The patient's HCT levels have been decreasing over the past few days, from 25.3% to 21.3%. She also has a history of allergies to penicillins and an insulin pump that needs to be restarted in the morning since the patient did not have enough insulin with her. The patient received Rhogam due to being Rh-negative, and fetal Hgb is pending. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 to 114/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 3,266 mL total in, 3,111 mL IVF, and 155 mL blood products out, with a urine output of 3,265 mL. The patient is not on respiratory support and has a normal ABG result. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, etc. Lab results show a WBC count of 8.4-8.7 K/uL, Hct levels decreasing from 25.3% to 21.3%, Plt count of 178-188 K/uL, Cr level of 0.3-0.4 mg/dL, and Glucose level of 112-85 mg/dL. Other labs, imaging, and microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, VAP, and comments on communication, code status, and disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include hypovolemia due to the decreasing HCT levels and fluid balance, hypoglycemia from the insulin therapy, infection due to the presence of allergies to antibiotics and pending lab results, and thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobilization in the ICU. Additionally, the patient's low platelet count may indicate a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   # Uterine Bleeding: Now s/p balloon insertion; deflated balloon 15ccs
   this AM and will observe x4hr and if min VB, will remove intrauterine
   foley.  Bleeding and HCTs have been stable, pt has remained HD stable.
   - HCT: 22.4 --> 22.4--> 21.3 (received 1L bolus): discussed transfusion
   with ob/gyn, they requested holding off
   - Following OB/GYN recs: pt is Rh negative, received Rhogam, Fetal Hgb
   pending. Also remains on Clindamycin (in place of Keflex given PCN
   allergy) for intrauterine foley.
   - monitoring Hct Q6H and transfuse for hct <21

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old pregnant female at 8 weeks gestation admitted with uterine bleeding. She has undergone a Bakri balloon placement and is now in the ICU for closer monitoring. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been stable, and she remains hemodynamically stable. She is Rh-negative and received Rhogam. The patient's PTT is elevated, but her INR has normalized after receiving 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She also has type 1 diabetes and is currently on an insulin infusion. The patient's arterial and venous lines were placed on 4/27/15 at 7:46 and 7:48 PM respectively. She is at code status full code and will be dispositioned in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uterine bleeding may lead to significant blood loss and anemia, requiring transfusion.
2. Coagulopathy indicated by the elevated PTT may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Type 1 diabetes management with insulin infusion poses the risk of hypoglycemia if not properly monitored.
4. The patient's arterial and venous lines may be associated with infection or thrombosis risks.
5. Prolonged immobilization in the ICU may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. NPO status may increase the risk of stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. The patient's compromised hemodynamic status may require further intervention, such as surgery or additional procedures.
8. Monitoring fetal health is crucial in a pregnant patient, and complications such as fetal distress or fetal demise may arise."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of anemia due to blood loss and uterine bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received blood transfusions to address acute bleeding. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/43 to 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia - Secondary to blood loss: The patient's anemia is a result of ongoing bleeding. It is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of active bleeding and consider further transfusions if necessary.
2. Uterine Bleeding: The underlying cause of the uterine bleeding needs to be identified and addressed to prevent further blood loss. Clindamycin has been prescribed to prevent infection associated with the bleeding.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has a history of type I diabetes. Close monitoring of glucose levels is essential, and insulin infusions are being administered for glycemic control.
4. ICU Care: The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support (NPO), glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and arterial and central venous lines for monitoring.
5. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic measures such as DVT boots, stress ulcer"
