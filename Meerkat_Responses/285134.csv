","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), aortic stenosis, heart failure (diastolic), and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient presented to the ICU somnolent and had an elevated pCO2 level of 86, indicating respiratory failure. He was previously admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature within the normal range, but an elevated heart rate (89 bpm) and low blood pressure (128/38 mmHg). His respiratory rate is increased (31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is maintained at 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. 

The patient has received various treatments including furosemide, antibiotics, and other medications. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1500 mL and output of 1175 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 325 mL. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated at 171 mg/dL, but within the acceptable range for ICU patients. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (11.4 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (22.8 g/dL), and normal platelet count (187 K/uL). Other lab results show elevated creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), potassium (5.5 mEq/L"

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo Spanish speaking woman with h/o COPD, diastolic heart failure, and
   aortic stenosis admitted with COPD exacerbation in the setting of
   probable pneumonia.
   # COPD exacerbation:
   Appears to have been triggered by nosocomial pneumonia.  Has long
   history of hypercarbia with chronic metabolic compensation, and her
   elevated CO2 most likely contributed to her poor mental status on the
   floor.  Also suspect that volume overload may be contributing to poor
   respiratory status given history of diastolic heart failure and aortic
   stenosis; she has become increasingly crackly on exam over the course
   of the day (her lasix was held this AM given concern for dehydration).
   - transfer to MICU for treatment with biPAP
   - repeat ABG to check CO2 while she is more alert
   - continue treatment of nosocomial pneumonia with vanc/zosyn/levo (day
   1 = [**9-16**])
   - continue prednisone with slow taper
   - continue nebs
   - f/u sputum Cx
   - supplemental O2 to maintain oxygen sat's in low 90s.
   # Aortic stenosis:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypoxia on admission.
   - check TTE
   - diurese with lasix as discussed below
   # Acut on Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Currently mildly volume overloaded on
   exam. Trop (-) x1. Not currently on diuretic but was previously
   discharged on Lasix 20mg PO.
   - check 2nd set of cardiac enzymes
   - lasix 10mg IV x 1 and f/u urine output for goal of -500cc
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Continue B-blocker
   # Positive UA: 3-5 WBCs, + Nitrites.

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo Spanish speaking woman with h/o COPD, diastolic heart failure, and
   aortic stenosis admitted with COPD exacerbation in the setting of
   probable pneumonia.
   # COPD exacerbation:
   Appears to have been triggered by nosocomial pneumonia.  Has long
   history of hypercarbia with chronic metabolic compensation, and her
   elevated CO2 most likely contributed to her poor mental status on the
   floor.  Also suspect that volume overload may be contributing to poor
   respiratory status given history of diastolic heart failure and aortic
   stenosis; she has become increasingly crackly on exam over the course
   of the day (her lasix was held yesterday on the floor). ABGs show pt
   with significant CO2 retention, and respiratory acidosis. Likely
   baseline, but do not have previous data at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - transfered to MICU for treatment with biPAP, though pt refused to
   wear BiPAP mask. Pt claims to be at baseline breathing status and
   comfort.
   - continue treatment of nosocomial pneumonia with vanc/zosyn/levo
   - continue prednisone at 60mg daily, will need taper on floor or when
   d/c
   - continue nebs
   - f/u sputum Cx
   - supplemental O2 to maintain oxygen sat's in low 90s.
   - Pt likely CO2 retainer and acidotic at baseline.
   - Important to determine documentation of baseline pulmonary function
   and pCO2.
   # Aortic stenosis:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypoxia on admission.
   - check TTE to assess severity and likely degree of preload/rate
   control dependence,  to guide diuresis and fluid management
   # Acut on Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Currently mildly volume overloaded on

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and is now in the ICU. The patient has been somnolent, with an elevated pCO2 level of 86, indicating CO2 retention and respiratory acidosis. She has developed crackles at the bases of her lungs bilaterally and shows signs of volume overload. The patient has also shown confusion and an altered mental status. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/38 to 95/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been treated with biPAP, but refused to wear the mask. She is receiving antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia, prednisone, nebulizers, and supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is already being treated for nosocomial pneumonia with antibiotics. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation appears to have been triggered by the nosocomial pneumonia. It is important to manage her airway and respiratory status with supplemental oxygen,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo Spanish speaking woman with h/o COPD, diastolic heart failure, and
   aortic stenosis admitted with COPD exacerbation in the setting of
   probable pneumonia.
   # COPD exacerbation:
   Appears to have been triggered by nosocomial pneumonia.  Has long
   history of hypercarbia with chronic metabolic compensation, and her
   elevated CO2 most likely contributed to her poor mental status on the
   floor.  Also suspect that volume overload may be contributing to poor
   respiratory status given history of diastolic heart failure and aortic
   stenosis; she has become increasingly crackly on exam over the course
   of the day (her lasix was held yesterday on the floor). ABGs show pt
   with significant CO2 retention, and respiratory acidosis. Likely
   baseline, but do not have previous data at [**Hospital1 54**]. Pt was transfered to
   MICU for treatment with biPAP, but refused to wear BiPAP mask. Pt
   claims to be at baseline breathing status and comfort level.
   - continue treatment of nosocomial pneumonia with vanc/zosyn/levo
   - continue prednisone at 60mg daily, will need taper on floor or when
   d/c
   - continue nebs
   - supplemental O2 to maintain oxygen sat's in low 90s. Pt on 3L O2 at
   home.
   - Pt likely CO2 retainer and acidotic at baseline, will attempt to find
   OSH hx of baseline pulmonary function and pCO2.
   # Aortic stenosis:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypoxia on admission.
   - check TTE to assess severity and likely degree of preload/rate
   control dependence,  to guide diuresis and fluid management
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Currently mildly volume overloaded
   on exam. Trop (-) x2. Not currently on diuretic but was previously
   discharged on Lasix 20mg PO.  Diuresed well to 10mg IV lasix for last 2
   days.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Continue B-blocker
   # Positive UA: 3-5 WBCs, + Nitrites, w/ repeat UA negative for
   infection, but pt well covered by PNA regimen regardless
   # Seizure Hx: Cont Phenytoin
   # DM: Stable
   - Cont ISS
   # FEN: Hyperkalemia yesterday of 5.5, treated w/ kayexalate 30mg PO x
   2, with improvement to 4.5 today. Continue to follow lytes. PO diet
   Cardiac Heart Healthy and diabetic diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), aortic stenosis, heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), history of seizure, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of COPD and acute decompensated heart failure.

24-hour events include the addition of BNP, which was elevated at 1486. The patient did not have time for obtaining OSH records. The patient received doses of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Infusions and other medications are documented, but specific details are not provided. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring data are provided, showing stable temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows an input of 1030 mL and output of 1267 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 237 mL.

ABG results are also documented, showing a pH of 7.45. Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other body systems.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo Spanish speaking woman with h/o COPD, diastolic heart failure, and
   aortic stenosis admitted with COPD exacerbation in the setting of
   probable pneumonia.
   # COPD exacerbation:
   Appears to have been triggered by nosocomial pneumonia.  Has long
   history of hypercarbia with chronic metabolic compensation, and her
   elevated CO2 most likely contributed to her poor mental status on the
   floor.  Also suspect that volume overload may be contributing to poor
   respiratory status given history of diastolic heart failure and aortic
   stenosis; she has become increasingly crackly on exam over the course
   of the day (her lasix was held yesterday on the floor). ABGs show pt
   with significant CO2 retention, and respiratory acidosis. Likely
   baseline, but do not have previous data at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - transfered to MICU for treatment with biPAP, though pt refused to
   wear BiPAP mask. Pt claims to be at baseline breathing status and
   comfort.
   - continue treatment of nosocomial pneumonia with vanc/zosyn/levo
   - continue prednisone at 60mg daily, will need taper on floor or when
   d/c
   - continue nebs
   - f/u sputum Cx
   - supplemental O2 to maintain oxygen sat's in low 90s.
   - Pt likely CO2 retainer and acidotic at baseline.
   - Important to determine documentation of baseline pulmonary function
   and pCO2.
   # Aortic stenosis:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypoxia on admission.
   - check TTE to assess severity and likely degree of preload/rate
   control dependence,  to guide diuresis and fluid management
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Currently mildly volume overloaded
   on exam. Trop (-) x2. Not currently on diuretic but was previously
   discharged on Lasix 20mg PO.  Diuresed well to 10mg IV lasix yesterday.
   - lasix 10mg IV x 1 again, and monitor PULM exam, O2 sats, and UOP
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Continue B-blocker
   # Positive UA: 3-5 WBCs, + Nitrites.
   - resend urine Cx,
   - covered for UTI by Abx for PNA
   # Seizure Hx: Cont Phenytoin
   # DM: Stable
   - Cont ISS
   # FEN: Kayexelate for hyperkalemia; repeat K+ tonight; Replete lytes
   PRN/Cardiac Heart Healthy and diabetic diet
   # Access: PIV
   # Full Code
   # Disp:  ICU for now, possibly c/o to floor this afternoon if baseline
   pCO2 can be obtained.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking woman with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with a COPD exacerbation and probable pneumonia. Her current condition includes respiratory acidosis with elevated CO2 levels, crackles on exam, and potential volume overload. She is being treated for nosocomial pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is already being treated for this condition.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient is being treated with biPAP, nebs, and antibiotics.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient is being managed with diuretics and medication adjustments.
4. Aortic stenosis: Further assessment and management are needed to address this condition.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine analysis showed 3-5 WBCs and positive nitrites, indicating a possible UTI.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is being managed with Kayexelate.
7. Seizure history: The patient has a history of seizures, and phenytoin is being continued for seizure prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), aortic stenosis, heart failure (diastolic), a previous seizure, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD and is being treated with prednisone and antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient also has hyperkalemia with an unclear etiology, which is suspected to be medication-related. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to an acute exacerbation of COPD. This condition can worsen if not properly managed with appropriate medications and respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia. If the infection spreads or does not respond to treatment, it may lead to further complications.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient is experiencing hyperkalemia, which is an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood. If left untreated, it can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other serious complications.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, a heart valve condition that can lead to heart failure and other complications if not managed properly.
