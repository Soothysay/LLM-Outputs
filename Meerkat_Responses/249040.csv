   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan showed distended gallbladder with
   gallstones.  WBC count and bilirubin rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   - if tachycardia does not resolve after ERCP, low threshold for placing
   central line and monitoring CVP
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs not concerning
   - monitor INR
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - start stress dose IV steroids as pt unable to continue taking POs
   - will discuss with GI about restarting home 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

The patient's WBC count and bilirubin are rising, and her LFTs are also elevated. The plan is to trend LFTs, WBC, and lactate levels. ERCP will be performed first thing in the morning. Surgical consultation is ongoing.

The patient has an INR of 2.0 on presentation, which may be due to nutritional deficiencies or consumptive coagulopathy. She has received IV vitamin K and FFP. DIC labs are not concerning, so the INR will be monitored.

The patient has guaiac positive stools, most likely due to her known Crohn's disease. However, ischemic colitis, ulcers, or other gastrointestinal bleeding etiologies are also possible. The patient is refusing an NG tube. Hem"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient remains with abdominal pain, which has improved with pain management medications. He required one dose of hydralazine overnight for hypertension and continues to have tachycardia. The patient is more awake this morning but remains appropriate. He has a history of allergies to E-Mycin and unknown allergies. The patient received antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam) within the last 24 hours. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 138/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,107 mL and output of 1,820 mL. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and frail build. The patient has no jugular venous distention, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes,"

   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Respiratory Failure
 Patient was intubated for ERCP yesterday.  Plan
   to extubate once pain control and agitation are better controlled.
   Patient is hypertensive this morning likely due to agitation
   - extubate today once pain under control and patient is less
   hypertensive
   - hydralazine IV x 1 to control hypertension
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  T bili elevated this AM, 4.8
 8.9.  ERCP
   was notified, they are of the opinion that she likely clotted again,
   but they want to wait until after she
s stopped bleeding before they
   repeat ERCP.
   - fractionate bili
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - f/u culture data
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 100 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP, INR 1.3 today.  DIC labs are not concerning.
   - monitor INR daily
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - consult GI regarding steroid dosing and restarting 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, cholecystitis, and short gut syndrome. She presents with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. The patient was intubated for ERCP yesterday and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has experienced several medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stools, which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. The likely etiology is her known Crohn's disease, but other possibilities such as ischemic colitis, ulcers, or other gastrointestinal bleeding sources should also be considered. The patient is refusing an NG tube, and her hematocrit levels are currently stable.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient initially had an elevated INR of 2.0 on presentation, which was partially corrected with vitamin K and FFP. The etiology of the coagulopathy is unclear but may be related to nutritional deficiencies or consumptive coagulopathy. Monitoring of INR is recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for ERCP yesterday and is planned to be extubated once pain control and agitation are better controlled. The patient is hypertensive, likely due to agitation, and will be given hydralazine IV to control hypertension before extubation.

4. Abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes: The patient's T-bili is elevated, indicating possible cholestasis"

   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan showed distended gallbladder with
   gallstones.  WBC count and bilirubin rising.

   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   - if tachycardia does not resolve after ERCP, low threshold for placing
   central line and monitoring CVP
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs not concerning
   - monitor INR
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and short gut syndrome. She presented with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. The patient had an ERCP procedure recently, which may have caused stent occlusion or sludge accumulation. Her abdominal pain is concerning for ischemic bowel, obstruction, perforation, abscess, or biliary/peritoneal fistula. The patient's WBC count and bilirubin levels are rising. She has a history of cholecystitis and open cholecystostomy tube placement. She has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management. Her INR is elevated, and she has guaiac positive stools. The patient is currently unable to take oral medications and has a port for access. The surgical team is co-managing her care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stent occlusion or sludge accumulation after ERCP
2. Ischemic bowel
3. Obstruction
4. Perforation
5. Abscess
6. Biliary/peritoneal fistula
7. Nutritional deficiencies leading to coagulopathy
8. Consumptive coagulopathy (DIC)

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and experienced bleeding from the biliary tree, resulting in the extraction of large clots. The patient received a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (prbc) and remains intubated post-ERCP.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 37.2 C (98.9 F)
- Heart rate (HR): 70 bpm
- Blood pressure (BP): 105/46 mmHg
- Respiratory rate (RR): 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 100%

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 420 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube.

The patient has a history of cholecystitis, calculous, Crohn's disease, and previous surgeries. The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Anemia, other: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, which indicates anemia. Further evaluation and management are required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, ileostomy, short gut syndrome, cholecystitis, and ERCP with stent placement. She presented with respiratory failure but has since resolved and was extubated yesterday. She also has GPC bacteremia, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, guaiac positive stools, and Crohn's disease. The patient is currently on RA, refusing NGT, and unable to take PO medications due to short gut syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has an identified bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci (GPC), which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing inflammatory process in the abdomen. This could potentially be related to Crohn's disease or another underlying cause such as ischemic colitis or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated INR, indicating a bleeding tendency. This could be due to nutritional deficiencies associated with short gut syndrome or consumptive coagulopathy. Close monitoring of INR and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Guaiac Positive Stools: The presence of guaiac positive stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source and"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure
 Patient was extubated yesterday.  Did well on NC
   without desaturations.
   .
   #[**Name (NI) **] Bacteremia
 pt does not meet SIRS/sepsis criteria as she is
   afebrile, normal and RR and HR. She does have leukocytosis. Given
   possibility for Pseudonomas (although E. coli more likely), switched
   from Unasyn to Zosyn.
   -Should we double-cover with ciprofloxacin as well?
   .
   #Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  T bili elevated this AM, 4.8
 8.9.
   ERCP was notified, they are of the opinion that she likely clotted
   again, but they want to wait until after she
s stopped bleeding before
   they repeat ERCP.
   - fractionate bili
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - f/u culture data
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 100 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   .
   #Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP, INR 1.3 today.  DIC labs are not concerning.
   - monitor INR daily
    .
   #Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
    .
   #Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - consult GI regarding steroid dosing and restarting 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease and multiple abdominal surgeries.
- She presented with worsening abdominal pain and nausea.
- The patient was extubated yesterday and did well on nasal cannula without desaturations.
- Her WBC count has been elevated, indicating possible infection or inflammation.
- The patient has leukocytosis and an elevated T-bili level, suggesting biliary sepsis.
- She also has fractionated bilirubin, elevated LFTs, and increased alkaline phosphatase, indicating possible liver dysfunction.
- The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a coagulopathy that could be due to nutritional deficiencies or consumptive coagulopathy.
- She has guaiac positive stools, which could be due to Crohn's disease or other gastrointestinal bleeding causes.
- The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires nutritional support.
- She has an indwelling port for medication administration and is on prophylactic medications for DVT and stress ulcers.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on nasal cannula. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has leukocytosis and elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, ileostomy, short gut syndrome, and cholelithiasis who presented with pre-sepsis due to recurrent biliary obstruction. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed clot and bleeding from the biliary tree. The patient remains intubated post-ERCP. 

The patient's current issues include biliary obstruction, leukocytosis, blood loss anemia, bleeding from the biliary tree, GNR/staph bacteremia, tachycardia, Crohn's disease, and a history of cholecystitis with calculi. The stent has been removed, and her white blood cell count remains elevated but stable, possibly related to infection and stress steroids. She is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn, awaiting sensitivities. The possibility of an infected port will be discussed with surgery, and there will be a low threshold for double PSA coverage if there is a clinical decline. The patient's bilirubin levels are slowly decreasing, and plans will be made for a repeat ERCP procedure with possible stent replacement once bleeding has stabilized. Liver function tests will be trended, and the patient will continue to receive active T and C, follow hcts with a goal hct of 25. Coagulopathy may be related to nutritional deficiencies in short gut syndrome, which has been corrected. T"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and cholelithiasis. She presented with sepsis and biliary obstruction. She has undergone multiple abdominal surgeries and has an ileostomy. The patient's recent medical history includes recurrent biliary obstruction, blood loss anemia, and GNR/staph bacteremia. She was previously on unasyn and vancomycin, but now she is on zosyn and vancomycin, awaiting sensitivities. The patient's condition is stable, and she is responding well to the current regimen. However, there is a possibility of an infected port given the presence of staph infection. The patient's tachycardia and hypertension have resolved. Her coagulopathy has been corrected, and her white blood cell count remains elevated. The patient's bilirubin levels are slowly decreasing, indicating improvement in her biliary obstruction. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving maintenance IV fluids. She will undergo further evaluation and management by the surgical team.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of GNR/staph bacteremia, and there is a concern for an infected port. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
2. Biliary obstruction: The patient has recurrent biliary obstruction due to multiple factors such as stones and clot formation. This can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
