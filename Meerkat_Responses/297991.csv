 CAD s/p bypass:
   Has SSCP when lies back.None currently however severe anemia could
   excacerbate ischemia. EKG at admission showed deepened T waves in
   precordial leads compared to ED and 8/7/9 (read as consistent with
   ischemia). CE have been trending up, with Trop up to 1.23 today in the
   setting of ESRD with Cr of 9.1.  Cards fellow called and EKGs sent,
   feels this is still related to anemia on presentation augmented by
   ESRD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with melanotic stools since starting dialysis and was found to have a lesion in the GI tract susceptible to bleeding. He is currently on Plavix for his CAD and receives heparin flushes from dialysis, which may have contributed to the bleeding.

The patient has a fever of 101.9, likely due to infection, possibly pneumonia if aspirated during EGD or bacteremia seeded during EGD or urinary tract infection. The patient's EKG shows ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6, which are minimally changed from admission EKG but new since 08/07/15. This suggests possible ischemia.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. The white blood cell count is within normal range, but the platelet count is low at 63 K/uL. The creatinine level is elevated at 9.1 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. Troponin T levels are also elevated, suggesting cardiac involvement.

The patient has several medical conditions, including ESRD, CAD, gastrointestinal bleed, fever, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The assessment and plan include managing the GI bleed, treating the fever, monitoring cardiac status, restarting home"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing melanotic stools since starting dialysis, which suggests gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The combination of being on Plavix and heparin flushes from dialysis, along with uremic platelets, may have contributed to the development of a lesion in the GI tract susceptible to bleeding.

The patient's EKG shows ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6, which are minimally changed from the admission EKG but new since [**2140-7-8**] EKG. These findings indicate possible cardiac ischemia.

The patient has also been experiencing a persistent low-grade temperature since admission, with a spike to 101.9 today. This could be due to infection, possibly pneumonia if aspirated during EGD or bacteremia seeded during EGD, or a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and troponin-T levels. The WBC count is trending upward, indicating an ongoing infection. The Hct level is elevated, suggesting ongoing bleeding or blood transfusions. The troponin-T level is significantly increased, indicating cardiac injury.

The patient has multiple medical comorbidities, including ESRD, coronary artery"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent an endoscopy to identify the source of the GI bleed, which is suspected to be from an upper source with ulcerations. Pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion was initiated to manage the GI bleed. The patient's cardiac enzymes are rising, indicating ongoing cardiac injury, but there is no ongoing active ischemia on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient has a known history of two previous myocardial infarctions, and the troponin levels are elevated. Plavix and statin medications were withheld due to the GI bleed. The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodialysis (HD) today. The patient developed a fever, with a maximum temperature of 101.9°F. The source of the fever is unclear, and further investigations including chest X-ray and urinalysis are planned. A pan-culture including the hemodialysis line was ordered, and vancomycin was administered due to a malfunctioning hemodialysis line. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a blood pressure of 132/59 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with no edema observed. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed and NSTEMI. The patient has a history of renal failure, stage 5 chronic kidney disease (ESRD), and previous myocardial infarction. On admission, the patient presented with fever, ongoing GI bleed, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Endoscopy was performed to identify the source of the GI bleed, which is likely from an upper source with ulcerations. The patient has been receiving pantoprazole (PPI) to manage the GI bleed, and an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy are planned for Monday. The patient's NSTEMI was managed with Plavix, but the troponin levels are trending down. The patient continues to be monitored for any signs of ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - Upper GI bleed: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding likely from an upper source with ulcerations. Continued management with pantoprazole (PPI) is recommended to reduce acid secretion and protect the gastric mucosa. Further diagnostic procedures like EGD and colonoscopy may be required to identify the exact source of bleeding and guide appropriate treatment.
   
2. Cardiac Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed and NSTEMI. The patient underwent an endoscopy to identify the source of the GI bleed and an EKG to assess for cardiac ischemia. The patient is experiencing persistent rising cardiac enzymes, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient also has a fever of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate between 85-98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/48 mmHg to 163/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged since admission.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,339 mL and total output of 1,750 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 589 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous infusion and is being monitored for respiratory support.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of hemoglobin (9.8 g/dL), hematocrit (29.8%), leukocytes (11.4 K/uL), and platelets (63 K/uL). Kidney function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels (9.1 mg/dL), while cardiac biomarkers show elevated troponin-T levels (1.23 ng/mL). Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presents with melanotic stools since starting dialysis.
- Patient is on Plavix for a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and there is a concern about the combination of being on Plavix and heparin flushes from dialysis, along with uremic platelets revealing a lesion in the GI tract susceptible to bleeding.
- The patient has a fever of 102.3°F and an unknown origin.
- The patient experienced shortness of breath while undergoing hemodialysis and resolved by sitting up.
- Hematocrit (HCT) levels have been fluctuating, with the lowest being 27% and the highest being 29.3%.
- Troponin levels have been elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement.
- The patient has thrombophlebitis in the left arm.
- The patient's allergies are unchanged from admission.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin for an infection.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/64 mmHg to 147/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.
- The patient's weight is 101.5 kg.
- Fluid balance shows a negative balance of -4,679 mL since 12 AM.
- The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen, but not on mechanical ventilation.
- Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for the presence of thrombophlebitis in the left arm.
- Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and potassium levels. The platelet count is also low.
- Imaging shows a cardiac silhouette that is within normal limits and no signs of consolidation or pneumothoraces.
- Microbiology reports indicate positive MRSA screen and H. pylori antibody.
- The patient has a history of renal failure, fever of unknown origin, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The gastrointestinal bleed is suspected to be caused by a lesion in the GI tract, possibly due to ulcer, gastritis, esophageal varices, AVM, diverticulosis, diverticulitis, colon polyp, or colon cancer. No new bleeding has occurred since admission.
- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed thick gastric folds, erythema in the pylorus, ulcers in the antrum and pylorus, and ulcers in the first part of the duodenum. No blood was seen during the procedure.
- The patient is currently on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and clear liquids. It is uncertain whether he can resume a regular diet or continue with clear liquids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). He is experiencing melanotic stools since starting dialysis, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding caused by a lesion in the GI tract susceptible to bleeding, possibly related to being on Plavix and heparin flushes from dialysis. The patient also has a fever of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and his blood cultures are pending. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and gout. His vital signs include a temperature of 39.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's HCT has been dropping to 27, and he has a creatinine level of 9.1 mg/dL. The EGD showed thick gastric folds, erythema in the pylorus, ulcers in the antrum and pylorus, and ulcers in the first part of the duodenum. The patient's cardiac silhouette is within normal limits on the chest X-ray, and there are no signs of consolidation or pneumothoraces. The patient's platelet function is being evaluated, and desmopressin has been given. The patient is currently on clears and will continue with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), two previous myocardial infarctions (MI), and is currently experiencing fever of unknown origin (FUO), likely due to a hospital-acquired infection. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate within normal range, slightly low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 96%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine level of 7.5 mg/dL indicating kidney dysfunction, and elevated troponin-T levels suggesting myocardial injury. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels are within normal range.

The physical examination reveals the patient to be alert and lying in bed, with diminished breath sounds in the chest and soft abdomen without any signs of edema. An image of the patient's chest X-ray is mentioned but not provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of ESRD with hemodialysis, treatment for NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) by holding Plavix and aspirin, and continuing pantoprazole for GI bleed. The source of the GI bleed is suspected to be from an upper source with ulcerations, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient presents with gastrointestinal bleed.
- Patient has a history of renal failure, specifically end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
- The patient has a fever of 102.3°F.
- Vital signs include a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/50 to 147/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix) and vancomycin.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,121 mL total, with 690 mL through the oral route, 431 mL through intravenous fluids, and 410 mL through total parenteral nutrition. The output includes 4,600 mL of blood products, 1,400 mL of urine, and 550 mL of stool. The negative fluid balance is 3,479 mL.
- The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 195 K/uL, platelet count of 91 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 7.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 25 mEq/L, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride level of 100 mEq/L, glucose level of 91 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.5, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 25 mEq/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 28.3%.
- The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray taken on 07/15/2140 at 12:01 PM, 03:43 PM, 10:43 PM, and subsequent days.
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count ranges from 6.8 to 11.4 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) ranges from 27.4 to 29.8%, and platelet count ranges from 95 to 130 K/uL. Other lab results include elevated levels of creatinine and troponin-T, as well as normal levels of calcium and magnesium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. The source of the infection needs to be identified and treated accordingly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently showing elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications and fluids will be necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not managed promptly. Monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment of bleeding are essential.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's maximum temperature of 39.1°C (102.3°F) suggests a risk of hyperthermia. It is important to monitor the patient's temperature regularly and take appropriate measures to manage it.

   57  y/o male with hx ESRD with melanotic stools since starting
   dialysis. On plavix for hx CAD, and given timing of symptoms with
   dialysis possible that combination of being on plavix and heparin
   flushes from dialysis + uremic platelets revealed a lesion in his GI
   tract susceptible to bleeding. No signs active bleed, no stool x
   several days. Possible etiologies of such a lesion include ulcer (no
   pain), gastritis, esophageal varices (no alcohol hx),esophageal Ca(no
   dysphagia), AVM, diverticulosis, diverticulitis (llq pain), colon
   polyp, colon ca.  No new bleeding since admission. Desmopressin given

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and anemia. The patient has been experiencing melanotic stools since starting dialysis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/50 to 150/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but not using supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 180 mL since midnight. The laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.1%. The white blood cell count is within normal range. The platelet count is slightly low at 263,000/mm³. Renal function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels. The troponin-T levels are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury.

The patient has a history of CAD and is on Plavix. The presence of melanotic stools since starting dialysis, along with the use of Plavix and heparin flushes from dialysis, raises the possibility of a bleeding lesion in the gastrointestinal tract.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with ESRD, CAD on plavix with melanotic stools since
   starting dialysis who presents with GIB and anemia
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   57 y/o male with hx ESRD with melanotic stools since starting dialysis.
   On plavix for hx CAD, and given timing of symptoms with dialysis
   possible that combination of being on plavix and heparin flushes from
   dialysis + uremic platelets revealed a lesion in his GI tract
   susceptible to bleeding. No signs active bleed, no stool x several
   days. Possible etiologies of such a lesion include ulcer (no pain),
   gastritis, esophageal varices (no alcohol hx),esophageal Ca(no
   dysphagia), AVM, diverticulosis, diverticulitis (llq pain), colon
   polyp, colon ca.  No new bleeding since admission. Desmopressin given
   for plt function. Hct stable
   EGD Friday showed: Thick gastric folds.  Erythema in the pylorus.
   Ulcers in the antrum and pylorus.  Ulcers in the first part of the
   duodenum.  No blood seen, there was clear bile.  Biopsy not performed
   since pt is on Plavix.
   - 2 PIVs, Type and crossmatched
   - Appreciate GI recs, colonoscopy today, EGD with biopsy, pt was NPO
   and bowel preped
   - transfuse to goal HCT> 28
   - check HCT q12h
   - trend coags
   - On PPI IV BID
   .
 FEVER Patient with persistent low grade temp since admission.
   Afebrile today. Likely due to infection, possible PNA if aspirated
   during EGD vs bacteremia which was seeded during EGD vs UTI.  Given
   tylenol for fever, blood cx x2 p, urine cx p, MRSA screen P, H.Pylori
   ab p. Afebrile past 24h.
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc dosed with HD
   - tylenol for fever
   - continue to monitor temp
   .
 CAD s/p bypass: HaD SSCP when lies back.None currently however severe
   anemia could excacerbate ischemia. EKG at admission showed deepened T
   waves in precordial leads compared to ED and 8/7/9 (read as consistent
   with ischemia). CE have been trending up, with Trop up to 1.23 today in
   the setting of ESRD with Cr of 9.1.  Cards fellow called and EKGs sent,
   feels this is still related to anemia on presentation augmented by
   ESRD.
   - nuclear stress as outpatient or during admission
   - continue to hold Plavix, no ASA in setting of recent GIB
   - restarted carvedilol dose
   .
 HTN:
   - restarted home carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Monitor BPs.
