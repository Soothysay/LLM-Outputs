","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list, esophageal varices, and gastric/esophageal ulcers. He was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation of a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated for airway protection. He has multiple complications including GI bleed, ESLD, respiratory issues, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), pneumonia (PNA), portal vein thrombosis (PVT), thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, prolonged QT interval, and hypophosphatemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers, which are likely contributing to the ongoing upper GI bleed. There is ongoing bleeding with portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient is receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, and zosyn empiric for the GI bleed. The plan is to continue these medications and monitor for any signs of re-bleeding.

2. ESLD: The patient's liver disease is complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy. The MELD score is 24, indicating severe liver disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list. He was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation of a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has multiple medical complications including GI bleed likely caused by esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and elevated INR. He also has ESLD complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is being treated with octreotide, pantoprazole, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for the GI bleed. ESLD management includes holding beta-blocker nadolol, initiating lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and consulting with a liver specialist. Metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis are also present. The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Pneumonia is suspected with a collapsed left lung and questionable infiltrate in the right middle lobe. Empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration is being given. Portal vein thrombosis has been documented previously and anticoagulation is contraindicated. Th"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's chief complaint is unchanged.
- Vancomycin was changed to [**Hospital1 **], and no change in OSH cultures was observed.
- Nutrition consultation resulted in the initiation of tube feeds.
- Liver recommendations include increasing rifaximin, continuing lactulose, changing PPI to [**Hospital1 **], continuing octreotide gtt until [**2145-9-5**] at 1 PM, repeating abdominal ultrasound (abdominal U/S) to assess the patency of the portal system, and if creatinine (Cr) stable, planning for an MRI. If the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) are thrombosed, the patient may not be a transplant candidate.
- The abdominal U/S was completed.
- Hematocrit (Hct) level is 27.7.
- Sedation has been turned off, but the patient remains somnolent.

   57 yo M with PMHx of alcoholic ESLD on transplant list, esophageal
   varices transferred from [**Hospital1 1195**] for further evaluation of TIPs procedure
   after GI bleed.
   # GI Bleed: Likely upper given history of esophageal varices and
   gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site. Also contributing with
   portal hypertensive gastropathy oozing in setting of elevated INR.
   -octreotide gtt remains on
   -protonix gtt remains on
   - q8h hct, xfuse hct<25
   - Cordis for access, replaced yesterday
   - trend INR, keep INR <2 with FFP or active bleeding, redose 10mg IV
   vitamin K x1 today
   - fibrinogen < 100
 cryoprecipitate
   - NPO
   - carafate
   - zosyn empiric for GI bleed
   # ESLD: Complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy.
   Diagnosic para negative for SBP. Liver U/S without portal venous flow.
   MELD 24
   - hold nadolol given GI bleed
   - continue rifaxamin and lactulose
   -appreciate liver input
   - for encephalopathy, started rifaximin, lactulose.
   # Respiratory: Intubated for protection of airway
   - will extubate today
   - shut off sedation
   # Met acidosis: AG and non AG based on deltadelta of 0.7. Lactate Also
   patient likely has baseline respiratory alkalosis.
   -repeat lactate
   # ARF: doubt this is HRS given improvement, no need for more saline
   - continue colloid as needed per liver team
   # PNA: Has CXR with LLL collapse and questionable infiltrate in R
   middle lobe. ? Aspiration with intubation. Sputum Cx from OSH with GPC
   in pairs.
   - empiric coverage VAP/aspiration with Vanc/Zosyn
 will likely d/c
   vanc tomorrow if continues to be afebrile
   - f/u sputum culture from OSH
   .
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Documented at OSH and previous ultrasounds at
   [**Hospital1 1**]. Given recent GIB anticoagulation contraindicated.
   -monitor LFTs
   .
   # Thombocytopenia: Previous baseine 50-60s. Received 1 units of
   platelets.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse if active bleeding or plt < 50
   # Elevated INR: Likely [**1-4**] liver disease and coagulopathy given recent
   bleeds. INR 1.5. No current signs of bleeding admission or oozing from
   IVs. FDP elevated.
   - f/u fibrinogen replace <100
   - trend INR
   # prolonged QT: Borderline on previous EKGs here. Noted on admission
   EKG.
   -avoid meds that could prolong QT more

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list, who was transferred from Hospital1 for further evaluation of TIPS procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- The patient is currently intubated for protection of the airway and is expected to be extubated today.
- He has been started on tube feeds and is receiving octreotide, carafate, and zosyn empirically for the GI bleed.
- The patient's liver disease is complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy, with a MELD score of 24.
- He is also diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, prolonged QT interval, and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring, including liver function tests, coagulation profile, platelet count, and frequent reassessment of his vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This can be indicated by changes in mental status, such as confusion or altered level of consciousness. Monitoring for signs of encephalopathy and ensuring adherence to lactulose and rifaximin therapy is crucial.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, likely due to esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers. Close monitoring for any signs of rebleeding or ongoing bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and esophageal varices. He was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's current condition includes GI bleeding likely due to esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and elevated INR. Other complications include ESLD with variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory issues requiring intubation, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), possible pneumonia with aspiration, portal vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, prolonged QT interval, and repletion of electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers, which can lead to recurrent bleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: ESLD can cause mental status changes and confusion.
3. Pneumonia: The patient may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
4. ARF: Acute kidney injury can occur in patients with ESLD, especially if there is hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has a documented"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was transferred from Hospital1 for further evaluation of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has been diagnosed with esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site. The patient is currently intubated for protection of airway and sedation has been turned off for 24 hours. He is also on octreotide gtt until September 5th at 1 PM. The patient's current condition includes cirrhosis, ascites, cholelithiasis, portal vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, and prolonged QT interval. His MELD score is 22.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers increases the risk of further GI bleeding.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's ESLD, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and confusion.
3. Portopulmonary Hypertension: The patient's portal hypertension may lead to the development of portopulmonary hypertension, a condition characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries.
4. Hepatoportal Syst"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list, admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of TIPS procedure after a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is intubated for airway protection, sedation has been off for 48 hours without improvement in mental status. The patient's breathing pattern is irregular and requires mandatory minute volume (MMV) mode overnight after being on assist-control ventilation (ACV) all day. There are concerns about extubation if the patient's mental status clears.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory: The patient is intubated due to the risk of aspiration and airway protection. The irregular breathing pattern requires MMV mode to ensure adequate ventilation. Extubation may be considered if the patient's mental status improves.
2. GI Bleed: The patient likely had an upper GI bleed given the history of esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site. Portal hypertensive gastropathy may also contribute to ongoing bleeding in the setting of elevated INR.
3. ESLD: The patient's ESLD is complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Liver ultrasound without portal venous flow is noted. The patient has a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 22.
4. ARF: Acute renal failure (ARF) resolved after albumin and intravenous fluids (IVFs) administration.
5. PNA: The patient has pneumonia with a chest X-ray showing left lower lobe (LLL) collapse and questionable infiltrate in the right middle lobe. Aspiration with intubation is suspected. Empiric coverage with Zosyn is given based on sputum culture results.
6. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient has documented portal vein thrombosis at the outside hospital (OSH) and previous ultrasounds at Hospital1. Anticoagulation is contraindicated due to recent GI bleeding.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had a previous baseline platelet count of 50-60s and received one unit of platelets. Platelet transfusion is considered if active bleeding or platelet count is below 50.
8. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR likely due to liver disease and coagulopathy. INR is monitored, and fibrinogen replacement is considered if below 100.
9. Prolonged QT: The patient has a borderline prolonged QT interval on previous EKGs. Medications that could further prolong QT are avoided, and electrolytes (K>4 and Mg>2) are repleted.

Please note that the patient's condition is critical, and careful monitoring and management of these medical complications are"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's current condition includes:

1. GI Bleed: The patient is likely experiencing an upper GI bleed, possibly due to esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site. There is also portal hypertensive gastropathy causing oozing in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).
   - Octreotide infusion remains ongoing until September 5th at 1 PM.
   - Protonix has been initiated.
   - Hematocrit (hct) levels will be trended, and hct <25 will be transfused.
   - Cordis access has been established.
   - INR will be monitored, and it should be kept below 2 if active bleeding occurs.
   - Check previous INR and fibrinogen levels.
   - Fibrinogen levels <100 will be treated with cryoprecipitate.
   - The patient will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and receive carafate.
   - Zosyn will be administered empirically for the GI bleed.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list, who was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently intubated for protection of the airway, sedation has been turned off for the past 48 hours without improvement in mental status, and he is not following commands. 

The patient's breathing pattern has been irregular, requiring mandatory minute volume (MMV) overnight after being on assist-control ventilation (ACV) all day. An attempt at pressure support (PS) trial has been made today, and if the patient's mental status clears, consideration will be given to extubation. Speciation and follow-up sputum culture will also be done. 

The patient is receiving Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) given the sputum culture growing gram-negative rods (GNR) on day 5. A CT scan of the head will be performed to evaluate for infarct. 

The patient likely had an upper GI bleed given the history of esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site. This was also contributing to portal hypertensive gastropathy oozing in the setting of elevated international normalized ratio (INR). 

Octreotide infusion will remain on until September 5"

   FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
   vascular territorial infarction. Periventricular white matter
   hypodensities
   suggests chronic microvascular infarction. Ventricles and sulci are
   slightly
   prominent in size, suggestive of mild global parenchymal volume loss.
   The
   included paranasal sinuses reveal a right mucus retention cyst. Also
   noted is
   an air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus as well as at the
   sphenoid
   sinus, suggestive of more acute sinus disease. Circumferential mucosal
   thickening is visualized at the base of the right maxillary sinus.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   2. Sinus disease with suggestion of acute components, predominantly
   involving
   the sphenoid sinus and left maxillary sinus.
PORTABLE CXR [**9-5**]
   Lung volumes are very low suggesting that heterogeneous opacification
   at the
   lung bases is probably due to microatelectasis. Upper lungs are clear
   and
   show no evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. Tip of the
   ET
   tube, with the chin down is acceptable, at least 2.5 cm from the
   carina.
   Right jugular sheath is sharply folded, terminating at the thoracic
   inlet and
   a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Pleural
   effusion
   is small, if any, and there is no pneumothorax.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was transferred from another hospital for evaluation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- The patient is currently being prepared for a liver transplant.
- The patient's current conditions include ESLD, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleed, and possible aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient has a history of GI bleed, and it is likely that the bleed originated from the upper gastrointestinal tract due to esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site.
- The patient also has portal hypertensive gastropathy, which is causing oozing in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).
- The patient has hypernatremia with a 1.4 L deficit and is receiving D5W at 100 cc/hour x 1 L to correct the sodium imbalance.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia with a previous baseline platelet count of 50-60s. He received 1 unit of platelets and is being monitored for any signs of bleeding or if the platelet count falls below 50.
- The patient has an elevated INR likely due to liver disease and coagulopathy. The INR is currently 2.2, and there are"

[**9-5**] CT HEAD
   FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
   vascular territorial infarction. Periventricular white matter
   hypodensities
   suggests chronic microvascular infarction. Ventricles and sulci are
   slightly
   prominent in size, suggestive of mild global parenchymal volume loss.
   The
   included paranasal sinuses reveal a right mucus retention cyst. Also
   noted is
   an air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus as well as at the
   sphenoid
   sinus, suggestive of more acute sinus disease. Circumferential mucosal
   thickening is visualized at the base of the right maxillary sinus.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   2. Sinus disease with suggestion of acute components, predominantly
   involving
   the sphenoid sinus and left maxillary sinus.
PORTABLE CXR [**9-5**]
   Lung volumes are very low suggesting that heterogeneous opacification
   at the
   lung bases is probably due to microatelectasis. Upper lungs are clear
   and
   show no evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. Tip of the
   ET
   tube, with the chin down is acceptable, at least 2.5 cm from the
   carina.
   Right jugular sheath is sharply folded, terminating at the thoracic
   inlet and
   a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Pleural
   effusion
   is small, if any, and there is no pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMHx of alcoholic ESLD on transplant list, esophageal
   varices transferred from [**Hospital1 1195**] for further evaluation of TIPs procedure
   after GI bleed, now being prepared for liver transplant.
   .
   # ESLD: Complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy.
   Diagnosic para negative for SBP. Liver U/S without portal venous flow.
   Now being prepared for liver transplant
   - hold nadolol given GI bleed
   - continue rifaxamin and lactulose
   - appreciate liver input
   - appreciate transplant surgery involvement
   # HCAP: On day [**5-10**] of Zosyn for HCAP.  CXR with LLL collapse and ?
   infiltrate in RML.  Possible aspiration with intubation. OSH culture
   with GBS.
   - f/u sputum culture
 GNRs
 will need speciation
   .
   # GI Bleed: Likely upper given history of esophageal varices and
   gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site. Also contributing with
   portal hypertensive gastropathy oozing in setting of elevated INR. s/p
   octreotide gtt
   - protonix [**Hospital1 **]
   - q24 hour hct, xfuse hct<25
   - Cordis for access
   - trend INR, keep INR <2 with FFP or active bleeding
   - NPO
   - carafate
   - zosyn empiric for GI bleed
   # Hypernatremia: - 1.4 L deficit
   - D5W at 100 cc / hour x 1 L
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Documented at OSH and previous ultrasounds at
   [**Hospital1 1**]. Given recent GIB anticoagulation contraindicated.
   -monitor LFTs
   .
   # Thombocytopenia: Previous baseine 50-60s. Received 1 units of
   platelets.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse if active bleeding or plt < 50
   # Elevated INR: Likely [**1-4**] liver disease and coagulopathy given recent
   bleeds. INR 2.2.  No current signs of bleeding admission or oozing from
   IVs. FDP elevated.
   - f/u fibrinogen replace <100
   - trend INR
   - will defer to transplant surgery regarding FFP and INR goals
   # Prolonged QT: Borderline on previous EKGs here. Noted on admission
   EKG.
   - Avoid meds that could prolong QT more
   - Replete lytes K>4 and Mg>2

   Disposition:Transfer to Transplant Surgery
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and is on the transplant list. He was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure after experiencing a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Now, he is being prepared for a liver transplant.
- The patient has complications related to ESLD, including variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnostic tests have ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and a liver ultrasound showed no portal venous flow.
- The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and is currently on day [5-10] of Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for treatment. A chest X-ray revealed left lower lobe (LLL) collapse and possible aspiration with intubation. Sputum culture results will be needed for further speciation of Gram-negative rods (GNRs).
- The patient likely experienced an upper GI bleed, possibly due to esophageal varices and gastric/esophageal ulcers at the banding site, as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy oozing in the setting of an elevated INR. Treatment includes octreotide, proton pump inhibitor (P"
