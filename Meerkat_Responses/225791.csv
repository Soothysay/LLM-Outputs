   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with hx of EtOH cirrhsosis with acute change in mental
   status found to have 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous
   baseline which was A+O x 3 although it seems unlikely that the bleed is
   the source of altered MS [**First Name (Titles) 1327**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2854**] encephalopathy and renal
   failure as well as developing GI bleed.
   > ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: multiple etiologies with right parietal bleed
   1cm known and : toxic-metabolic (infection new SBP, cellulitis, bleed,
   renal failure), encephalopathy and sub-clinical status are all
   possible.  Less likely but possible would include a
   encephalitis/meningitis. His clinical picture is also complicated now
   by GI bleed.
   - Goal plts>50 INR < 1.5
   - EEG  f/u read today and d/w with neurology.
   -  Place NG tube
   - Cont keppra therapy
   - cont thiamine, folate
   > GI bleed: drop in HCT with dark stools and inappropriate response to
   transfusion with neg lavage (was started on octreotide  empirically)
   with no hemodynamic instability. Will discuss further workup with GI.
   He does have a hx of recent polypectomy whch may be the source of the
   bleeding.
   - Transfuse to keep  Hct > 30, INR < 1.5 and Plts >50
   > Rash: the rash is c/w a a drug rash and pre-dates the dosing of the
   keppra and the Abx. He does have a hx of drug rash rxn to amoxicillin.
   We will stop the pip-tazo today. This could also be a mixed picture of
   drug rash and cellulitis. Another suspect would be Keppra (rash in 2%of
   cases) will stop if EEg neg.
 HYPOXEMIA:  has a baseline hypoxemia likely [**2-8**] functional splinting
   and baseline atelectasis at the lung bases
   - Supportive O2 at present
   - HOB elevation
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH): treatment as above, appreciate
   neurosug input, for now conserve management with INR and platelets
   targets as above.
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC: no evidence of SBP by labs. No varices
   by EGD on [**11-25**].  Increasing total bilirubin this AM unclear if this is
   [**2-8**] GU bleed.
   - check direct bili, check hapto and periph smear.
   - NG tube
   - lactulose and rifax
 RENAL FAILURE: presumably 2/2 HRS now on HD. Possible HD today and
   cont phos binders.
  Infection: no SBP based on paracentesis but the area of abd erythema
   is increasing ? cellulitis, it seems wise to cover broadly with Vanco
   and Pip-tazo (recent abdominal surgery) however his rash increasing
   with pip-tazo and hx of amox and low susp for GNR component of
   cellulitis.
   - Treat cellulitis with Vanc and stop the pip tazo.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who presented with acute changes in mental status, a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy. The patient also has renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a rash. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a known intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which is likely related to his liver cirrhosis. This can cause altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has dark stools and a drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to hypovolemic shock and further deterioration of organ function.

4. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, which can be exacerbated by hypotension due to bleeding or inadequate renal perfusion. It is important to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.

5. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including erythema in the abdominal area, which could indicate cellulitis or a subcutaneous abscess. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be further investigated.

6. Drug rash: The patient's rash may be related to medication, as he has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis. He was found to have an acute change in mental status and a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous baseline. The patient is experiencing altered mental status, renal failure, and a developing gastrointestinal bleed. His clinical picture is complicated by a recent abdominal surgery, infection, and cellulitis. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, intracerebral hemorrhage, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered due to multiple etiologies, including right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic factors (infection, new SBP, cellulitis, bleed, renal failure), encephalopathy, and sub-clinical status.
2. GI bleed: The patient has a developing gastrointestinal bleed, indicated by a drop in hematocrit with dark stools and inappropriate response to transfusion.
3. Renal failure: The patient is presumed to have renal failure, which may be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given his cirrhosis of the liver.
4. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including erythema in the abdominal area, which could indicate cellulitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage is recommended.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient has baseline hypoxemia, likely functional splinting, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with hx of EtOH cirrhsosis with acute change in mental
   status found to have 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous
   baseline which was A+O x 3 although it seems unlikely that the bleed is
   the source of altered MS [**First Name (Titles) 1327**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2854**] encephalopathy and renal
   failure.
   > ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: multiple etiologies with right parietal bleed
   1cm known and : toxic-metabolic (infection new SBP, cellulitis, bleed,
   renal failure), encephalopathy and sub-clinical status are all
   possible.  Less likely but possible would include a
   encephalitis/meningitis. For now it seems reasonable to perform HD,
   place NG tube for lactulose and rifax for encephalopathy. We will check
   a EEG and empirically treat for subclinical seizures with keppra
   pending the results of this workup. We will discuss with the neurology
   team as to whether an LP needs to be performed.
   - Goal plts>50 INR < 1.5
   - EEG
   -  Place NG tube
   - Cont keppra therapy
   - F/u with neurology re: LP
 HYPOXEMIA:  has a baseline hypoxemia likely [**2-8**] functional splinting
   and baseline atelectasis at the lung bases and possibly also hepatopulm
   syndrome component
   - Supportive O2 at present
   - HOB elevation
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH): treatment as above, appreciate
   neurosug input, for now conserve management with INR and platelets.
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC: no evidence of SBP by labs. No varices
   by EGD on [**11-25**].
   - NG tube
   - lactulose and rifax
 RENAL FAILURE: presumably 2/2 HRS now on HD. Will perform HD today
   and cont phos binders.
  Infection: no SBP based on paracentesis but the area of abd erythema
   is increasing ? cellulitis, it seems wise to cover broadly with Vanco
   and Pip-tazo (recent abdominal surgery). Also possible is a meningitis,
   will f/u with neuro re: LP.
   - Check blood clx from PICC and HD cath
   - Treat cellulitis with Vanc and Pip-tazo. Mark the borders

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis who presented with an acute change in mental status. He has a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous baseline but it is unlikely to be the source of his altered mental status. The patient is also experiencing renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has multiple potential etiologies for his altered mental status, including the right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic factors (such as infection), encephalopathy, and sub-clinical status. These conditions need to be addressed and managed appropriately.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient has baseline hypoxemia, which may be functional due to splinting and atelectasis at the lung bases. Supportive oxygen therapy and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) can help improve oxygenation.

3. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has an ICH, which requires conservative management with targeted INR and platelet levels. Neurosurgical input may be required.

4. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, but there is no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or varices at this time. Lactulose and rifaximin can be used to manage encephalopathy.

5. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, likely secondary to hep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who has undergone a liver laceration repair and is now experiencing hepatorenal syndrome. He was transferred to the MICU after his mental status worsened, revealing a parietal bleed and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient's current conditions include neuro/altered mental status with a parietal bleed, infection, and hepatic encephalopathy. The etiology of the bleed is currently unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and non-convulsive status epilepticus indicate a potential risk for further neurological complications such as seizures or encephalopathy.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient continues to have maroon stool, indicating ongoing bleeding. There may be a need for an endoscopy (EGD) or colonoscopy to identify the source of bleeding and determine appropriate treatment.
3. Infection: Despite negative data, there is concern for an abdominal cellulitis or a systemic infection. Antibiotics have been started for concern of SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) during bleeding.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of hypoxemia with ambulation during hospitalization. Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent repair of a liver laceration. He is now experiencing hepatorenal syndrome and has been transferred to the MICU due to worsened mental status. The workup revealed a parietal bleed and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with etiology of bleed currently unknown. Neuro and neurosurg are following for the bleed, and there is no indication for OR. The patient's platelet count needs to be kept above 50K, INR below 1.5, and a repeat CT head should be assessed for progression of bleed. IV keppra 500mg is to be administered now, along with stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI. An LP with opening pressure should be done as per neuro recs, and an EEG should be performed. The patient's NGT should be replaced, and lactulose and rifaxamin should be started.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Parietal bleed: The patient has a non-convulsive status epilepticus and a parietal bleed. The etiology of the bleed is currently unknown, and neuro and neurosurg are following for the bleed. There is no indication for OR, and efforts are being made to reverse platelet and coagulopathy issues. Repeat CT head should be assessed for progression of bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with signs of liver failure, including cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has renal failure, acute kidney injury, and anemia secondary to blood loss. There are concerns about impaired airway protection, hypoxemia, intracranial hemorrhage, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving various treatments, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and supportive care measures. The patient's condition remains critical, and they are currently on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of maroon stools suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to further blood loss, hypotension, and shock.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. If left untreated, this can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the need for dialysis.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure and the presence of a central line make them susceptible to infections. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infection.
4. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's altered mental status and low platelet count raise concerns for intracranial hemorrhage. This condition can worsen neurological outcomes and have a significant"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown changes in mental status, which can be caused by various factors such as toxic-metabolic (infection, renal failure, etc.), encephalopathy, sub-clinical status, or even less likely encephalitis/meningitis. Close monitoring and further investigations are necessary to determine the underlying cause.

2. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous baseline. This could potentially worsen or lead to additional complications if not managed properly. Appropriate measures should be taken to control the bleeding and maintain the patient's INR and platelet levels within target ranges.

3. GI Bleed: The patient has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, indicated by a drop in hemoglobin concentration and dark stools. This could be due to recent polypectomy, among other possible causes. Close observation and treatment are required to stabilize the patient and address the source of bleeding.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient has baseline hypoxemia, likely functional splinting, and atelectasis at the lung bases. Supportive oxygen therapy and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) can help manage this condition.

5. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis. Regular monitoring of liver function and management of complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis presenting with acute changes in mental status, a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple potential etiologies for the altered mental status, including toxic-metabolic factors such as infection (newspaper and cellulitis), bleed, renal failure, encephalopathy, and subclinical status. Less likely but possible causes include encephalitis/meningitis. The patient's clinical picture is also complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed, which is likely related to a recent polypectomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has acute changes in mental status, which can be attributed to several factors, including toxic-metabolic factors like infection, bleed, renal failure, encephalopathy, and subclinical status. Less likely but possible causes include encephalitis/meningitis. Monitoring the patient closely for any further deterioration in mental status is crucial.

2. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has a known 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. Treatment should focus on maintaining the target INR and platelet levels as mentioned above, and input from neurosurgery should be appreciated for now.

3. GI Bleeding: The patient has developed gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to a recent polype"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis. He presented with acute changes in mental status and was found to have a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including altered mental status, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a rash. He is also being treated for hypoxygenemia and intracerebral hemorrhage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which can have multiple etiologies. These include the right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic factors such as infection (newspaper, cellulitis), renal failure, and encephalopathy. Other possible causes like encephalitis/meningitis should also be considered. The patient's clinical picture is complicated by a recent gastrointestinal bleed.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is presumed to have renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). He is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and may require further sessions.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, evidenced by a drop in hematocrit (HCT) levels and dark stools. This could be due to the recent polypectomy, which may be the source of bleeding. The patient is hemodynamically stable, and the stool output is less maroon. Transfusion is being given to maintain HCT > 30, IN"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with hx of EtOH cirrhsosis with acute change in mental
   status found to have 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous
   baseline which was A+O x 3 although it seems unlikely that the bleed is
   the source of altered MS [**First Name (Titles) 1327**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2854**] encephalopathy and renal
   failure as well as developing GI bleed.
   > ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: multiple etiologies with right parietal bleed
   1cm known and : toxic-metabolic (infection new SBP, cellulitis, bleed,
   renal failure), encephalopathy and sub-clinical status are all
   possible.  Less likely but possible would include a
   encephalitis/meningitis. His clinical picture is also complicated now
   by GI bleed.  He has continued to improve, will f/u read of the EEG and
   if negative EEG will stop keppra.
   - Goal plts>50 INR < 1.5
   - EEG  f/u read today and d/w with neurology.
   -  Re-Place NG tube
   - Cont keppra therapy
   - cont thiamine, folate
   > GI bleed: drop in HCT with dark stools and inappropriate response to
   transfusion with neg lavage (was started on octreotide  empirically)
   with no hemodynamic instability. Will discuss further workup with GI.
   He does have a hx of recent polypectomy whch may be the source of the
   bleeding, he remains hemo stable and the stool out put is less maroon
   - Transfuse to keep  Hct > 30, INR < 1.5 and Plts >50
   - Will d/w with liver service stopping the octreotide
   > Rash: the rash is c/w a a drug rash and pre-dates the dosing of the
   keppra and the Abx. He does have a hx of drug rash rxn to amoxicillin.
   We will stop the pip-tazo today. This could also be a mixed picture of
   drug rash and cellulitis. Another suspect would be Keppra (rash in 2%of
   cases) will stop if EEg neg.
 HYPOXEMIA:  has a baseline hypoxemia likely [**2-8**] functional splinting
   and baseline atelectasis at the lung bases
   - Supportive O2 at present
   - HOB elevation
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH): treatment as above, appreciate
   neurosug input, for now conserve management with INR and platelets
   targets as above.
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC: no evidence of SBP by labs. No varices
   by EGD on [**11-25**].  Increasing total bilirubin this AM unclear if this is
   [**2-8**] GU bleed.
   - check direct bili, check hapto and periph smear.
   - NG tube
   - lactulose and rifax
   - discuss with liver re: therapeutic paracentesis
 RENAL FAILURE: presumably 2/2 HRS now on HD. Possible HD today and
   cont phos binders.
  Infection: no SBP based on paracentesis but the area of abd erythema
   is increasing ? cellulitis, covering with only Vanco for cellulitis.
   No indication for SBP
   - Treat cellulitis with Vanc  for 7 day course

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute changes in mental status, intracerebral hemorrhage, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infection. He has been diagnosed with altered mental status, hypoxemia, intracerebral hemorrhage, cirrhosis of the liver, renal failure, infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased risk of infections due to cirrhosis and immunosuppression.
2. Development of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Progression of renal failure.
4. Re-bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Development of complications related to intracerebral hemorrhage such as increased intracranial pressure or secondary brain injury.
6. Potential need for surgical intervention for the intracerebral hemorrhage.
7. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's coagulation status.
8. Possibility of sepsis secondary to infection.
9. Monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances.
10. Potential complications associated with dialysis, if required.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive evaluation."

   - no scope at this time since he seems to have stabilized and etiology
   likely post-polypectomy
   - d/c octreotide since no esophageal varices
   - goal plts >75k, INR<1.5
   3.       Hypoxemia; etiology somewhat unclear, though abdominal
   distension/low lung volumes likely contributing; small pulm AV shunting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) due to hepatorenal syndrome, recent hemoperitoneum from a traumatic liver biopsy requiring exploratory laparotomy, admitted with delirium and gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss. The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial, potentially caused by hepatic encephalopathy, infection (abdominal cellulitis), small parietal bleed, and possibly nonconvulsive status epilepticus. 

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status is improving, but the exact cause of the delirium remains unclear. It is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and levetiracetam for nonconvulsive status epilepticus. An MRI/MRA of the brain is planned to evaluate the parietal hemorrhage, but it is not urgent as the patient's mental status is improving.

2. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced a GI bleed, likely post-polypectomy, resulting in acute blood loss anemia. He is hemodynamically stable, and no packed red blood cells (pRBCs) have been needed in the past 24 hours. The goal is to maintain a platelet count above 75k and an INR below 1.5.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, CKD on HD from hepatorenal
   syndrome, recent hemoperitoneum from traumatic liver biopsy requiring
   ex-lap, admitted with delirium and GI blood loss.
   1.       Delirium; likely multifactorial from hepatic encephalopathy,
   infection (abdominal cellulitis), small parietal bleed; no evidence of
   epileptiform activity
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin to treat hepatic encephalopathy
   - levetiracetam discontinued yesterday
   - MRI/MRA of brain when stable to evaluate parietal hemorrhage; no
   urgent need to perform since mental status is improving and it will not
   change acute mgmt
   2.       Alcoholic cirrhosis; encephalopathy rx as above; listed for
   transplant
   3.       Acute blood loss anemia from GI bleed; hemodynamically stable;
   no pRBCs needed in past 24 hrs; likely post-polypectomy bleed
   - cont to monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - no scope at this time since he seems to have stabilized and etiology
   likely post-polypectomy
   - goal plts >75k, INR<1.5
   4.       Hypoxemia; etiology somewhat unclear, though abdominal
   distension/low lung volumes likely contributing; small pulm AV shunting
   also seen on TTE
   - defer therapeutic paracentesis given agitation
   5.       Abdominal cellulitis
   - improving with vancomycin; cont for 7 day course; increased Vanco
   dose to 1250 mg due to low trough level
   6.       Rash; improved since stopping pip/tazo supporting the notion
   of drug rash
   - cont to monitor
   7.       CKD V secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   - renal input appreciated; may also need renal transplant

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) due to hepatorenal syndrome, recent hemoperitoneum from a traumatic liver biopsy requiring exploratory laparotomy, admitted with delirium and gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss.
- The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial, caused by hepatic encephalopathy, infection (abdominal cellulitis), and a small parietal bleed. Treatment includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and discontinuing levetiracetam since there is no evidence of epileptiform activity.
- The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis and is listed for a liver transplant. His acute blood loss anemia from the GI bleed has stabilized, and he is not in need of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in the past 24 hours. The etiology of the GI bleed is likely post-polypectomy. Monitoring of hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and platelet count is recommended, aiming for platelet levels above 75,000 and INR below 1.5.
- The patient has hypoxemia, with an unclear etiology, although abdominal distension/low lung volumes may contribute. Small pulmonary arteriovenous shunting is also seen on trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE"

   no pRBCs needed in past 24 hrs; likely post-polypectomy bleed
   - cont to monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - no scope at this time since he seems to have stabilized and etiology
   likely post-polypectomy
   - goal plts >75k, INR<1.5
   4.       Hypoxemia; etiology somewhat unclear, though abdominal
   distension/low lung volumes likely contributing; small pulm AV shunting
   also seen on TTE
   - defer therapeutic paracentesis given agitation
   5.       Abdominal cellulitis
   - improving with vancomycin; cont for 7 day course; increased Vanco
   dose to 1250 mg due to low trough level
   6.       Rash; improved since stopping pip/tazo supporting the notion
   of drug rash
   - cont to monitor
   7.       CKD V secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   -          renal input appreciated; may also need renal transplant

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis due to hepatorenal syndrome, recent hemoperitoneum from a traumatic liver biopsy requiring exploratory laparotomy, and admitted with delirium and gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss. The patient has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and levetiracetam has been discontinued. An MRI/MRA of the brain is planned to evaluate a parietal hemorrhage, but it will not change acute management as the patient's mental status is improving. The patient is listed for a liver transplant and is being monitored for acute blood loss anemia from a likely post-polypectomy bleed. The patient's goal is to have platelets >75k and an international normalized ratio (INR) <1.5. Hypoxemia is present, possibly due to abdominal distension/low lung volumes and small pulmonary arteriovenous shunting seen on trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE). Therapeutic paracentesis is deferred due to agitation. The patient has abdominal cellulitis, which is improving with vancomycin, and the dose has been increased due to low trough levels. A rash has improved since stopping piperacillin-tazobactam, suggesting drug rash. The patient has CKD V secondary to hepatorenal syndrome and may require"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis, presenting with acute changes in mental status, intracerebral hemorrhage, renal failure, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's clinical picture was complicated by a GI bleed, which is now inactive, and a known 1 cm right parietal bleed. The patient's altered mental status has multiple possible etiologies including the right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic, infection, and encephalopathy. The patient's condition has improved, and he is now listed as active on the transplant list for liver and likely kidney.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status can be attributed to various factors such as the right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic causes, infection, and encephalopathy. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in consciousness or cognitive function.
2. Intracerebral hemorrhage: The patient has a known 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. There is a risk of further bleeding or expansion of the hemorrhage, which can worsen neurological outcomes. Close monitoring and neurologic assessment are necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). This condition requires ongoing management with hemodialysis (HD) to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis presenting with acute changes in mental status, intracerebral hemorrhage, renal failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and possible drug rash. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical complications, including altered mental status, GI bleeding, renal failure, and a drug rash. The patient has been listed as active on the liver transplant list and is likely to also be listed for a kidney transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to several factors such as right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic disturbances, infection, or encephalopathy. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the underlying cause.
2. Intracerebral hemorrhage: The patient has a known 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. It is important to monitor for any worsening of the hemorrhage or development of new neurological symptoms.
3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, which may be related to hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HRS). He is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD) with minimal urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and continued HD may be necessary.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has had a GI bleed, which has now resolved. However, there is a concern for re-bleeding, especially considering his history of recent polypectomy. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and ongoing GI evaluation are essential.
5. Drug rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, which is believed to be drug-induced. Discontinuation of the offending medication and supportive care are recommended. The rash is improving with continued vancomycin treatment.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient has baseline hypoxemia, likely due to functional splinting and atelectasis at the lung bases caused by ascites. Supportive oxygen therapy and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) are being provided.
7. ETOH cirrhosis: The patient has a history of ETOH cirrhosis. Regular monitoring of liver function and ongoing evaluation for complications such as hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatic encephalopathy are necessary.
8. Cellulitis: The patient may have cellulitis in the abdominal area, but it is improving with vancomycin treatment alone. Ongoing assessment for signs of infection or worsening cellulitis is required.
9. Kidney transplant: Considering the patient's renal failure, he will likely also be listed for kidney transplantation. This will require further evaluation and management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these potential complications accordingly."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis. He presented with an acute change in mental status, which was found to be due to multiple etiologies including a right parietal hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic factors, infection, and encephalopathy. The patient also developed gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding but is currently inactive. He has been listed as active on the transplant list for both liver and kidney.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can be attributed to several factors such as the right parietal hemorrhage, toxic-metabolic factors, infection, and encephalopathy. It is crucial to monitor his mental status closely and manage any underlying causes.

2. Right Parietal Hemorrhage: The patient has a known 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. Although it seems unlikely that this bleed is the source of his altered mental status, it should still be monitored for any signs of expansion or worsening.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient has encephalopathy, likely related to his liver failure. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin to reduce ammonia levels and manage hepatic encephalopathy.

4. GI Bleeding: The patient experienced GI bleeding, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. The bleeding has since become inactive, but close monitoring is required to detect"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who presented with acute changes in mental status. He was found to have a 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous baseline. The patient's clinical picture was complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, which is now inactive. He also has renal failure and encephalopathy. The patient's altered mental status could be due to multiple etiologies, including the right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic factors, infection, and encephalopathy. The patient is improving and is currently listed for liver and kidney transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has multiple possible causes for his altered mental status, including the right parietal bleed, toxic-metabolic factors, infection, and encephalopathy. Monitoring and treating these potential causes will be important in managing the patient's mental status.

2. Right parietal hemorrhage: The patient has a known 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. It is important to monitor the size and progression of the hemorrhage, and neurologic evaluation should continue.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient experienced an inactive gastrointestinal bleed. Close monitoring for any signs of recurrent bleeding or complications related to the previous bleed is necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, which may be related to hepatorenal syndrome. Dialysis is already initiated and should be continued as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU with acute changes in mental status, intracranial hemorrhage, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypoxemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease. This condition can be exacerbated by infections, bleeding, or renal failure.

2. Renal failure: The patient has signs of renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration of organ function.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, likely secondary to portal hypertension and esophageal varices. This can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, and shock if not managed promptly.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient has a baseline hypoxemia, which may be due to functional splinting of the lungs and atelectasis. Oxygen supplementation and position changes may be necessary to improve oxygenation.

5. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a known 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage. This increases the risk of further bleeding and neurological deterioration. Close monitoring and aggressive"

   62 yo male with hx of EtOH cirrhosis with acute change in mental status
   found to have 1 cm right parietal hemorrhage from a previous baseline
   which was A+O x 3 although it seems unlikely that the bleed is the
   source of altered MS [**First Name (Titles) 1327**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2854**] encephalopathy and renal failure as
   well as developing GI bleed.
   > ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: multiple etiologies with right parietal bleed
   1cm known and : toxic-metabolic (infection new SBP, cellulitis, bleed,
   renal failure), encephalopathy and sub-clinical status are all
   possible.  Less likely but possible would include a
   encephalitis/meningitis. His clinical picture is also complicated now
   by GI bleed.  He has continued to improve, will f/u read of the EEG and
   if negative EEG will stop keppra.
   - Goal plts>50 INR < 1.5
   - EEG  f/u read today and d/w with neurology.

   > GI bleed: drop in HCT with dark stools and inappropriate response to
   transfusion with neg lavage (was started on octreotide  empirically)
   with no hemodynamic instability. Will discuss further workup with GI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with acute changes in mental status, an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), renal failure, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has also shown signs of hypoxemia, infection, and cellulitis. His condition has been complicated by multiple factors, including potential encephalopathy, sub-clinical status, and a possible encephalitis/meningitis. The patient's current treatment plan includes maintaining a platelet count above 50,000/mm3, an INR below 1.5, and a hematocrit level above 30. He is also receiving supportive care for hypoxemia, including oxygen therapy and head of bed elevation. The patient's medications include pantoprazole, keppra, thiamine, folate, octreotide, and vancomycin. Further evaluations and consultations are planned with the neurology and liver services.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has a known 1cm right parietal hemorrhage. It is important to closely monitor his neurological status and continue with the current management plan, including maintaining appropriate INR and platelet levels.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status may be due to various causes such as toxic-metabolic factors, infection, encephalopathy, sub-clinical status"
