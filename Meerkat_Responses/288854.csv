","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a pacemaker/defibrillator. He presented with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient has a likely fractured right ventricular lead resulting in episodes of syncope. Temporary pacing wire placement in the right internal jugular vein was performed, and he is awaiting lead revision. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with an unknown history of tachy-brady versus complete heart block, and he has had a dual-chamber pacemaker upgrade to dual-chamber biventricular pacing. He experienced symptomatic asystole/pauses likely due to a fractured RV lead and has an external pacer in place. The plan is for lead revision on Monday. 

The patient is on bedrest with commode privileges and has been given Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma due to therapeutic INR of 2.8. His neurological status is intact without concerning neuro checks, and his subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage is stable. Repeat CT scan showed little change with only slight mass effect on adjacent sulci and no shift of normally midline structures. 

The patient has moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation"

He presented with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage on NCHCT. The patient had a likely fractured right ventricular (RV) lead resulting in episodes of syncope, and temporary pacing wire placement in the right internal jugular vein (IJ) was performed by the electrophysiology (EP) lab. He is awaiting RV lead revision.

The patient's current medical condition includes rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation with unknown tachy-brady versus complete heart block), previous dual-chamber pacemaker implantation in [**2143**] with an upgrade to dual-chamber biventricular (BiV) pacing in [**2149**]. The patient experienced symptomatic asystole/pauses likely due to the fractured RV lead and has an external pacer in place. The plan is to revise the RV lead on Monday.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 70-72 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 119/59 mmHg to 127/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (inspiratory), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. He presented with presyncope, syncope, and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage on non-contrast head CT. The patient had a likely fractured right ventricular lead resulting in episodes of syncope, and he underwent temporary pacing wire placement in the right internal jugular vein. He is currently awaiting lead revision on Monday. The patient's current medications include aspirin, amiodarone, torsemide, spironolactone, metoprolol, and multivitamins. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy increases the risk of arrhythmias and heart failure. The fractured RV lead may also contribute to further cardiac complications.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has a subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
3. Infection: The patient is on vancomycin, indicating a possible infection or risk of infection. Infections can be life-threatening, especially in the ICU setting.
4. Renal complications: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and his creatinine levels should be monitored daily. Avoiding nephrotoxins and adjusting medications according"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a previous pacemaker implantation. He presents with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan. The patient had a fractured RV lead resulting in episodes of syncope, and he underwent temporary pacing wire placement in the right internal jugular vein.

The patient's current medical conditions include rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation), possible fractured RV lead causing symptomatic asystole/pauses, and post-traumatic subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is awaiting lead revision surgery today.

The patient is on several medications including amiodarone, aspirin, metoprolol, torsemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, acetaminophen, allopurinol, potassium chloride, senna, simethicone, bisacodyl, colchicine, docusate sodium, multivitamins with minerals, and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and previous pacemaker implantation increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and potential complications related to the fractured RV lead.

2. Neurological complications: The presence of subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrh"

","The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a past medical history of tachy-brady syndrome versus complete heart block, who presented with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage. He underwent a temporary pacemaker placement and was later found to have a fractured right ventricular lead causing episodes of syncope. The patient then underwent a new pacemaker placement in the operating room.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation with a history of tachy-brady syndrome versus complete heart block), pump dysfunction (ejection fraction of 30-35%), coronary artery disease (non-ischemic cardiomyopathy), chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.3), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 132/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no known drug allergies.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including the extraction and replacement of his pacemaker lead, placement of a new pacemaker, and insertion of arterial and venous lines. He is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a previous dual-chamber pacemaker placement with an upgrade to dual-chamber biventricular pacing in [**2143**] and [**2149**]. He presents with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural/hemorrhage (SDH)/subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on non-contrast head CT. The patient had a likely fractured right ventricular (RV) lead resulting in episodes of syncope, and temporary pacing wire placement in the right internal jugular vein was performed by the electrophysiologist (EP) team. The patient is awaiting lead revision. His current medications include warfarin, amiodarone, and beta-blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may experience symptomatic asystole/pauses due to the likely fractured RV lead.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin) due to the risk of infection related to the temporary pacing wire placement.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a subdural/hemorrhage (SDH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. The INR needs to be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of cardiomyopathy and a history of syncope. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient underwent an extraction and replacement of his pacemaker lead, as well as placement of a new pacemaker. He is currently on multiple medications including omeprazole, furosemide, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing some fluid balance issues with a negative balance of 2.5 liters. His lab results show elevated troponin T levels, but otherwise, they are within normal range. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. He is also receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's underlying condition can lead to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac arrest.
2. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The presence of this problem increases the risk of neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or cognitive impairment.
3. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): Similar to SDH, SAH can result in neurological complications including increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or cognitive impairment.
4. Negative Fluid Balance: The patient's negative fluid balance indicates significant fluid loss, which can lead to dehydration, electroly"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a previous pacemaker implantation. He presented with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural/hematoma on neuroimaging. The fractured RV lead was likely causing episodes of syncope, and temporary pacing wire placement in the right IJ was performed.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with a history of tachy-brady versus complete heart block, previously implanted dual-chamber pacemaker (in 2143) with an upgrade to dual-chamber BiV (in 2149), symptomatic asystole/pauses likely due to fractured RV lead. An external pacer is in place, and lead revision is planned.

2. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH)/Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): Post-traumatic in the setting of syncope/fall while on therapeutic coumadin with INR 2.8. The patient received Vitamin K 7mg PO and 4units FFP. Neurologically intact without concerning neuro checks, SDH/SAH stable per NSG. Repeat CT showed little change with only slight mass effect on adjacent sulci and no shift of normally midline structures.

3. Pump Function: Ejection fraction (EF) 30-35%."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a past medical history of tachy-brady syndrome versus complete heart block, status post dual chamber pacemaker placement in [2143] with an upgrade to dual chamber BiV in [2149]. He presents with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural/hematoma on non-contrast head CT. The patient has a fractured RV lead resulting in episodes of syncope and underwent a new pacemaker placement in the operating room on [2153-6-18].

The patient was desaturated to 88% yesterday when weaning was attempted. He received an additional dose of lasix 40 mg IV X1. Fluid overload is likely, so it is planned to reattempt weaning today, and home oxygen may be considered if further difficulties arise.

The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a history of tachy-brady syndrome versus complete heart block, status post dual chamber pacemaker placement in [2143] with an upgrade to dual chamber BiV in [2149]. He had symptomatic asystole/pauses likely due to a fractured RV lead. An external pacer was used, and the lead revision was done yesterday without complications. Telemetry monitoring will continue, and the patient will be continued on beta-blockers and amiodarone"

The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. He presents with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural/hematoma on NCHCT. He underwent a dual chamber pacemaker placement in the OR on [**2153-6-18**] due to a fractured RV lead resulting in episodes of syncope. He is currently in the ICU with the following concerns:

1. Oxygen requirement: The patient is on 2L NC, saturating around 93%. He desaturated to 88% yesterday when weaning was attempted. Diuresis with Lasix 40 mg IV X2 was given. A reattempt to wean today is planned. An increase in home dose of torsemide to 80 mg daily for 2 days post-discharge is recommended. Home O2 may be considered if further difficulties occur.

2. Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a history of tachy-brady versus complete heart block. He has a dual chamber pacemaker placed in [**2143**] and later upgraded to dual chamber BiV in [**2149**]. He is symptomatic with asystole/pauses likely due to a fractured RV lead.

   Assessment and Plan
   83-yo man with HTN, Afib on coumadin, non-ischemic CMP, ?h/o
   tachy-brady versus complete heart block, s/p dual chamber pacemaker in
   [**2143**] with upgrade to dual chamber BiV [**2149**], who presents with
   presyncope/syncope, falls, and SDH/SAH on NCHCT, found to have a likely
   fractured RV lead resulting in episodes of syncope, now s/p new PPM
   placement in OR [**2153-6-18**].
   .
   #. RHYTHM: Pt with Afib, ?h/o tachy-brady versus complete heart block,
   s/p dual chamber pacemaker [**2143**] w/ upgrade to dual chamber BiV [**2149**],
   p/w symptomatic asystole / pauses likely [**1-29**] fractured RV lead. Had
   external pacer, underwent lead revision yesterday w/ no complications
   - monitor on telemetry
   - cont BB
   - cont Amio
   - no anticoagulation given SDH/SAH as below. Coumadin to be restarted
   either 1 week from discharge vs. after outpt head CT
   - EP recs: continue abx for 1 week post-procedure
   .
   #. SDH/SAH: Post-traumatic in setting of syncope/fall while therapeutic
   on coumadin with INR 2.8, s/p Vitamin K 7mg PO and 4units
   FFP.Neurologically intact without concerning neuro checks, SDH/SAH
   stable per NSG. Repeat CT showed little change with only slight mass
   effect on adjacent sulci and no shift of normally midline structures
   - repeat CT-head [**6-21**], f/u w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6858**] in 1month (pt asked to call
   directly for appt)
   - cont Q4hr neuro checks while in CCU
   - INR 1.5 or less
   - maintain active T&C

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a past medical history of tachy-brady versus complete heart block, who underwent dual chamber pacemaker placement in [2143] with an upgrade to dual chamber BiV [2149]. The patient presented with presyncope/syncope, falls, and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage on NCHCT, which were found to be likely due to a fractured RV lead resulting in episodes of syncope. The patient subsequently underwent new pacemaker placement in the OR [2153-6-18].

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with an unknown history of tachy-brady versus complete heart block, and had a dual chamber pacemaker placed in [2143] with an upgrade to dual chamber BiV [2149]. The patient is symptomatic asystole/pauses likely due to a fractured RV lead. An external pacer was used, followed by lead revision yesterday without complications. The patient is currently on telemetry, continuous beta-blockers (BB), and amiodarone (Amio), with plans to restart coumadin either one week from discharge or after an outpatient head CT.

2. SDH/SAH: The patient has post-traumatic"
