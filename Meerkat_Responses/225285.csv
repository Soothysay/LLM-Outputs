","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5263] is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of colon cancer complicated by bilateral ureteral obstruction requiring percutaneous nephroureteral stent and colostomy. She presents with weakness, likely secondary to ongoing bleeding from her left nephroureteral tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's HCT nadired at 12.8, indicating acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This can lead to symptoms such as weakness and fatigue.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, with a range of 69-148 mmHg. This may indicate ongoing bleeding leading to hypovolemia and subsequent hypotension.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency at baseline, which can be exacerbated by ongoing bleeding and decreased renal perfusion.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to indwelling lines and catheters. Close monitoring of vital signs and lab parameters is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
5. Thrombosis: Although the patient is on pneumoboots for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, there is still a risk for thrombotic events, especially in the setting of acute illness and immobilization.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has imbalances in various electrolytes, including calcium, magnesium"

 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5263**] is a very pleasant 74 year old female with past medical
   history of colon cancer complicated by bilateral ureteral obstruction
   requiring percutaneous nephroureteral stent and colostomy, who presents
   with weakness, likely secondary to ongoing bleeding from  her left
   nephroureteral tube.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's HCT of 12.8 is a dramatic drop from her discharge
   value of 28.1 on [**2123-4-1**]. She describes several days of ongoing
   bleeding, with clots the size of her fist. She denies any other sources
   of bleeding. In setting of this history, ongoing bleeding from her left
   stent site is most likely. CT scan was without evidence of a
   retroperitoneal or other pathology, although will need to follow up
   final read. Both angiography and tagged RBC scan failed to reveal any
   source of bleeding. She has no known bleeding or coagulation disorders.
   IR has upsized her stent in hopes that this will help with bleeding.
   Given her anatomy, some degree of rectal bleeding may be present, but
   this has not been significant.  Radiation cystitis is also a
   possibility; given lack of significant rectal bleeding, radiation
   proctitis appears less likely.
   - Trend HCT q6H, transfuse for HCT <30 per urology, or acute drop;
   consider transfusion of platelets and FFP/cryo should she need
   additional transfusions given those factors are likely becoming
   depleted
   - Follow calcium and replete aggressively given number of PRBCs (no
   albumin available, but corrected for last albumin of 3.3 is 7.3)
   - Follow up final reads of imaging studies
   - Appreciate urology co-management
   - Continuing continous bladder irrigation per urology
   - Consider general surgery and/or GI consult should she have
   significant rectal bleeding
   - Monitor I/O
s closely (from stents, bladder, and rectal output)
   - Patient with 3 PIV
s in place.
   #) Hypertension: Holding home anti-hypertensives in setting of on-going
   bleeding. Currently normotensive.
   #) Renal insufficiency: Recent baseline creatinine appears to be
   1.7-2.0. Suspect bump on admission to 2.7 was likely pre-renal in
   setting of ongoing losses and continuing home BP medications.
    - Continue to monitor trend, improved today to 2.1 from 2.7.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of colon cancer and bilateral ureteral obstruction requiring percutaneous nephroureteral stent and colostomy. She presents with weakness and ongoing bleeding from her left nephroureteral tube.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 95/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her weight is 95 kg, and height is 63 inches. The patient has received a total of 1,708 mL of fluids since midnight, including 730 mL of intravenous fluids and 360 mL of blood products. She has also had 2,755 mL of urine output.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well, with no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. Her neck veins are supple and flat, lungs are clear, and abdomen is soft with a healthy appearing stoma. There is no apparent bleeding at the stent site or elsewhere. The patient has trace edema bilaterally, but no clubbing or cyanosis. Neurological examination shows that she is alert, oriented, and appropriate.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL (compared to her discharge value of 28.1 on"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of renal papilla fibrosis, which has resulted in bilateral ureteral obstruction and the placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes. She presented with bleeding after a routine tube change and was found to have a hematocrit (Hct) of 12. A computed tomography (CT) scan did not show any signs of renal pelvis bleed. Angiogram and tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan were also negative. Her left-sided stent was upsized to tamponade the bleeding. She has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 120/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is alert and oriented, with no signs of pain or distress.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 16.7%. Other lab values include elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Coagulation studies show a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of renal pelvic fibrosis leading to bilateral ureteral obstruction. She has nephrostomy tubes and experienced bleeding after a routine tube change. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level was found to be 12, and subsequent imaging studies such as a CT scan, angiogram, and tagged red blood cell scan did not show any signs of renal pelvic bleed. Her left-sided stent was upsized to tamponade the bleeding, and she has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/79 mmHg, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She is currently receiving IV fluids and has received a transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs with a follow-up Hct of 28%. 

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for anemia. Her physical examination reveals soft and well-dressed nephrostomy tubes, clear breath sounds, and no abnormalities in her extremities or neurologic assessment.

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, slightly low potassium, and low albumin. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5263**] is a 74-year-old female with a history of colon cancer and bilateral ureteral obstruction requiring a percutaneous nephroureteral stent and colostomy. She presents with weakness likely due to ongoing bleeding from her left nephroureteral tube. Her arterial line was stopped with stable hematocrit (Hct) at 29.4%. A hyperdense collection in the left renal pelvis was observed on CT scan, along with cholelithiasis but no perinephric hematoma. The nephrostomy tube on the left side has an increased rate. She has no known drug allergies and no recent doses of antibiotics.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/97 to 151/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is in sinus rhythm with a weight of 95 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,385 mL, with outputs including 540 mL of PO, 470 mL of TF, 375 mL of blood products, and 3,850 mL of urine. The respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining an SpO2 of 97"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of blood loss anemia. He has been admitted to the ICU and has received 10 units of packed red blood cells due to an unclear source of bleeding, possibly from a genitourinary origin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/61 mmHg to 151/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative total input-output of 2,495 mL, indicating fluid loss. His laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 16.7%, leukocyte count of 9.6 K/uL, platelet count of 195 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of various lines and tubes, including an arterial line, nephrostomy tubes, and urinary catheter. Proper infection control measures should be maintained to prevent infections.
2. Bleeding: Although the source of bleeding is currently unclear, there is a possibility of further bleeding episodes"
