","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. They have a history of tachycardia and are currently experiencing cholecystitis, which is not related to gallstones. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain relievers, and cardiac medications. Their vital signs are stable, but they have low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. They are receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and have a high oxygen saturation level. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and elevated cardiac markers. They have ongoing fluid balance issues, with a positive fluid balance since admission. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their neurologic examination is incomplete. The patient's code status and disposition are not specified.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. The pending urine culture and blood culture indicate an ongoing assessment for infection.
2. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) may suggest liver damage or dysfunction.
3. Cardiac issues: The elevated cardiac markers (TropT, CK, CKMB) indicate potential cardiac injury or disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The abnormal electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate) may require correction to maintain proper bodily functions.
5. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance suggests fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely secondary to dehydration in setting of anorexia and
   nausea, together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline
   impaired cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on
   CXR, chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Consider AICD; cards consult today
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - If persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, will
   discontinue amiodarone and return to lopressor
   - Restart Coumadin for A-fib
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Continue albuterol,
   cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;  hold benadryl
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, NPO for now (regular heart
   healthy diet when taking POs). Folate. PPI.
   # Prophylaxis: SCH, pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR DNI but consider less aggressive interventions such as
   cardiovert/defib if short-term return to baseline status (see OMR note

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She presents with dyspnea and chest pain (CP), found to be hypotensive. The patient was cardioverted for atrial flutter, developed ventricular tachycardia (VTach), defibrillated, and returned to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). A CT abdomen/pelvis showed mild thickening along the transverse colon with associated stranding in the region of the hepatic flexure, which may represent colitis. The patient is admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and low urine output indicate possible shock. The differential diagnosis includes dehydration, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock due to baseline impaired cardiac function.

2. NSTEMI: Elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior T-wave inversion (TWI) on EKG suggest non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Management includes cycle enzymes, managing coronary artery disease, continuing atorvastatin, ASA, and considering anticoagulation if there is a continued enzyme rise.

3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient had possible atr"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presents with dyspnea and chest pain, found to be hypotensive. She was cardioverted for atrial flutter and developed ventricular tachycardia, which was defibrillated and returned to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). She has mild pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray and evidence of colitis on computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis. The patient is admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and shock, likely secondary to dehydration in the setting of anorexia and nausea, along with recent rapid ventricular rates and baseline impaired cardiac function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior T-wave inversion on EKG indicate myocardial injury. Management includes cycle enzymes, managing CAD, continuing atorvastatin, ASA, and discontinuing atorvastatin if liver function tests (LFTs) continue to be abnormal.
2. Tachy-arrhythmia: Possible atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) initially, developed ventricular tachycardia (VTach), and returned to NSR with defibrillation. Management includes continuing amiodarone, considering an implantable cardioverter-def"

   Patient developed CP associated with wheezing at ~8pm. EKG with
   anterior TWI and ST depression ~1 mm in V3-v4. Pain resolved with nebs,
   improved breathing. Second episode of CP less severe at 11:00 pm. TWI
   in V2-V4 still present, but ST depressions slightly improved. 3rd set
   still trending up, but CKs seem plateauing. CP again at ~1:00 am, given
   morphine for pain. Pain improved with talking with nurse, who felt it
   may be partly anxiety related.
   - Hypotensive to SBPs 60s-70s on and off throughout evening. Received 2
   boluses of 500 cc IVF. UOP somewhat poor at 25-40/hr, increasing this

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with dyspnea and chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive and cardioverted for atrial flutter, developed ventricular tachycardia, and was defibrillated, returning to normal sinus rhythm. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension. 

The patient's condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock due to her baseline impaired cardiac function, superimposed arrhythmia, and possible dehydration. There is also a concern for sepsis secondary to colitis seen on CT abdomen. 

She has been diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior T wave inversion on EKG, and tachyarrhythmia. 

The patient also has subacute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.2, likely prerenal in setting of dehydration and chronic CHF. 

She has hepatitis post cholecystectomy with elevated liver function tests. 

There are concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding, guaiac positive stools. 

The patient's chronic conditions include CHF, obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis, anxiety, and a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code with consideration for less aggressive interventions such as cardio"

   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents and amio.
   - PCP agrees that medical treatment most c/w goals of care rather than
   ICD; suggests starting benzo; consider cxr and if enlarging effusion or
   evidence fluid
   overload diuresing a bit; restart flovent and consider PO steroids if
   continues to
   have respiratory difficulties; If transferred to floor would appreciate
   consultation and

   benefit from SW visit at home
   - No o/n events, rested overnight on trazadone
   - cardiac enzymes, LFT trending down
   - urine culture <10K (non-speciated)
   - TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with apical akinesis. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis (though likely ischemic colitis rather
   than infectious)
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation (no stool yet)
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia; likely demand vs ACS
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Appreciate cards consult
   - Continue ASA; discontinue atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Consider anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Cards c/s: pt with likely AVNRT on admission,
   converted to VT, then back to NSR.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver. Now trending down.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Abdominal pain resolving; colitis
   likely ischemic. Surgery consulted, recommend continue resuscitation,
   enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   - CXR given decreased BS today, crackles, fluid +
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis:
   - Change albuterol to xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;
   hold Benadryl
   - Restart flovent; consider steroids if continued respiratory
   difficulty
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now; start benzo per
   pcp
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, can start heart healthy
   diet, Folate. PPI.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation who presented with dyspnea and chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive and converted from atrial flutter to ventricular tachycardia, which required defibrillation. The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%, recent cholecystectomy, and elevated cardiac enzymes indicating possible NSTEMI. She also has subacute renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.1, now elevated to 3.2. Other medical conditions include hepatitis, abdominal pain/colitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis, anxiety, and femoral hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's baseline impaired cardiac function, along with superimposed arrhythmia, could lead to cardiogenic shock. Monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented.

2. Sepsis: The patient's mild leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT raise the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, lactate levels, and follow-up with blood cultures are necessary.

3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, likely prerenal in nature due to dehydration and chronic CHF. Gentle fluid boluses and monitoring urine output should be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis (though likely ischemic colitis rather
   than infectious)
        - D/c vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation (no stool yet)
        - follow blood, urine cultures

   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia; likely demand vs ACS
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Appreciate cards consult
   - Continue ASA 81mg PO; discontinue atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Consider anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Cards c/s: pt with likely AVNRT on admission,
   converted to VT, then back to NSR.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver. Now trending down.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Abdominal pain resolving; colitis
   likely ischemic. Surgery consulted, recommend continue resuscitation,
   enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - D/c abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   - CXR given decreased BS today, crackles, fluid +
   - Lasix 10mg IV x 1 and watch UOP
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis:
   - Change albuterol to xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;
   hold Benadryl
   - Restart flovent; consider steroids if continued respiratory
   difficulty
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now; start benzo per

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) who presents with dyspnea and chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive and converted for atrial flutter, developed ventricular tachycardia, and was defibrillated before returning to normal sinus rhythm. The patient's condition suggests multiple medical complications, including:

1. Shock: The patient likely has cardiogenic shock due to tachyarrhythmia, but it is complicated by dehydration in the setting of anorexia and nausea. There is also a possibility of sepsis due to mild leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, although the patient is afebrile and WBC count has returned to baseline with fluids.

2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): Elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior TWI on EKG indicate myocardial injury. It is unclear if this is an acute coronary syndrome or demand ischemia.

3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient initially had likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) on admission, which converted to ventricular tachycardia before returning to normal sinus rhythm. Treatment with nodal agents and amiodarone is"

   overload diuresing a bit; restart flovent and consider PO steroids if
   continues to
   have respiratory difficulties; If transferred to floor would appreciate
   consultation and
   comanagement both from general/chf cardiology and pulmonary; may
   benefit from SW visit at home
   - No o/n events, rested overnight on trazadone
   - cardiac enzymes, LFT trending down
   - urine culture <10K (non-speciated)
   - TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with apical akinesis. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation, who presented with dyspnea and chest pain. The patient was found to be hypotensive and required cardioversion for atrial flutter, which then progressed to ventricular tachycardia and was defibrillated. The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension.

The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to baseline CHF with low ejection fraction (EF 30%), superimposed arrhythmia, and dehydration. The low blood pressure and mild pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray suggest a possible hypovolemic source. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing to maintain urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. Vasodilatory source (colitis) has been treated empirically with antibiotics, and lactate levels are being trended.

2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): Elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior T-wave inversion on EKG indicate an acute coronary syndrome. The patient is on aspirin and statins, and anticoagulation therapy will be initiated if there is a continued enzyme rise. Morphine is being given for pain"

   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral
   gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion...Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2105-6-12**], the mitral regurgitation may be increased (may
   have been underestimated due to shadowing ), and the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is further reduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely cardiogenic in setting of tachyarrhythmia but
   complicated by likely dehydration in setting of anorexia and nausea,
   together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline impaired
   cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR,
   chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC to
   baseline with fluids.
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia; however CXR not concerning for congestion)
        - check TTE
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat empirically with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff given recent history of diarrhea though now with
   constipation
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA; discontinue atorvastatin if LFTs continue
   to be abnormal
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise (start heparin now that INR
   within range)
   - Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   .
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Cards F/U: follow up final recs; prelim recs include continue abx,
   maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct, consider imdur/hydral once GI issues
   stable, continue ASA but avoid other anticoagulants, cath if pt
   agreeable and c/w goals of care (though cardiac enzymes likely [**3-16**]
   demand ischemia); arrhythmias on admission likely AVNRT -> VT, treat
   with nodal agents + amio
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - hold coumadin for now
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT. Surgery consulted, recommend continue
   resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric abx. Pt is s/p
   cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools:
   - Follow Hct; give PPI
   - Repeat stool guaiac when disimpacted
   .
   # CHF:  Hold lasix while hypotensive; hold Metoprolol, ACE-I,
   spironolactone while hypotensive
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis: Change albuterol to
   xopenex, cromolyn spray, fluticasone inhaler;  hold benadryl
   # Anxiety: Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, can start heart healthy
   diet, Folate. PPI.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  DNR DNI but consider less aggressive interventions such as
   cardiovert/defib if short-term return to baseline status (see OMR note

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation who presents with dyspnea and chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive and converted from atrial flutter to ventricular tachycardia, defibrillated, and returned to normal sinus rhythm. She is admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including cardiogenic shock, NSTEMI, tachyarrhythmia, subacute renal failure, hepatitis, abdominal pain/colitis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and chronic obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis. She is currently on various medications and has several allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's baseline CHF with low ejection fraction, along with superimposed arrhythmia, may contribute to cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, and timely administration of appropriate interventions are necessary.
2. NSTEMI: Elevated troponins, CK-MB, and anterior TWI on EKG indicate a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Management should include continuing atorvastatin, ASA, and anticoagulation if there is a continued rise in cardiac enzymes.
3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has experienced a-flutter and ventricular tachyc"
