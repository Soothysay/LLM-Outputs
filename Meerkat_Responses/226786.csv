   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
    TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Differential includes CVA or TIA,
   toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure) or infection (potential sources include lung with
   possible aspiration given decreased mental status over last few days,
   indwelling port, urinary infection, CNS though story is less convincing
   for this), seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain
   metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. Suspect that some degree is likely
   from poor perfusion in setting of hypovolemia and hypotension. Recent
   use of oxycodone could also be contributing to depressed mental status.
   To pull together the story, suspect this is a case of hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and narcotics in
   setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits as noted
   and exacerbation of old CVA deficits.
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Consider neurology consult in AM if mental status not improved with
   above interventions, would also consider additional imaging such as MRI
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility. In setting of thromcytopenia, anemia, and altered mental
   status, TTP/HUS is also a possibility, but no schistocytes or rise in
   T. Bili. She has no known metastates in the pelvis that would account
   for obstruction.
   - Urine electrolytes being sent
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - Repeat peripheral smear in AM to again check for schistocytes
   - Checking urine eosinophils
   - Currently making fairly good urine, will continue to monitor output
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85,
   or if symptomatic, however will use D5 with three amps of bicarb given
   metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to renal failure), and will need
   to be mindful of her cardiomyopathy.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet could of 68 on presentation. She is day
   18 of her gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow
   suppression from that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up
   secondary to administration of GSC-F). Baseline prior to this appears
   to vary, likely secondary to cycles of chemotherapy (75-400's). TTP/HUS
   is consideration as noted above, but no schistocytes, T. Bili is
   normal, no fevers.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED). Will also rule out hemolysis by checking laboratories, however
   no schistocytes on smear noted.
   - Hemolysis labs, reticulocyte count
   - Type and cross, repeat HCT now and likely transfuse two units of
   PRBCs
   - Checking B12, folate, iron (MCV is 109), as suspect poor nutrition
   intake of these
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Differential includes
   secondary to uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis
   started around same time as she started oxycodone, and reported
   incidence of pruritis is up to 12-13%), worsening liver disease (she
   has known metastases).
   - Checking LFT's, renal failure management as noted above
   - Checking TSH, ferritin
   - Sarna PRN, holding off on benadryl or atarax as these may cloud
   assessment of mental status
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology. Patient currently unable to
   give further details. In setting of possible urinary retention, cauda
   equina syndrome is a consideration, but patient currently without
   sensory deficits with normal rectal tone and discomfort with rectal
   thermometer. Response to oxycodone also is less consistent with cord
   compression. She has known bony metastases of her pelvis and spine, so
   these could also be causing pain (eg via nerve impingement or
   pathologic fracture)
   - Start with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or
   pelvis/hip fracture
   - Consider further imaging of spine in AM if/once patient is more
   stable
   - Should she develop new deficits, would consider initiation of
   steroids for question of cord compression
   - Continue oxycodone for pain control
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on coumadin, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and cardiomyopathy. She presents with altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- Heart rate: 87 bpm
- Blood pressure: 98/77 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

Her physical examination reveals that she is an elderly thin female appearing somewhat confused, with no conjunctival pallor, regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, soft abdomen, and warm extremities with bilateral ecchymoses over the tibias. Neurological examination shows left leg 4-/5 strength, right leg 3-/5 strength, toe down-going on left, and up-going on right.

Laboratory results indicate:
- Hemoglobin: 7.4 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 22.6%
- White blood cell count: 4.5 K/uL
- Platelet count: 68 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
- Glucose: 89 mg/dL
- Sodium: 113 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L
- Chloride: 18 mEq/L
- Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Altered mental status: Possible causes include CVA/TIA, toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances or infection (lung, indwelling port, urinary infection), seizures with post-ictal state in the setting of brain metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's recent use of oxycodone could also contribute to the depressed mental status.
2. Acute renal failure: Possible causes include pre-renal azotemia due to poor PO intake and continued home blood pressure medications, post-obstructive etiology, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS).
3. Thrombocytopenia: Possible causes include marrow suppression from chemotherapy, TTP/HUS, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Anemia: Possible causes include marrow suppression from chemotherapy, chronic disease, or hemolysis.
5. Pruritis: Possible causes include uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis started around the same time as oxycodone), worsening liver disease (known metastases).
6. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology, possibly related to urinary retention or bony metastases.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8562**] has had one unit pRBC's with some improvement in HCt and
   renal function. She continues to be quite agitated and complains of
   pruritus. She denies pain. Her husband is at her bedside.
   Exam notable for frail elderly woman with BP of 98/77 HR of 104 RR of
   24  with sats of 100% on RA. Her MM are dry and she has clear lung
   sounds with a supple neck. kegs are edematous and wih some anterior
   bruising.
    Labs notable for WBC of 4.7 K, HCT 26.9 , K+4.6 , Cr 1.7 , lactate<
   2.0 and INR of 5.3 CXR with possible infiltrate at left base but no
   evidence for interstitial edema.
   Agree with plan to support with IVF's, blood products and antibiotics
   for possible aspiration PNA.  LFT's, renal function will hopefully
   improve over next 24 hrs. If mental status does not improve, then EEG
   may be necessary. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] will be consulted who follows her closely.
   She may need hospice level care if she does not improve over next 48
   hrs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above. Husband has been updated regarding
   plans today

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Differential includes CVA or TIA,
   toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure) or infection (potential sources include lung with
   possible aspiration given decreased mental status over last few days,
   indwelling port, urinary infection, CNS though story is less convincing
   for this), seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain
   metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. Suspect that some degree is likely
   from poor perfusion in setting of hypovolemia and hypotension. Recent
   use of oxycodone could also be contributing to depressed mental status.
   To pull together the story, suspect this is a case of hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and narcotics in
   setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits as noted
   and exacerbation of old CVA deficits.
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Consider neurology consult in AM if mental status not improved with
   above interventions, would also consider additional imaging such as MRI
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction.. In setting of thromcytopenia, anemia,
   and altered mental status, TTP/HUS is also a possibility, but no
   schistocytes or rise in T. Bili.
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - Repeat peripheral smear in AM to again check for schistocytes
   - Urine eos neg
   - Currently making fairly good urine, will continue to monitor output
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85,
   or if symptomatic, however will use D5 with three amps of bicarb given
   metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to renal failure), and will need
   to be mindful of her cardiomyopathy.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Baseline prior to this appears to vary,
   likely secondary to cycles of chemotherapy (75-400's). TTP/HUS is
   consideration as noted above, but no schistocytes, T. Bili is normal,
   no fevers.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED). Will also rule out hemolysis by checking laboratories, however
   no schistocytes on smear noted.
   - Hemolysis labs
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Differential includes
   secondary to uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis
   started around same time as she started oxycodone, and reported
   incidence of pruritis is up to 12-13%), worsening liver disease (she
   has known metastases).
   - Checking LFT's, renal failure management as noted above
   - Checking TSH, ferritin
   - Sarna PRN, holding off on benadryl or atarax as these may cloud
   assessment of mental status
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology. Patient currently unable to
   give further details. In setting of possible urinary retention, cauda
   equina syndrome is a consideration, but patient currently without
   sensory deficits with normal rectal tone and discomfort with rectal
   thermometer. Response to oxycodone also is less consistent with cord
   compression. She has known bony metastases of her pelvis and spine, so
   these could also be causing pain (eg via nerve impingement or
   pathologic fracture)
   - Start with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or
   pelvis/hip fracture
   - Consider further imaging of spine in AM if/once patient is more
   stable
   - Should she develop new deficits, would consider initiation of
   steroids for question of cord compression
   - Continue oxycodone for pain control
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Consult placed, PO diet once more stable.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**], a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, presents with altered mental status. She has received blood transfusion and her hemoglobin concentration has been increased. Her vital signs are stable, but she shows signs of agitation, paranoia, and confusion. Neurological examination reveals left leg weakness and right arm contracture. She has bilateral leg ecchymosis and signs of venous stasis. Laboratory results indicate renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and liver dysfunction. The patient's plan includes holding antibiotics, following up on culture data, and assessing for evolving neurological processes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient presents with confusion, agitation, and paranoia. This could be due to hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, worsening liver function tests, or narcotics in the setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits. Other likely contributors include toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances, left lower lobe infiltrate (likely aspiration), CVA or TIA, infection of indwelling port, seizures with post-ictal state in the setting of brain metastases, intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema, or medication side effects.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her

   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy. She presents with altered mental status, weakness, and hypoperfusion. The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which can be due to various reasons such as hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, renal failure, worsening liver function abnormalities, and narcotics. It is important to closely monitor her mental status and provide appropriate supportive care.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes, post-obstructive etiology, or intrinsic renal damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be secondary to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding is necessary, and transfusion should be considered if the count is below 20K or if symptoms are present.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may also be attributed to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. Appropriate transfusion support should be provided, aiming for a hematocrit level above 30%.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on coumadin, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and cardiomyopathy. She presents with altered mental status, weakness, and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure of 147/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, analgesics, and cardiac support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors such as hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening liver function abnormalities, and narcotics. It is important to closely monitor the patient's mental status and provide appropriate supportive care.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. This could be caused by pre-renal factors due to poor oral intake and the continuation of home blood pressure medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Another possibility is post-obstructive etiology despite the absence of known metastases in the pelvis. Close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.  Pt still
   has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and mild edema.
   Plan:
   -Hypocalcemia: repleated Ca2+
   - Will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] the possibility of leptomeningeal dz and
   whether LP and cytology would help.  Unable to get MRI given pt has
   severe clostrophobia.  Holding ibuprofen and coumadin given possibility
   of LP.
   -Bacterial meningitis in ddx but no meningeal sign/fever: pt already on
   ceftriaxone and vancomycin for PNA.  If concern for meningitis
   increases would start ampicillin.
   -Infection: LLL infiltrate likely.  Continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   f/u blood cx still pending, urine cx negative
   -Goal MAP >55-60
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy
   -Haldol prn for agitation
   -Avoid narcotics and benadryl as much as possible
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal
   (fena 0.1%) in setting of poor PO intake reported by family and
   continuation of home BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her
   baseline creatinine is 0.5.  Trend of creatinine 2.3 -> 1.9 -> 1.7 ->
   0.8.
   -continue to trend creatinine
   .
   #PNA: continue cetriaxone and vancomycin.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.  Today  pt normotensive (required fluid bolus earlier in
   admission).
   .
   #Increased LFTs
   -RUQ u/s today
   -follow LFTs
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 19 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   -.
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and atorax prn.
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with low doses of tylenol or ibuprofen.
   .
   #SVT:
   -metoprolol 5mg IV Prn for HR >120
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic and now
   subtherapeutic. No current signs of bleeding or history of bleeding.
   - Holding coumadin given possibility of LP, type and cross sent in
   event she needs to be urgently reversed.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with low doses of tylenol (given LFTs) and low doses
   ibuprofen (given kidney fx).

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing altered mental status, delirium, confusion, and have a history of malignancy with widespread metastasis. The patient also has hypovolemia, hypocalcemia, pruritus, agitation, renal failure, and potential infections such as line-related infection or meningitis. Nutritional support is being provided via nasogastric tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient may be at risk for various infections due to the indwelling IV catheter and potential line-related infection. Empirical antimicrobials have been started to address this concern.
2. Malignancy: The extensive and widely metastatic malignancy poses a significant complication for the patient. It could contribute to the altered mental status and overall poor condition.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which requires correction to prevent any associated complications.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient has hypovolemia, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further fluid depletion and potential shock.
6. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which could be related to the underlying process or medication effects. Symptomatic treatment and addressing the underlying cause are essential.
7. Pruritus: The patient is experiencing pruritus, and symptomatic treatment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient experienced tachycardia that responded to IV beta-blocker. Mental status revealed disorientation and confusion. The patient has a history of malignancy with widespread metastasis and possible infection, including line-related infection. There is evidence of volume depletion, renal failure, hypocalcemia, and agitation. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and treatment for various conditions, including delirium, pruritus, renal failure, malignancy, and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status is altered, indicating delirium. This can be caused by toxic/metabolic response to pneumonia, hypocalcemia, CNS infection (meningitis, abscess), leptomeningeal involvement of tumor, increased/progression of CNS tumor, encephalitis, or medication effect.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient has volume depletion, which may contribute to renal failure. Close monitoring and IV fluids are recommended.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which should be corrected to prevent complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.  Pt still
   has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and mild edema.
   Plan:
   -Hypocalcemia: repleated Ca2+
   - Will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] the possibility of leptomeningeal dz and
   whether LP and cytology would help.  Unable to get MRI given pt has
   severe clostrophobia.  Holding ibuprofen and coumadin given possibility
   of LP.
   -Bacterial meningitis in ddx but no meningeal sign/fever: pt already on
   ceftriaxone and vancomycin for PNA.  If concern for meningitis
   increases would start ampicillin.
   -Infection: LLL infiltrate likely.  Continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   f/u blood cx still pending, urine cx negative
   -Goal MAP >55-60
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy
   -Haldol prn for agitation
   -Avoid narcotics and benadryl as much as possible
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal
   (fena 0.1%) in setting of poor PO intake reported by family and
   continuation of home BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her
   baseline creatinine is 0.5.  Trend of creatinine 2.3 -> 1.9 -> 1.7 ->
   0.8.
   -continue to trend creatinine
   .
   #PNA: continue cetriaxone and vancomycin.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.  Today  pt normotensive (required fluid bolus earlier in
   admission).
   .
   #Increased LFTs
   -RUQ u/s today
   -follow LFTs
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 19 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   -.
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and atorax prn.
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with low doses of tylenol or ibuprofen.
   .
   #SVT:
   -metoprolol 5mg IV Prn for HR >120
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic and now
   subtherapeutic. No current signs of bleeding or history of bleeding.
   - Holding coumadin given possibility of LP, type and cross sent in
   event she needs to be urgently reversed.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with low doses of tylenol (given LFTs) and low doses
   ibuprofen (given kidney fx).

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status and feeling of
   weakness on left side.  Has weakness on right side at baseline.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Pt had AMS on admission and thru [**2145-3-22**],
   oriented only to self and was combative.  On [**2145-3-23**] her mental status
   improved dramatically.  Thought likely to be toxic/metabolic factors in
   the setting of old CVA deficits. The toxic/metabolic factors could
   include PNA, oxycodone use, and possible small contribution of
   hypocalcemia.  There was concern for leptomeningeal disease given her
   metastatic breast cancer to the cerebellum, however, LP was not
   persueed given pt's mental status cleared and we would not expect it to
   resolve spontaneously.  Seizure could also be responsible if AMS was
   secondary to seizure. CT of the head was negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed,
   or new edema.  Pt still has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and
   mild edema.  She refused MRI given her severe clostrophobia.  Her
   oxycodone was discontinued and her calcium was repleated.  Pt did
   receive antibiotics for bacterial meningitis in the ED but they were
   not continued given that she had no fever or signs of meningismus.
   -d/c lactulose (was given for concern for hepatic encephalopathy )
   -avoid narcotics, low dose inbuprofen and Tylenol for pain.
   .
   #. PNA: Left retrocardiac mild PNA.
   -continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   -f/u final on blood cx still pending
   .
   # Increased LFTs: RUQ was done for concern of rising LFTs given pt has
   liver mets.
   -Some biliary sludge found on RUQ ultrasound.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Pt was pre-renal (FENA 0.1%) in setting of
   poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home BP
   medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is 0.5.
   Her creatinine on admission was 2.3. Pt had received fluid boluses
   early on in the admission for hypotension.
   -creatinine today at 0.6
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive on admission to 67 SBP and she
   received fluid boluses. Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.
   -consider restarting BP meds tomorrow.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She was day 18 of
   her gemcitabine therapy so this liekly represent marrow suppression
   from that cycle. (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia. Her coumadin was held. Her
   thrombocytonpenia improved to the 130s today.
   -continue to follow daily plts
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  Her hemolysis labs were negative.  Poor
   reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively. She received one unit of
   blood while in the ICU and bumped appropriately.  HCT stable at 28.8 on
   [**2145-3-23**].
   -daily HCT check
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week prior to admission. Most
   likely secondary to oxycodone.  She was treated with benedryl which was
   later discontinued due to her MS changes.
   -consider atarax prn puritis
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   She had no signs of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and
   sensation in tact. She was pain free on day of call out from ICU.
   -ibuprofen (low dose) or tylenol (low dose given liver fx) for pain
   control.
   .
   #SVT: Pt had 2 episodes of SVT while in the ICU with HR up to 150 which
   responded to metoprolol 5IV. No episodes of SVT on [**2145-3-23**].
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Not active pt while an in patient.
   -tx plan per primary oncologist
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR. She was seen by nutrition and
   originally placed on a restriceted diet.
   -advanced diet to soft dysphagia
   -continue supplement with boost/ensure.
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission.
   She had no signs of bleeding.  Anticoagulation was held in anticipation
   of LP. Coumadin restarted on [**2145-3-23**] at 3mg daily down from home dose
   of 5mg daily given that she was supratherapeutic and also on
   antibiotics.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Held ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in setting
   of hypotension.
   -consider restarting tomorrow.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Altered Mental Status: The patient had altered mental status on admission and until March 22nd, but her mental status improved dramatically on March 23rd. The likely cause of AMS was identified as toxic/metabolic factors, possibly due to pneumonia, oxycodone use, and hypocalcemia. A CT scan of the head ruled out any new edema or bleeding.
- Pneumonia: The patient has left retrocardiac mild pneumonia, for which she is being treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

The patient's condition has shown some improvement over time, with reduced agitation and better cooperation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications including levofloxacin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/46 mmHg to 150/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, but they are overweight and have no signs of well-nourished appearance. The patient's eyes are normal with no conjunctival edema or sclera icterus. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs or extra heart sounds. The respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with no wheezing or crackles. The abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds and no tenderness. The extremities are warm and well perfused with no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. There is no evidence of paralysis or abnormal tone.
