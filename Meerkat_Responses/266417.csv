   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 94 kg overweight man who presented with chest pain, hyperglycemia, and hyperkalemia. He was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive, and it was determined that he had developed complete heart block. The patient's hyperglycemia likely resulted in hyponatremia and subsequent heart block and collapse. He was in a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient developed complete heart block, which is a condition where the electrical signals from the upper chambers of the heart (atria) fail to reach the lower chambers (ventricles). This can lead to a significantly reduced heart rate and inadequate pumping of blood.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient had high levels of potassium in his blood, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications such as muscle weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, and kidney damage.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient had signs of DKA, a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. DKA can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ damage.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels increased rapidly, indicating possible acute kidney injury. This can be caused by factors such as hypotension, dehydration, or direct kidney injury.

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was also
   dramatically hyperkalemic and hyperglycemic on presentation.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiologies include infarctive, related to electrolyte disturbance
   (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), toxic (accidental versus intentional).
   Infarction unlikely given enzyems, atypical for electrolyte
   disturbance, more likely toxic. Prolonged QRS could relate to either
   toxicity, particularly with tricyclics, but may also results from
   hyperkalemia. Patient takes metoprolol at home, is somewhat erratic
   with medications and did not respond to atropine. Concerning for
   beta-blocker overdose, toxic and ischemic. UTox and STox panels
   negative (including for ASA).
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction as above
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below)
   - Toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Coming down with correction of hyperglycemia. Insulin, calcium chloride
   in ED, as above. Unclear cause: S/p infarcted tissue worth considering,
   but lactate 3.0. Tumor lysis unlikely based on normal CBC, but need to
   check LDH. Toxicology clear.
   - Continue insulin IV drip (started at 10, gave another 20 bolus and
   running at 15 now).
   - Will give Kayexelate later
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (50%, 550 cc, 22 BPM, PEEP 8 cm
   H2O).
   - Continue until stable lab values, then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes q8h
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Repeat echo when improved
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension appears out of proportion to
   bradycardia. Now paced and hypertensive. Will allow to be slightly
   hypertensive at present, given that we do not know typical range (but
   likely has untreated hypertension). Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk
   of cerebral hypoperfusion in this patient.
   - Presently elevated with pacing and depressed slightly by vent and
   sedation.
   - Follow and re-titrate medications.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. Likely role in above. Hemoglobin glycosylation is
   time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor control and chronicity more
   than this acute event.
   - Continue IV insulin until WNLs
   - Then order ISS
   - A1c
   - Fluids - now 1.5 L
   - When K below 5.3 will start 40 mEq L 1/2 NS.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7, now, later the
   same day, is 1.3. Likely hypotension resulted in very poor renal
   perfusion. Urine output is adequate now (~ 1 L today). Concern for ATN.
   Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic kidney disease. Urine output
   in course of writing note dropped to 15 mL/hr without sings of fluid
   overload
   - Urine Osms and lytes.
   - Urine protein to creatinine ratio.
   - Bolus 500 mL NS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current clinical findings, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Complete heart block: The patient presents with bradycardia and complete heart block. The etiology is unclear, but it could be due to infarction, electrolyte disturbance (such as hyperkalemia), or toxic effects (such as beta-blocker overdose). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in their blood, which can be life-threatening if not corrected promptly. Insulin, calcium chloride, and Kayexelate are being used to manage this condition.

3. Respiratory status: The patient is sedated and intubated. Weaning off sedation and extubation will be considered once stable lab values are achieved.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has two-vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology is possible, particularly if the sinus node has been affected. Enzyme levels are being monitored, and further investigations such as a repeat 12-lead EKG and echocardiogram may be necessary.

5. Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive but has now become hypertensive due to pacing. Blood pressure will be closely monitored and medications adjusted accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Complete heart block: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension are likely due to a complete heart block, possibly caused by hyperkalemia and hyponatremia resulting from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This condition requires continuous monitoring of the EKG and telemetry.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels are likely secondary to acute-on-chronic hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy has been initiated to correct the potassium levels and prevent further complications. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is necessary.

3. Respiratory status: The patient is currently sedated and intubated due to combativeness in the emergency department. Weaning off sedation and extubation will be considered once the patient's lab values stabilize.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has two-vessel coronary artery disease, which could be the underlying cause of his chest pain. Enzyme levels are currently flat, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction at this time. However, further evaluation with additional enzyme tests, telemetry monitoring, and repeat 12-lead EKG is recommended.

5. Hypertension: The patient's initial hypotension may have been missed, and there is evidence of hypertension when pacing was reduced and the patient developed sinus rhythm. The goal is to maintain systolic blood pressure above 110 mm Hg while"

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is dizziness/CP/heart block. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient appears to have developed complete heart block, likely due to hyperglycemia resulting in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia.

2. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient was found bradycardic and hypotensive, suggesting a possible junctional rhythm.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in the blood, which is likely secondary to acute-on-chronic hyperglycemia. This condition needs to be corrected with insulin and careful monitoring of potassium levels.

4. Complete heart block: The patient has been diagnosed with complete heart block, possibly due to electrolyte disturbances. Further evaluation for ischemia/infarction is needed, and the patient may require a permanent pacemaker depending on the underlying cause.

5. Respiratory status: The patient is currently sedated and intubated. There is no indication for continued intubation, and the plan is to wean sedation and extubate the patient once stable lab values are achieved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II presenting with dizziness, chest pain, and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient likely experienced hyperglycemia resulting in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, leading to heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension, and collapse. This condition requires immediate management with insulin and correction of electrolyte imbalances.

2. Complete heart block: The patient developed complete heart block, which is a serious condition where the electrical signals from the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial node) are not properly conducted to the ventricles. This can result in bradycardia and even cardiac arrest. The patient is currently being paced transvenously, but long-term management may require a permanent pacemaker.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, likely secondary to acute on chronic hyperglycemia. Insulin administration and correction of potassium levels are necessary to address this issue.

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.
   Consider infection given fever, specifically community acquired PNA as
   pt with aspiration risk and making purulent sputum. CNS infection on
   the ddx, however pt unable to cooperate for LP. Brain stem infarction
   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given
   agitation. Lowest on the list is TTP, given thrombocytopenia, AMS,
   hematuria, however pt without significant anemia and thrombocytopenia
   mild.
   - Check hemolysis labs for e/o hemolytic anemia
   - Consider LP if mental status does not improve and pt able to
   cooperate

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of dizziness, chest pain, and heart block. He was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic by the EMS. The patient appears to have developed a complete heart block, which was likely caused by hyperglycemia resulting in hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia. This led to hypotension and his collapse. The patient also has an altered mental status, possibly due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, but toxicology results are negative. There is a concern for infection, specifically community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), given the fever and purulent sputum. Other possible causes of altered mental status include central nervous system (CNS) infection, brain stem infarction, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient initially presented with complete heart block, which has since resolved. It is likely that hyperkalemia caused the AV blocks.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient had resolved hyperkalemia. Monitoring is recommended.
3. Hypertension: The patient has baseline hypertension and experienced acute hypertension in the morning, likely due to agitation.
4. Coronary artery disease: No active issues. Continue ASA and statin.
5. Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state: Resolved"

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

   Vastly improved today. Likely encephalopathy from sedation (occurs in
   30%^ patients with intubation and sedation). Appears not to have

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Complete heart block: The patient initially experienced chest pain and was found to have bradycardia and hypotension. This suggests the possibility of a complete heart block, which has since resolved.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient developed severe hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and heart block. This condition has been resolved.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, but it is important to monitor kidney function closely.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and it is important to continue monitoring for any new issues related to this condition.

5. Hypertension: The patient has baseline hypertension, and there were episodes of acute hypertension. It is necessary to manage blood pressure and avoid medications that could cause reflex tachycardia.

6. Delirium/confusion: The patient had altered mental status due to encephalopathy from sedation. It is important to minimize psychotropic medications and monitor for further episodes of delirium or confusion.

7. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): Although the clinical exam does not strongly indicate pneumonia, there are signs of potential infection. The patient is being treated for CAP, and further evaluation of the sputum culture is needed.

8. Thrombocytopenia: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old overweight man with altered mental status who was admitted to the ICU due to chest pain, bradycardia, and hypotension. He appears to have developed complete heart block. The patient also presented with a hyperosmolar, likely non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. The hyperglycemia resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which led to heart block, junctional rhythm, hypotension, and his collapse.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has vastly improved today. It is likely encephalopathy from sedation. Mental status will likely continue to improve.
- Minimize psychotropics, stop Haldol, and continue on PRN basis only.
- Stop CIWA.
- Haldol for intractable agitation, with caution.
- Daily EKGs to monitor QTc.

2. CAP (pneumonia): Patchy LLL opacity on wet read and with fever and purulent sputum would be concerned for CAP. Periintubation. Poor inspiratory film. No leukocytosis, but did have brief fever. CXR possible fluid. Will follow closely. Clinical exam not consistent with PNA. Nonetheless, will continue Rx for CAP.
- F/u CXR final read.
- Continue azithromycin.

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.
   Consider infection given fever, specifically community acquired PNA as
   pt with aspiration risk and making purulent sputum. CNS infection on
   the ddx, however pt unable to cooperate for LP. Brain stem infarction
   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given
   agitation. Lowest on the list is TTP, given thrombocytopenia, AMS,
   hematuria, however pt without significant anemia and thrombocytopenia
   mild.
   - Check hemolysis labs for e/o hemolytic anemia
   - Consider LP if mental status does not improve and pt able to
   cooperate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 94 kg overweight man who is agitated and sedated, with restraints applied. He has a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. His blood pressure is high, and he has tachycardia (heart rate of 107 bpm) and increased respiratory rate (26 breaths per minute). The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%. He is on multiple medications including haloperidol, labetalol, heparin sodium, and others. The patient has a history of chest pain and was found bradycardic and hypotensive by EMS. He appears to have developed complete heart block. The patient also has a hyperosmolar, likely non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. His hyperglycemia resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn caused heart block, hypotension, and his collapse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal, infection (such as community-acquired pneumonia), central nervous system infection, or brain stem infarction. Further evaluation is needed, including a lumbar puncture if the patient's mental status does not improve and if he is able to cooperate. An MRI or CT scan may also be necessary if the patient's mental status does not improve and if he is able to cooperate.

2. Complete heart block"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old man who presented with chest pain and was found to have bradycardia and hypotension. He appears to have developed complete heart block and is believed to have experienced a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. The hyperglycemia may have resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, leading to heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension, and his collapse. The patient's altered mental status has improved significantly and is expected to continue improving. He will be monitored closely for any signs of delirium or confusion. 

The patient also has a patchy opacity in the left lower lobe on chest X-ray, along with fever and purulent sputum, which raises concerns for pneumonia. However, the clinical exam does not fully support this diagnosis. Therefore, the patient will continue to receive antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and follow-up chest X-rays will be performed. 

Thrombocytopenia is also noted, possibly secondary to heart failure or acute infection. The patient's platelet count will be monitored, and if it continues to fall, subcutaneous heparin will be discontinued.

Other medical complications that can arise include acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient will be closely monitored for any signs of these conditions and appropriate treatment will be provided if necessary."
