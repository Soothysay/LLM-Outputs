   Assessment and Plan
   89 F w/ PMHx of hypothyroid, prior syncopal episodes of unknown
   etiology presents w/ syncope and high degree AV block, now s/p
   temporary pacer placement.
   #) Syncope:  Secondary to AV block versus seizures with increased vagal
   tone.  Patient
s telemetry demonstrates increased vagal tone during
   asystolic episode where P-P intervals also increased during the high
   degree block.  This may suggest seizures with increased vagal outflow
   as an etiology, which fits clinically with the episodes of
blank
   stares
 that patient
s son describes.
   - F/U EEG results, so far no seizure activity or capture of temporary
   pacer wires.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP following, temp wire in place, rate set at 50.  Plan to place PPM
   today or tomorrow.
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Pacer pads in place, temp pacer wire in place
   - neuro c/s appreciated, f/u recs
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   #) Restless Leg Syndrome: will decrease mirapex to 0.75 mg qhs, no
   evidence of arrhythmia effects of medication, prn low dose bzds as
   adjunct.
   #) Osteoporosis: continue fosamax, calcium, vitamin d
   #) Prophylaxis: taking PO, sc heparin, bowel regimen, aspirin for
   primary prevention

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   per housestaff. nothing to add
   Physical Examination

   Medical Decision Making
   per housestaff. nothing to add
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   no recurrent bradycardia./syncope
   eeg pending
   will likely require pacemaker regardless of eeg findings due to
   prolonged bradycardia

","The patient is an elderly woman who presented with syncope and high-degree AV block. She has a history of hypothyroidism and prior syncopal episodes of unknown etiology. The patient was placed on temporary pacing wires and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 128/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in her head, neck, or lungs. Her abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds, and her extremities show no signs of edema or cyanosis. Neurologically, she is alert and oriented, with intact cranial nerves, normal motor function, and no sensory deficits. 

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal range, including Troponin-T, which is less than 0.01.

The patient's assessment includes ongoing monitoring for syncope, hypothyroidism, restless leg syndrome, osteoporosis, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an elderly woman who presented with syncope and high-degree AV block. She has a medical history of hypothyroidism and prior syncopal episodes of unknown etiology. The patient underwent temporary pacer placement and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/55 mmHg to 102/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in her general appearance, neck, lungs, abdomen, extremities, lymphatics, or skin. However, her neurologic examination shows normal mental status, cranial nerves intact, motor function with normal bulk, strength, and tone, sensory function without deficits, cerebellar function without nystagmus or dysarthria, and deep tendon reflexes that are 2+ bilaterally with a flexor plantar response.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal hemoglobin and leukocyte levels, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, low potassium, and normal glucose levels. Her cardiac markers are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include further investigation into the cause of her syn"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 F w/ PMHx of hypothyroid, prior syncopal episodes of unknown
   etiology presents w/ syncope and high degree AV block, now s/p
   temporary pacer placement.
   #) Syncope:  Secondary to AV block versus seizures with increased vagal
   tone.  Patient
s telemetry demonstrates increased vagal tone during
   asystolic episode where P-P intervals also increased during the high
   degree block.  This may suggest seizures with increased vagal outflow
   as an etiology, which fits clinically with the episodes of
blank
   stares
 that patient
s son describes.
   - F/U EEG results, so far no seizure activity or capture of temporary
   pacer wires.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP following, temp wire in place, rate set at 50.  Plan to place PPM
   today or tomorrow.
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Pacer pads in place, temp pacer wire in place
   - neuro c/s appreciated, f/u recs
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   #) Restless Leg Syndrome: will decrease mirapex to 0.75 mg qhs, no
   evidence of arrhythmia effects of medication, prn low dose bzds as
   adjunct.
   #) Osteoporosis: continue fosamax, calcium, vitamin d
   #) Prophylaxis: taking PO, sc heparin, bowel regimen, aspirin for
   primary prevention
   #) FEN:  Regular diet, replete lytes prn, NPO after MN for PPM
   placement
   #) Access: PIV, RIJ placed [**2-22**] with pacer wire in place
   #) Code: full
   #) DISPO: CCU for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an elderly woman with a medical history of hypothyroidism and prior syncopal episodes of unknown etiology.
- She presented with syncope and a high-degree AV block, for which a temporary pacer was placed.
- The patient's symptoms, including episodes of blank stares described by her son, suggest seizures with increased vagal outflow as an etiology.
- Further evaluation is needed to confirm this hypothesis, including follow-up EEG results to capture any seizure activity or temporary pacer wire effects.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/55 mmHg to 163/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 870 mL and output of 1,650 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of 780 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with SpO2 at 99% and ABG results of ///29/.
- Physical examination reveals general alertness, clear lungs, supple neck, normal heart sounds, soft abdomen, and no abnormalities in extremities or lymphatics.
