   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is a 85 year-old female with CHF, afib, HTN, CKD, recent fall,
   presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia,
   and acute renal failure.
   .
   #  Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely infectious.  Fits criteria for
   sepsis with likely source being pulmonary with new effusion and
   infiltrate.  UA negative.  Blood and urine cultures are pending.  She
   initially defervesced after receiving antibiotics and tylenol, however
   spiked a temp again o/n
   - cont levofloxacin for empiric coverage of CAP
   - tylenol prn
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - f/u blood and urine cx

   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pt with worsening renal failure
   o/n, thought to be pre-renal in the context of infection and decreased
   PO intake.  Also appears to be pre-renal based on urine lytes however
   creatinine is not improving with hydration and UOP remains low.
   Increasing concern for ATN.
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr
   - renally dose medications
   - follow fluid status, electrolytes, UOP
   .
   #  Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to volume depletion in the
   setting of decreased PO intake and insensible losses from
   infection/fevers.  Was fluid responsive, now hemodynamically stable,
   though relatively hypotensive given she carries a history of
   hypertension on multiple anti-hypertensive meds as an outpatient.
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<60 or UOP<30cc/h
   - if hct continues to drop, will give RBC transfusion for volume load
   .
   #  Bilateral pleural effusions:  New compared to CXR from one year
   ago.  Likely secondary to CHF exacerbation.  BNP 2200, baseline not
   known.  EF is unknown, pt is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1140**] (cardiology) as an
   outpatient.  Could have also developed cardiac ischemia secondary to
   demand in the setting of blood loss anemia or as a primary event
   related to his fall.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Likely
   contributing to hypoxia.
   - trend CK, trop x 3
   - holding off on diuresis in setting of infection/intravascular
   depletion
   .
   #  Acute anemia:  Concern for blood loss secondary to fall one week
   ago, possible hematomas at shoulder and right hip.  Hct dropped from
   34.6 one month ago to 26.9 today.  MCV is 91.  Nl platelet count.  No
   history of anemia.  No history of recent observed bleeding.

   - transfuse < 25, [**Male First Name (un) 194**] with lasix given CHF
   - add-on iron studies, hemolysis labs
   - hold aspirin

   #  Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to hypovolemia.  Also on the
   differential would be SIADH, CHF, drug-induced (HCTZ).
   - cont to monitor
   - will repeat Na now s/p volume repletion
   - holding HCTZ
   - consider SIADH work-up if does not improve
   #  s/p Fall:  Sounds consistent with mechanical fall.  No evidence of
   fracture or ICH.  Large echymoses concerning for hematomas as cause for
   anemia.
   - tylenol prn for pain control
   - management of anemia as above
   .
   #  Atrial fibrillation:  Will need to clarify history with outpatient
   cardiologist.  Currently in NSR.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, indicating that there may be suspicion of bacterial infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of malaise, cough, hypoxia, and fever, along with the presence of new bilateral pleural effusions, fit the criteria for sepsis. Empiric coverage for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been initiated with levofloxacin.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has worsening renal failure, likely secondary to pre-renal causes due to infection and decreased oral intake. There is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the unresponsiveness of creatinine to hydration and low urine output.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly secondary to volume depletion in the setting of decreased oral intake and insensible losses from infection/fevers. Fluid responsiveness has been observed, but the patient remains relatively hyp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infectious process. Blood cultures have been obtained, but they are pending. The patient was initially responsive to antibiotics, but then developed a fever again overnight. This suggests that the initial treatment may not have been sufficient, and further evaluation for a source of infection is necessary.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal function has worsened, and despite hydration, there is no improvement in creatinine levels, and the urine output remains low. This raises concern for ATN, which can occur due to ischemia or nephrotoxicity. Continued monitoring of BUN/Cr, fluid status, electrolytes, and urine output is important.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to volume depletion. She initially responded to fluid resuscitation but is now relatively hypotensive despite being hemodynamically stable. Given her history of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medications,"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is a 85 year-old female with CHF, afib, HTN, CKD, recent fall,
   presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia,
   and acute renal failure.
   .
   #  Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely infectious.  Fits criteria for
   sepsis with likely source being pulmonary with new effusion and
   infiltrate.  UA negative.  Blood and urine cultures are pending.  She
   initially defervesced after receiving antibiotics and tylenol, however
   spiked a temp again o/n
   - cont levofloxacin for empiric coverage of CAP
   - tylenol prn
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - cx if spikes
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pt with worsening renal failure
   o/n, thought to be pre-renal in the context of infection and decreased
   PO intake.  Also appears to be pre-renal based on urine lytes however
   creatinine is not improving with hydration and UOP remains low.
   Increasing concern for ATN.
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr
   - renally dose medications
   - follow fluid status, electrolytes, UOP
   .
   #  Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to volume depletion in the
   setting of decreased PO intake and insensible losses from
   infection/fevers.  Was fluid responsive, now hemodynamically stable,
   though relatively hypotensive given she carries a history of
   hypertension on multiple anti-hypertensive meds as an outpatient.
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<60 or UOP<30cc/h
   - if hct continues to drop, will give RBC transfusion for volume load
   .
   #  Bilateral pleural effusions:  New compared to CXR from one year
   ago.  Likely secondary to CHF exacerbation.  BNP 2200, baseline not
   known.  EF is unknown, pt is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1140**] (cardiology) as an
   outpatient.  Could have also developed cardiac ischemia secondary to
   demand in the setting of blood loss anemia or as a primary event
   related to his fall.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Likely
   contributing to hypoxia.
   - trend CK, trop x 3
   - holding off on diuresis in setting of infection/intravascular
   depletion
   .
   #  Acute anemia:  Concern for blood loss secondary to fall one week
   ago, possible hematomas at shoulder and right hip.  Hct dropped from
   34.6 one month ago to 26.9 today.  MCV is 91.  Nl platelet count.  No
   history of anemia.  No history of recent observed bleeding.
   - maintain active T+S
   - guaiac all stools
   - q8 hct
   - transfuse < 25, [**Male First Name (un) 194**] with lasix given CHF
   - add-on iron studies, hemolysis labs
   - hold aspirin
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to hypovolemia.  Also on the
   differential would be SIADH, CHF, drug-induced (HCTZ).
   - cont to monitor
   - will repeat Na now s/p volume repletion
   - holding HCTZ
   - consider SIADH work-up if does not improve
   #  s/p Fall:  Sounds consistent with mechanical fall.  No evidence of
   fracture or ICH.  Large echymoses concerning for hematomas as cause for
   anemia.
   - tylenol prn for pain control
   - management of anemia as above
   .
   #  Atrial fibrillation:  Will need to clarify history with outpatient
   cardiologist.  Currently in NSR.
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Holding all anti-hypertensives in the setting of
   recent hypotension.
   .

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the assessment and plan include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. The blood and urine cultures are pending, indicating that there might be a suspicion of sepsis with a likely source being pulmonary due to new effusion and infiltrate.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has worsening renal function, which is thought to be pre-renal in the context of infection and decreased oral intake. However, the creatinine is not improving with hydration and the urine output remains low, raising concerns for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of decreased oral intake and insensible losses from infection/fevers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a recent fall. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU due to her critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which could be due to volume depletion from decreased oral intake and insensible losses from infection and fevers. The hypotension may also be secondary to the patient's large ecchymoses, which could have contributed to her critical drop in hemoglobin.

2. RLL PNEUMONIA WITH PARAPNEUMONIC EFFUSIONS: The patient has a likely right lower lobe pneumonia with associated pleural effusions. This is indicated by her symptoms of cough, hypoxia, and leukocytosis. It is a potential cause of her fever and should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

3. SIRS (SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SYNDROME): The patient's presentation of fever, elevated WBC count, and hypotension suggest the possibility of SIRS, which is a serious condition that can progress to sepsis.

4. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's worsening renal function may be pre-"

- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall.
- She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions, which is the likely cause of her symptoms, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.
- There is a concern for sepsis-induced respiratory syndrome (SIRS) due to the presence of fever, elevated WBC count, and hypotension.
- The patient's elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) suggests a component of heart failure, worsened by anemia and contributing to the pleural effusions.
- Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also considered in the differential diagnosis, but the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation or computed tomography angiography (CTA) at this time.
- A ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan would not be sensitive in the setting of lung pathology.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall. The patient presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions: The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest a possible infection, which may lead to worsening of the pneumonia and associated complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function indicates the need for close monitoring of kidney function and electrolyte levels. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to inadequate urine output and persistent creatinine levels despite fluid resuscitation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and current hypotension could indicate volume depletion or a cardiac issue. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid status is necessary.

4. Acute anemia: The patient's significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit suggests acute blood loss, possibly due to the fall one week ago. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions, which is likely causing her leukocytosis and fever. There is also concern for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to her fever, elevated white blood cell count, and hypotension. The patient has an elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), suggesting a component of heart failure that may be worsened by anemia and contributing to the pleural effusions. Pulmonary embolism (PE) has been considered, but the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation or computed tomography angiography (CTA) at this time. A ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan would not be sensitive in the setting of lung pathology.

The patient's renal function has worsened, and there is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her blood pressure has been relatively low, possibly secondary to volume depletion and decreased oral intake. The patient has large ecchymoses, which may have contributed to her critical drop in hemoglobin level. She has also been experiencing acute an"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 year-old female with CHF, afib, HTN, s/p nephrectomy of
   left kidney for renal cell carcinoma, CKD, recent fall, presents with
   malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute
   on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #  RLL pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions: Most likely etiology
   of pt
s leukocytosis and fever.  Concern for SIRS with fever, elevated
   WBC, hypotension.  Urine legionella antigen was positive, so likely
   cause of pneumonia. In addition, Streptococcus might also be a
   possibility, but unlikely. CXR showed pleural effusion on the left with
   a consolidation in the left lower lobe. CT scan showed bilateral
   pleural effusions and left-sided consolidation in lower lobePatient
   continues to have a fever, despite treatment with levofloxacin. Since
   the patient has an elevated BNP, the etiology of his effusions might
   also be cardiac.
   - Renal dose adjustment of Levofloxacin to treat legionella (started
   [**2154-6-8**])
   - Start Vancomycin to cover possible staph (started [**2154-6-10**])
   - obtain sputum culture
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - U/S of the lung to assess whether or not the pleural effusion can be
   tapped
   - tylenol prn
   - cx if spikes
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - f/u echo for cardiac function that might related to pleural
   effusions, f/u outpt cardiologist
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pt with worsening renal failure
   o/n, thought to be pre-renal in the context of infection and decreased
   PO intake.  Also appears to be pre-renal based on urine lytes
   (FeNa=0.8%) however creatinine is not improving with hydration and UOP
   remains low.   Increasing concern for ATN. Patient also has an anion
   gap (=14) acidosis.
   - start D5W with 3 Amps of bicarb for pt
s acidosis
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr.
   - renally dose medications
   - follow fluid status, electrolytes, UOP. Will check PM lytes.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:  Likely related to Legionella infection. Also might be
   intravascularly depleted and has ADH response.  Also on the
   differential would be SIADH, CHF, drug-induced (HCTZ).
   - cont to monitor
   - holding HCTZ
   .
   #  Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to volume depletion in the
   setting of decreased PO intake and insensible losses from
   infection/fevers.  Pt also has large ecchymoses which may have
   contributed to her crit drop.  Was fluid responsive, now
   hemodynamically stable, though relatively hypotensive given she carries
   a history of hypertension on multiple anti-hypertensive meds as an
   outpatient.
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<60 or UOP<30cc/h
   .
   #  Acute anemia:  Concern for blood loss secondary to fall one week
   ago, possible hematomas at shoulder and right hip.  Hct dropped from
   34.6 one month ago to 26.9 yesterday and 27.9 today.  MCV is 92.  Nl
   platelet count.  No history of anemia.  No history of recent observed
   bleeding.  Negative hemolysis w/u, iron studies suggest anemia of
   chronic disease.  Crit has been stable.
   - maintain active T+S
   - guaiac stools have been negative
   - q8 hct
   - transfuse < 25, [**Male First Name (un) 194**] with lasix given CHF if pt becomes volume
   overloaded
   - hold aspirin, SC heparin
   .
   #  s/p Fall:  Sounds consistent with mechanical fall.  No evidence of
   fracture or ICH.  Large echymoses concerning for hematomas as cause for
   anemia.
   - tylenol prn for pain control
   - management of anemia as above

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic anemia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's urine sediment suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and their sputum culture was positive for Legionella. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics and IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they have a low oxygen saturation during sleep, for which supplemental oxygen is being provided. The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities in electrolyte levels and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The presence of acute renal failure and ATN suggests a risk of developing AKI. Continued monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia Complications: Given the positive Legionella antigen test, there is a possibility of developing complications associated with pneumonia, such as sepsis or respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued antibiotic therapy are crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may increase the risk of organ perfusion and ischemia. Maintaining adequate blood pressure through appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The abnormal electrolyte levels indicate the need for careful monitoring and management to prevent electrolyte imbalances that could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent fall. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions, hypotension, chronic anemia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions: The patient's symptoms of malaise, cough, hypoxia, and chest CT findings suggest pneumonia. The presence of effusions indicates a possible complication called parapneumonic effusion.
2. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may indicate acute-on-chronic renal failure, which is a worsening of pre-existing kidney disease.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to volume depletion from decreased oral intake and insensible losses from infection/fevers.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia. The cause may be related to blood loss from a fall, hematomas, or chronic disease.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, new bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest a possible right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. She also has hyponatremia, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's anemia may be due to blood loss from a recent fall or hematomas. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but with relative hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and leukocytosis, along with the presence of right lower lobe consolidation on chest CT, suggest pneumonia. The antibiotic levofloxacin has been continued for empiric coverage of community-acquired pneumonia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's worsening renal function and elevated BUN/Cr levels indicate acute kidney injury. Renal consult has been obtained, and the patient is receiving D5 with 3 amps bicarb and ical and albumin for renal support.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to volume depletion from decreased oral intake and insensible losses from infection/fevers. She was initially fluid-responsive but now remains"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an elderly deaf female with several medical conditions. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for pneumonia, chronic anemia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), blood pressure ranging from 149/62 mmHg to 121/45 mmHg, heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including a trans-thoracic echo, ultrasound, renal consult, sputum culture, and chest CT scan. The chest CT scan shows extensive right lower lobe consolidation and opacity, indicating pneumonia. The trans-thoracic echo reveals mild dilation of the left atrium, mildly thickened aortic and mitral valve leaflets with trace aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation, respectively. There are no signs of significant cardiac abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. However, there are decreased levels of albumin and magnesium. Electrolyte imbalances are present with increased levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride, while calcium and phosphate levels are within normal range. The kidney function tests suggest acute renal failure.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly deaf female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 149/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's renal consult indicates likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) based on urine sediment analysis. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids and bicarbonate. An ultrasound of the lungs revealed a small area of fluid but not enough to tap. The sputum culture was non-diagnostic, and the urine Legionella antigen test came back positive. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Levofloxacin on 06/10/2154 at 11:42 AM, 12:19 PM, and 12:31 PM, respectively. The patient is currently receiving Famotidine (Pepcid) and other ICU medications.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance with a total intake of 2,360 mL and total output of 1,215 mL. The patient's blood products include a total out of 1,215 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the ABG results are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Her HEENT exam shows sclera that are anicteric, with no murmurs or abnormal lung sounds. The CV exam shows regular heart rhythm and normal S1 + S2 without murmurs or rubs. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. The extremities show warm and well-perfused skin, along with 1+ lower extremity edema and 2+ pulses.

Laboratory results include elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly elevated lactate levels. The cardiac enzymes are within normal range. The chest CT shows extensive right lower lobe consolidation and opacity, strongly suggesting pneumonia, as well as a moderate reactive pleural effusion. The trans-thoracic echo indicates mild left atrial dilation, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation.

The lower extremity ultrasound reveals no evidence of deep venous thrombosis but does show a cystic lesion in the right groin, likely representing a lymphocele. The patient's assessment includes chronic anemia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The plan involves ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   This is a 85 year-old female with CHF, afib, HTN, s/p nephrectomy of
   left kidney for renal cell carcinoma, CKD, recent fall, presents with
   malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute
   on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #  RLL pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions: Most likely etiology
   of pt
s leukocytosis and fever.  Concern for SIRS with fever, elevated
   WBC, hypotension.  Urine legionella antigen was positive, so likely
   cause of pneumonia. In addition, Streptococcus might also be a
   possibility, but unlikely. CXR showed pleural effusion on the left with
   a consolidation in the left lower lobe. CT scan showed bilateral
   pleural effusions and left-sided consolidation in lower lobePatient
   continues to have a fever, despite treatment with levofloxacin. Since
   the patient has an elevated BNP, the etiology of his effusions might
   also be cardiac.
   - Renal dose adjustment of Levofloxacin to treat legionella (started
   [**2154-6-8**])
   - Start Vancomycin to cover possible staph (started [**2154-6-10**])
   - obtain sputum culture
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - U/S of the lung to assess whether or not the pleural effusion can be
   tapped
   - tylenol prn
   - cx if spikes
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - f/u echo for cardiac function that might related to pleural
   effusions, f/u outpt cardiologist
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pt with worsening renal failure
   o/n, thought to be pre-renal in the context of infection and decreased
   PO intake.  Also appears to be pre-renal based on urine lytes
   (FeNa=0.8%) however creatinine is not improving with hydration and UOP
   remains low.   Increasing concern for ATN. Patient also has an anion
   gap (=14) acidosis.
   - start D5W with 3 Amps of bicarb for pt
s acidosis
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr.
   - renally dose medications
   - follow fluid status, electrolytes, UOP. Will check PM lytes.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:  Likely related to Legionella infection. Also might be
   intravascularly depleted and has ADH response.  Also on the
   differential would be SIADH, CHF, drug-induced (HCTZ).
   - cont to monitor
   - holding HCTZ
   .
   #  Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to volume depletion in the
   setting of decreased PO intake and insensible losses from
   infection/fevers.  Pt also has large ecchymoses which may have
   contributed to her crit drop.  Was fluid responsive, now
   hemodynamically stable, though relatively hypotensive given she carries
   a history of hypertension on multiple anti-hypertensive meds as an
   outpatient.
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<60 or UOP<30cc/h
   .
   #  Acute anemia:  Concern for blood loss secondary to fall one week
   ago, possible hematomas at shoulder and right hip.  Hct dropped from
   34.6 one month ago to 26.9 yesterday and 27.9 today.  MCV is 92.  Nl
   platelet count.  No history of anemia.  No history of recent observed
   bleeding.  Negative hemolysis w/u, iron studies suggest anemia of
   chronic disease.  Crit has been stable.
   - maintain active T+S
   - guaiac stools have been negative
   - q8 hct
   - transfuse < 25, [**Male First Name (un) 194**] with lasix given CHF if pt becomes volume
   overloaded
   - hold aspirin, SC heparin
   .
   #  s/p Fall:  Sounds consistent with mechanical fall.  No evidence of
   fracture or ICH.  Large echymoses concerning for hematomas as cause for
   anemia.
   - tylenol prn for pain control
   - management of anemia as above
   .
   #  Atrial fibrillation:  Will need to clarify history with outpatient
   cardiologist.  Currently in NSR.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and renal cell carcinoma. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient's main medical issues include pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions, acute-on-chronic renal failure, anemia, hypotension, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms such as cough and hypoxia, along with imaging findings showing consolidation and pleural effusion, suggesting pneumonia. The positive urine Legionella antigen suggests that Legionella bacteria might be the cause.
2. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, which is pre-renal in nature due to infection and decreased oral intake. The urine sodium (FeNa) is low, but creatinine is not improving with hydration, indicating the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and there is evidence of blood loss from a fall one week ago, as well as possible hematomas at the shoulder and hip. The anemia could be due to acute blood loss or chronic disease.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which could be related to Legionella infection or other causes such as"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 149/62 to 155/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Renal consult reveals likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) based on urine sediment analysis. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids and has had a renal ultrasound which showed a small area of fluid, but not enough to warrant aspiration.

Sputum culture was non-diagnostic and no further cultures were pursued. Urine Legionella antigen was positive. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of shortness of breath.

Flow sheet data indicates ongoing fluid administration and blood product transfusions. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable blood pressure and heart rate, but decreased oxygen saturation while sleeping.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's intubation and sedation. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated"

   This is a 85 year-old female with CHF, afib, HTN, s/p nephrectomy of
   left kidney for renal cell carcinoma, CKD, recent fall, presents with
   malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute
   on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #  RLL pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions: Most likely etiology
   of pt
s leukocytosis and fever.  Concern for SIRS with fever, elevated
   WBC, hypotension.  Urine legionella antigen was positive, so likely
   cause of pneumonia. In addition, Streptococcus might also be a
   possibility, but unlikely. CXR showed pleural effusion on the left with
   a consolidation in the left lower lobe. CT scan showed bilateral
   pleural effusions and left-sided consolidation in lower lobePatient
   continues to have a fever, despite treatment with levofloxacin. Since
   the patient has an elevated BNP, the etiology of his effusions might
   also be cardiac.
   - Renal dose adjustment of Levofloxacin to treat legionella (started
   [**2154-6-8**])
   - Start Vancomycin to cover possible staph (started [**2154-6-10**])
   - obtain sputum culture

   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - f/u echo for cardiac function that might related to pleural
   effusions, f/u outpt cardiologist

   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pt with worsening renal failure
   o/n, thought to be pre-renal in the context of infection and decreased
   PO intake.  Also appears to be pre-renal based on urine lytes
   (FeNa=0.8%) however creatinine is not improving with hydration and UOP
   remains low.   Increasing concern for ATN. Patient also has an anion
   gap (=14) acidosis.
   - start D5W with 3 Amps of bicarb for pt
s acidosis
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr.
   - renally dose medications
   - follow fluid status, electrolytes, UOP. Will check PM lytes.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:  Likely related to Legionella infection. Also might be
   intravascularly depleted and has ADH response.  Also on the
   differential would be SIADH, CHF, drug-induced (HCTZ).
   - cont to monitor
   - holding HCTZ
   .
   #  Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to volume depletion in the
   setting of decreased PO intake and insensible losses from
   infection/fevers.  Pt also has large ecchymoses which may have
   contributed to her crit drop.  Was fluid responsive, now
   hemodynamically stable, though relatively hypotensive given she carries
   a history of hypertension on multiple anti-hypertensive meds as an
   outpatient.
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<60 or UOP<30cc/h
   .
   #  Acute anemia:  Concern for blood loss secondary to fall one week
   ago, possible hematomas at shoulder and right hip.  Hct dropped from
   34.6 one month ago to 26.9 yesterday and 27.9 today.  MCV is 92.  Nl
   platelet count.  No history of anemia.  No history of recent observed
   bleeding.  Negative hemolysis w/u, iron studies suggest anemia of
   chronic disease.  Crit has been stable.
   - maintain active T+S
   - guaiac stools have been negative
   - q8 hct
   - transfuse < 25, [**Male First Name (un) 194**] with lasix given CHF if pt becomes volume
   overloaded
   - hold aspirin, SC heparin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), and a history of nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. The patient presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a positive urine Legionella antigen and extensive right lower lobe consolidation on chest CT, strongly suggesting pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, and sepsis.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is worsening despite hydration, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated BUN/Cr ratio further support the diagnosis of ARF. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased urine output.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has a low serum sodium level, which can be related to Legionella infection, intravascular volume depletion, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary to prevent complications related to sodium imbalance.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low considering her history of"

   #  RLL pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions: Most likely etiology
   of pt
s leukocytosis and fever.  Concern for SIRS with fever, elevated
   WBC, hypotension.  Urine legionella antigen was positive, so likely
   cause of pneumonia. CXR showed pleural effusion on the R with a
   consolidation in the R lower lobe. CT scan showed bilateral pleural
   effusions and R-sided consolidation in lower lobe. Sputum Cx canceled
   by lab because of contamination w/ upper resp. secretions. Patient has
   been afebrile since [**6-10**] at 1600, temp was 100.5.  Lung U/S done on
   [**6-10**] showed too little fluid to tap. Since the patient has an elevated
   BNP, the etiology of his effusions might also be cardiac.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), and a previous nephrectomy of the left kidney for renal cell carcinoma. She presents with malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically Legionella pneumonia, as indicated by a positive urine Legionella antigen test. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT scan, have shown extensive right lower lobe consolidation and opacity, along with bilateral pleural effusions. The etiology of her effusions might also be cardiac, as suggested by an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.

The patient's renal function is worsening, and she has acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Her urine sediment results suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Despite hydration, her serum creatinine is not improving, and her urine output is low.

The patient is also experiencing hyponatremia, which may be related to the Legionella infection or other causes such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), CHF, or drug-induced. Her sodium levels will need to be closely monitored.

Additionally, the patient has hypotension, likely secondary to volume depletion and decreased oral intake. Her blood pressure has been"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. She presented with malaise, cough, hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia, most likely caused by Legionella bacteria, as indicated by a positive urine antigen test. The pneumonia may have also contributed to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). She has developed acute kidney injury (ATN) due to dehydration and decreased urine output. The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to volume depletion and infection-related insensible losses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has extensive right lower lobe consolidation and opacity on chest CT, suggesting pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and further deterioration of renal function.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's worsening renal function, indicated by rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output, suggests ATN. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity of medications, and potential need for dialysis.
3. Legionella Infection: The positive urine antigen test for Legionella indicates a specific bacterial infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, should be continued to prevent complications associated with Legionella pneumonia.
4. Hypotension:"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU. The note indicates several ongoing medical issues and interventions. 

The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided note. However, the note mentions that renal consult was requested due to urine sediment showing likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient continues to receive D5 with 3 amps bicarb (low bicarb still) and has been ordered to have ical and albumin.

An ultrasound of the lung showed a small area of fluid but not enough to tap. Sputum culture was non-diagnostic, and another culture was not pursued. However, the urine Legionella antigen test came back positive.

The patient is on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC) overnight because their oxygen saturation levels were lowering to around 93% while sleeping. During wakefulness, no oxygen requirement is needed.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin at 11:42 AM, Ceftriaxone at 12:19 PM, and Levofloxacin at 12:31 PM.

Infusions include Famotidine (Pepcid) at 08:53 AM. Other medications are also being administered.

There are no changes mentioned in the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The flow sheet data as of 06:39 AM on [date] includes vital"
