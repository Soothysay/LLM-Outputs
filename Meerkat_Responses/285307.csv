","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He has been on immunosuppression and has had multiple hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans, resistant pseudomonal infections, and recent intubation. The patient presents with respiratory distress and hypoxia.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to pneumonia (PNA). The presence of gurgling and coarse breath sounds suggests bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis obliterans related to his graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The possibility of H1N1 influenza is also considered. The patient is currently stable on a face tent delivering 100% oxygen, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

2. CML s/p BMT and Chronic GVHD: The patient's history of CML and BMT, along with chronic GVHD, needs to be managed with appropriate immunosuppressive therapy. Consideration should be given to stress dose steroids, checking liver function tests (LFTs), continuing cellcept, and prophylaxis with bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole.

3. Troponin Leak: The patient has a history of elevated troponin levels. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Acute on chronic respiratory failure:  Multifactorial given history
   of GVHD, bronchiectasis, PEs, recurrent pneumonias with resistant
   organisms.  Cough now productive of purulent yellow sputum.  Currently
   on vanco/cefipime/levo,  tamaflu prophylaxis.  DFA pending.  Chest PT,
   suctioning.  Broaden antibiotics guided by review of sensitivities to
   prior infectious etiology. ID to consult.
   2.  CML:  Chronically on prednisone, unable to take pos, will give
   solumedrol IV.  Continue celcept.  Holding prophylactiv bactrim today
   given he is NPO pending speech and swallow exam.
   3.  CAD:  ECG with poor baseline given patient movement.  Troponin 0.12
   albeit chronically elevated.  Doubt ACS, cycle enzymes, repeat ECG.
   4.  DVT:  Continue lovenox.
   5.  Anemia:  Serial CBCs, GAS, PPI while NPO.
   Agree with assessment and plan as per medical ICU housestaff note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) and is experiencing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with respiratory failure, poor secretion clearance, and bronchiectasis, leading to recurrent pneumonias with resistant organisms. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics and antiviral prophylaxis. He has been admitted to the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's history of GVHD, bronchiectasis, pulmonary embolisms, and recurrent pneumonias with resistant organisms contribute to his current respiratory failure. The coughing up of purulent yellow sputum suggests an ongoing infection. Broadening antibiotics guided by sensitivities is recommended, along with chest physiotherapy and suctioning. An infectious disease specialist should be consulted.

2. CML: The patient is chronically on prednisone, which he is unable to take orally. Instead, he will receive solumedrol IV. Continuing with celcept and holding prophylactic bactrim until a speech and swallow exam is done is advised.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's ECG shows poor baseline due to patient movement, and his troponin levels are chronically elevated. While acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is doubtful, repeating the ECG"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is acute on chronic respiratory failure, with a history of pneumonia and bronchiectasis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/64 to 118/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95%, and a sinus rhythm on EKG.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics for their condition, including Linezolid, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Voriconazole, Acyclovir, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Tobramycin. They are also receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue, cough, dyspnea, anemia, and no pain. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving nutritional support as tolerated.

The flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,675 mL of fluid intake since 12 AM, with 400 mL given orally and 2,275 mL administered intravenously. The patient has had a total output of 2,560 mL, including 1,407 mL of urine output.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 133 K/uL, platelet count of 217 mg/dL, sodium level of 29 mEq/L, potassium level of 0.6 mg/dL, and chloride level of 5.0 mEq/L. The patient's glucose level is 115 mg/dL, and their troponin-T level is 0.12 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, respiratory failure (acute on chronic), anemia, hypokalemia, and CML (chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression). The patient's respiratory status is improving, with better cough and comfort. Antibiotics have been changed as recommended by the ID consult. The patient will continue nebs and remain in the ICU for further monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to antibiotic resistance, electrolyte imbalances, and potential bleeding or clotting disorders."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  Bronchiectasis, pnuemonia.
   Continues on broad spectrum antibiotics.  No new micro data.  Needs
   chest PT, sucitoning.  Continue to monitor in the ICU. More diminished

   tolerated.

 MYOCLONUS:  Concerned for early serotonin syndrome on fentanyl and
   linezolid.  Will discuss possibly discontinuing the latter with the ID
   consultants.
 HYPONATREMIA:  Many of his meds are in D5W. Will try to restrict free
   water intake by changing meds to NS.  Serial electrolytes.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and medications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Prolonged or worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as acute on chronic, indicating that they have pre-existing respiratory problems that are now worsening. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially require more aggressive interventions such as mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected pneumonia. However, there is no mention of new microbiological data, indicating that the current antibiotic regimen may not be effectively treating the infection. This could result in the progression or development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

3. Myoclonus: The patient is experiencing increased myoclonus, which is characterized by sudden involuntary muscle contractions. This symptom is concerning for the possibility of early serotonin syndrome, especially considering the combination of fentanyl and linezolid being used. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and management.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which could be due to several factors including medications administered in D5W (5% dextrose in water), excessive free water intake, or other underlying conditions. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's electrolytes carefully to prevent complications related to sodium imbalance.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for prophylaxis against DVT. However, an ultrasound was performed and ruled out DVT. It is important to continue monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT and ensure proper anticoagulation therapy is provided.

6. Pain management: The patient has secondary pain due to disc compressions. Adequate pain control is crucial to improve the patient's comfort and overall well-being. The current pain management regimen seems to be adequately controlling the patient's pain.

7. Potential need for restraints: There is a mention of reviewing the need for restraints. Restraints can have psychological and physical implications for the patient, so it is important to carefully evaluate the necessity and duration of their use.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple potential complications. The healthcare team should regularly assess the patient's respiratory status, infection control, electrolyte balance, and other vital parameters to ensure appropriate interventions are taken promptly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in 2121. He is currently on chronic immunosuppression and has been hospitalized multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans, resistant pseudomonal infections, and recent intubation. The patient presents with respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an opacity in the right lung base on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia. The influenza H1N1 test is negative, and sputum is growing E. coli. The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with poor airflow at the right base. Weaning off oxygen, chest physiotherapy, and continuing Zosyn (an antibiotic) are recommended. Follow-up pending cultures and antibiotic sensitivities is advised.

2. CML s/p BMT and Chronic GVHD: The patient has a history of CML after BMT and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The plan includes changing methylprednisolone to prednisone, continuing cellcept, and maintaining prophylaxis with bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole.

3. Troponin Leak: The patient has chronically elevated troponins, but cardiac enzymes are negative/stable. An EKG shows no obvious ischemic changes. It is unlikely"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) who has been on chronic immunosuppression. He has been hospitalized multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans, resistant pseudomonal infections, and recent intubation.

The patient presents with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The assessment indicates that he has an ESBL E. coli pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of the bacteria in his sputum and opacity in the right lung base on the chest X-ray. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with very poor airflow at the right base.

The plan includes weaning off oxygen as tolerated, performing chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions, continuing with Zosyn (an antibiotic), using albuterol/ipratropium nebs, administering monthly IVIG, following up with infectious disease recommendations, and discussing the possibility of tracheostomy versus noninvasive ventilation (NIPPV) with a pulmonologist.

Additionally, the patient has a history of CML s/p BMT and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The plan includes changing methylprednisolone to oral prednisone, continuing with cellcept, and providing prophylaxis with Bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole.

The note also mentions that the patient has"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY:  Skin care per nursing.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  Bronchiectasis, recurrent E.
   Coli infection now on zosyn.  Have stopped linexolid, cefipime, tobra,
   and switched to proplylactic bactrim.  Appears to be more fatigued
   today.  Will remain in ICU given tenuous respiratory status.  Will
   discuss benefits for trach to facilitate pulmonary toilet going
   forward, will discuss with oncology.
 HYPONATREMIA:  Euvolemic.  Was getting many meds in D5 which have
   been stopped or changed to NS.  Also may have component of SIADH
   secondary to pulmonary process andor pain.  Free water restriction and

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is experiencing acute on chronic respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of bronchiectasis and recurrent E. Coli infection, currently being treated with Zosyn.
- The patient's pain is being managed, and there are no complaints of pain.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity, and skin care is being provided by nursing staff.
- The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and they may require a tracheostomy for better pulmonary toilet.
- The patient has hypotension, which is believed to be euvolemic and potentially due to medications or SIADH secondary to the pulmonary process and/or pain. Free water restriction and monitoring of electrolytes are recommended.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure indicates a high risk for worsening respiratory function, which can lead to further respiratory failure or the need for more invasive respiratory support such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's history of recurrent E. Coli infections suggests an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly in the respiratory tract. This could lead to the development of new infections or the worsening of existing ones.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylaxis measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.
4. Stress ulcer"

He is on chronic immunosuppression and has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans. He was found to have extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. Coli in his sputum.

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to ESBL E. Coli pneumonia. He has infiltrates in the right lung base and right upper lobe on X-Ray. He tested negative for influenza H1N1 and is saturating in the low 90s on high-flow nasal cannula with very poor airflow at the right base.

The plan includes weaning off oxygen as tolerated, chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions, continuing Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and continuing albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers. The patient is also on a monthly IVIG regimen and will be followed up with infectious disease recommendations.

The patient's other medical conditions include a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), multiple vertebral fractures, and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as a result of his BMT. He is currently on prednisone, cellcept, and prophylactic medications including bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole.

The patient continues to receive home dose lovenox for his history of PE and DVT. He is also being managed for pain control related to his multiple vertebral fractures using fentanyl patches, methadone, lidocaine patches, and morphine IV for breakthrough pain.

The patient's current ICU care includes regular diet and oral home medications, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently on chronic immunosuppression and has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient was found to have extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. Coli in his sputum.

The patient's current condition includes:
- ESBL E. COLI PNEUMONIA: The patient has right lung base and right upper lobe infiltrate on X-Ray. Influenza H1N1 is negative, and he is intubated with a high-flow neb, experiencing very poor air flow at the right base.
- HYONATREMIA: The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH), along with his lung process.
- CML s/p BMT and Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD): The patient is on chronic immunosuppression and requires prophylaxis against infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.
- HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE) AND DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (DVT): The patient has had multiple PEs in [**2122**] and a DVT in early [**2123**].
- MULTIPLE VERTEBRAL FRACTURES: The patient requires pain management and avoidance of excessive opioids.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/70 mmHg to 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 98%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count ranging from 3.2 to 6.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level ranging from 7.6 to 9.0 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 133 to 167 K/uL. Other lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid, as well as low levels of calcium and magnesium.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progression of hyponatremia, and potential infections due to immunosuppression. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for further thromboembolic events given his history of PE and DVT.

Based on the patient's condition and the potential complications, it is important to closely monitor his respiratory status, electrolyte levels, and renal function. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and efforts should be made to wean off the ventil"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) status post Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. ESBL E. Coli Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) E. Coli. The infection is present in his right lung base and right upper lobe, as shown on the X-Ray. Influenza H1N1 has been ruled out. The patient is on high-flow neb with very poor air flow at the right base.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely due to Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) secretion associated with his lung process. It is important to monitor the patient's fluid balance and trend sodium levels.

3. Chronic GVHD: The patient has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as a result of his BMT. He is on prednisone, cellcept, and other prophylactic medications.

4. History of PE, DVT: The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in [**2122**] and early [**2123**]. He is currently receiving home"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute on chronic respiratory failure. They are currently on droplet precautions due to potential H1N1 exposure. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including Bactrim, Vancomycin, Acyclovir, Voriconazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. They are also receiving infusions of Enoxaparin and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/79 mmHg to 144/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 936 mL and output of 1,910 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of -974 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of high flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and an ABG result of ///37/.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight/obese, with PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, and warm skin with multiple excoriations. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema at 1+.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 3.6 to 5"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**], chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans, and an infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. Coli in his sputum. 

The patient is currently in the ICU due to several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. ESBL E. Coli Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection with ESBL E. Coli, which has led to pneumonia with right lung base and upper lobe infiltrate on X-Ray. This infection needs to be treated appropriately with antibiotics.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient is experiencing hyponatremia, which is a low sodium level in the blood. This is likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) associated with the lung process. Close monitoring of fluid balance and sodium levels is required.

3. Chronic GVHD: The patient has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as a result of the BMT. This condition requires ongoing immunosuppression with medications such as prednisone, cellcept, and bactrim.

4. History of PE/DVT: The patient has a history of pulmonary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently on chronic immunosuppression and has been hospitalized multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient was recently found to have extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. Coli pneumonia, with right lung base and right upper lobe infiltrate on X-ray. His current condition includes:

1. ESBL E. COLI PNEUMONIA: The patient has a confirmed infection of ESBL E. Coli in his sputum, leading to pneumonia. He is currently receiving treatment with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

2. HYONATREMIA: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely related to his lung process and possible syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Fluid balance and sodium levels should be closely monitored.

3. CML S/P BMT AND CHRONIC GVHD: The patient has a history of CML and underwent BMT. He also has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He is currently on prednisone, cellcept, and prophylactic antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

4. HX OF PE, DVT: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently on enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis.

5. MULTIPLE VERTEBRAL FRACTURES: The patient has multiple vertebral fractures and is being managed with a back brace, pain control medications, and avoidance of excessive opioids.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the ESBL E. Coli pneumonia, progression of hyponatremia, development of further GVHD symptoms, recurrence of PE/DVT, and exacerbation of multiple vertebral fractures. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential for these conditions."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently on chronic immunosuppression and has been hospitalized multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans. He was found to have extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia, with right lung base and right upper lobe infiltrate on X-Ray. Influenza H1N1 DFA was negative.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving 50% face mask oxygen. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 103 bpm (with a normal range of 94-109 bpm), blood pressure of 118/65 mmHg (with a normal range of 96-137/65-101 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 11-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nebulizer.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.6-5.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.1-8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 133-238 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4-0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 74-118 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated levels of lactate acid, lactic acid, and leukocyte count.

The patient's physical examination reveals general ill appearance, use of accessory muscles with paradoxical breathing, diffusely rhonchorous breath sounds with expiratory wheezing bilaterally, tender lower abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Myoclonic jerks were also observed in the upper extremities during the exam.

The patient's assessment includes ESBL E. coli pneumonia, chronic immunosuppression post BMT, bronchiolitis obliterans, and a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis. He has hyponatremia resolving consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion due to lung process.

The patient's plan includes weaning off oxygen as tolerated, chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions, continuation of Zosyn (on day 8 of 8), monthly IVIG, follow-up with infectious disease recommendations, discussion regarding tracheostomy placement, and continuation of prophylactic Tamiflu and respiratory precautions due to exposure for 7 days. The patient is also advised to be out of bed as tolerated and to have Foley catheter removed.

The patient's other medical conditions include CML post BMT and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), for which he is to continue with oral pred"

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN);  Appreciate pain consult
   input to try to optimize pain management given it is a balance between
   pain management and not suppressing his respiratory drive.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY:  Skin care per nursing.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  GVHD, bronchiectasis,
   recurrent pneumonia growing E. Coli.  Continues zosyn.  Steroid taper
   as per BMT service following along.  Secretions seemed to be minimal at
   this point, requiring less frequent suctioning.  Out of bed to chair as
   tolerated.  Continue nebs.  Continues on droplet precautions and
   tamiflu x 7 days for influenza exposure here in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute on chronic respiratory failure. They have a history of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiectasis, and recurrent pneumonia caused by E. coli. The patient is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics (zosyn), a steroid taper, and nebulizers. They are also on droplet precautions and taking tamiflu for influenza exposure. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 109/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems indicates fatigue, pain, and edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while other values are within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, right lower extremity edema, and warm skin with multiple excoriations. Pain management, skin integrity, and respiratory failure are the main concerns in the patient's assessment and plan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent pneumonia and current respiratory symptoms put them at risk for developing another episode of pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of edema in both lower extremities raises concern for the possibility of developing DVT.

He has been hospitalized multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans and was found to have ESBL E. Coli in his sputum.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several conditions:

1. ESBL E. Coli Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed infection of ESBL E. Coli causing pneumonia, with right lung base and right upper lobe infiltrate on X-Ray. He is currently on day 8 of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) therapy and will continue with albuterol/ipratropium nebs, monthly IVIG, and follow-up Infectious Disease recommendations. The discussion regarding tracheostomy placement is ongoing.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has difficulty breathing and is currently on high flow neb with oxygen delivery.
- Foley catheter had to be reinserted as the patient was unable to void on his own.
- There is bleeding from an eschar on the patient's back, resulting in a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) by 2 points to 23.5.
- The patient is on a steroid taper per BMT recommendations.
- The patient's allergies are negative.
- The last doses of antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Acyclovir, and Voriconazole) were administered on 10/5, 10/6, and 10/6 respectively.
- The patient is receiving various infusions including Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Enoxaparin (Lovenox).
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/81 to 141/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.
- The patient's weight is currently 70.9 kg.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,096 mL and output of 1,900 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 196 mL.
- The patient requires respiratory support and is using accessory muscles with paradoxical breathing.
- The patient's physical examination reveals diffusely rhonchorous breath sounds with expiratory wheezing bilaterally, tender lower abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema.
- The patient exhibits myoclonic jerks in his upper extremities during the exam.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (228 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (7.8 g/dL), elevated creatinine (0.7), elevated glucose levels, and other abnormalities.
- The patient has a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT) in 2021, chronic immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans, and an ESBL E. coli infection in his sputum.
- The patient has pneumonia with right lung base and right upper lobe infiltrate on X-ray. Influenza H1N1 DFA negative.
- The patient is currently on 50% face mask and easily desaturates when positioning the mask or moving.
- The patient is weaning off oxygen as tolerated, receiving chest physiotherapy, and has completed an 8-day course of Zosyn.
- The patient is also on albuterol/ipratropium nebs, monthly IVIG, and is being followed up with ID recommendations.
- There is a discussion regarding the possibility of tracheostomy placement, whether it should be done surgically or through percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT).
- The patient is on prophylactic Tamiflu and respiratory precautions due to exposure.
- The patient is out of bed as tolerated and the Foley catheter needs to be removed.
- The patient's hypontatremia is resolving and is consistent with SIADH along with lung process.
- The patient's chronic GVHD and CML s/p BMT require ongoing management with prednisone taper, cellcept, bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole prophylaxis.
- The patient's history of PE and DVT necessitates continuing home dose lovenox.
- The patient has multiple vertebral fractures and pain management is required.
- The patient's ICU care includes regular diet and PO home meds, repletion of electrolytes as needed, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, infection due to immunosuppression, bleeding from the eschar, and complications related to the patient's chronic GVHD and CML s/p BMT."

","Summary:
The patient is a post allo-SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplant) recipient with ongoing GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). They have been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to secretions in the setting of pneumonia and bronchial obliterans. The patient continues to desaturate and requires continuous suctioning, nebulizers (nebs), and prednisone. Immunosuppression is being continued with a slow prednisone taper. The patient also requires pain control using fentanyl, lidocaine, and morphine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia and bronchial obliterans.
2. Sepsis secondary to infection, especially considering the immunocompromised state of the patient.
3. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
4. Renal impairment indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hepatic dysfunction suggested by deranged liver function tests (ALT/AST).
6. Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia).
7. Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy.
8. Infection-related complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcers.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient experienced desaturation events, indicating difficulty maintaining oxygen saturation levels. The patient also continues to have respiratory distress due to secretions and underlying conditions such as pneumonia and bronchial obliterans. The patient underwent allo-SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation) and is experiencing ongoing immunosuppression, which may contribute to the risk of developing GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). The patient's pain management plan includes both acute and chronic pain control strategies.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and desaturation events indicate a high risk of respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to allo-SCT and ongoing GVHD increases the risk of infections, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly identified and treated.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a potential risk for blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, suggesting a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress-induced ulcers.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a post-myeloid stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with ongoing immunosuppression and GVHD. They have a history of pneumonia (pna) and bronchial obliterans. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress, desaturation, and weakness. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with high flow nebulizer therapy (nebs) and receiving prednisone for immunosuppression. The patient also has acute and chronic pain, for which they are receiving fentanyl, lidocaine, and morphine. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/81 to 132/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's laboratory values show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and liver function tests. However, there is evidence of acute kidney injury (creatinine 0.6 mg/dL) and electrolyte imbalances (sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 3.5 mEq/L, chloride 26.4%, magnesium 2.0 mg/dL, phosphate 1.9 mg/dL).

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**].
- He is currently on chronic immunosuppression and has been hospitalized for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and now presents with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is using accessory muscles and exhibiting paradoxical breathing, indicating respiratory distress.
- He has diffuse rhonchi and expiratory wheezing bilaterally, and myoclonic jerks in his upper extremities.
- Laboratory results show hyponatremia, likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) associated with the lung process.
- The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for which he is receiving prophylactic enoxaparin.
- He also has a history of multiple vertebral fractures, which are not consistent with his pain assessment.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including immunosuppressants, antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He has been on chronic immunosuppression and has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He presented to the hospital with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now satting well on 4 liters of nasal cannula. He has completed a course of Zosyn for the ESBL E. coli pneumonia and finished Tamiflu. The patient's sodium levels are resolving and consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) along with his lung process. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient may continue to have fluctuations in oxygen requirements and may require further weaning of oxygen as tolerated. There is a risk of respiratory failure if not closely monitored.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are resolving, but there is a risk of developing hyponatremia due to SIADH. Close monitoring of fluid balance and sodium levels is necessary to prevent complications.
3. Chronic GVHD: The patient has a history of CML post BMT and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He is currently on multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment, including prednisone, cellcept, bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole. There is a risk of complications related to chronic GVHD, such as organ dysfunction or infections.
4. History of PE/DVT: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is on home dose lovenox for anticoagulation. There is a risk of recurrent PE or DVT if not adequately anticoagulated.
5. Multiple Vertebral Fractures: The patient has multiple vertebral fractures but reports that pain is well-controlled. There is a risk of further fracture complications or pain management issues.
6. ICU Care: The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, and electrolyte balance."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently being treated in the ICU for ESBL E. coli pneumonia, with right lung base and upper lobe infiltrate on X-Ray. He is on chronic immunosuppression and has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). His vital signs are stable, but he is using accessory muscles and exhibiting paradoxical breathing. He has bilateral lower extremity edema and myoclonic jerks in his upper extremities. His laboratory results show resolving hypotonic hyponatremia, likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's medical history includes pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), multiple vertebral fractures, and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is on multiple medications for prophylaxis against infections and immunosuppression. The plan is to wean oxygen as tolerated, continue physical therapy, and discuss tracheostomy placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)**]. The patient also needs to be on inhaled tobramycin for 4 weeks on, 4 weeks off, and switch intravenous medications to oral form."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) who presents with a history of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), recent hospitalizations, and current admission for esophageal pressure-negative (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/78 mmHg to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient appears ill-appearing but is able to talk in full sentences and has no acute distress. Physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchorous breath sounds with expiratory wheezing bilaterally, using accessory muscles, and paradoxical breathing. There is also mild distension of the abdomen, tender in the lower abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows myoclonic jerks in the upper extremities.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 291 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, low albumin level of 2.9 g/dL, elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L, and slightly low magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. He is currently on nasal cannula oxygen and has shown improvement in his oxygen saturation levels. The patient received small IVF boluses due to poor urine output. He was also restarted on inhaled Tobramycin.

His last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam on 10/5 at 4:32 PM and Acyclovir on 10/6 at 5:40 AM. Voriconazole was also started on 10/6 at 5:40 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/78 mmHg to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on the nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1977 mL, including 718 mL of IV fluids, 1120 mL of oral intake, and 857 mL of total IV fluids with an output of 561 mL of urine and 190 mL of blood products.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.3, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and HCO3- of 24.1 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is a post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) recipient with ongoing immunosuppression and on a slow prednisone taper for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to secretions in the setting of pneumonia and bronchial obliterans, as well as weakness. Oxygenation needs improvement. The patient requires continued suctioning, albuterol nebs, and prednisone nebs. Pain management is being provided with fentanyl, lidocaine, and morphine. The patient is eating well, maintaining glycemic control, and has a PICC line in place. Prophylactic measures are being taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and there is a consideration for rehab screening.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to secretions secondary to pneumonia. This condition can progress to worsening hypoxia and sepsis if not managed appropriately.
2. Bronchial Obliterans: The patient has bronchial obliterans, which can lead to airflow limitation and difficulty breathing. It may require additional interventions such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids.
3. GVHD: The patient is on immunosuppression and prednisone taper for GVHD. If not properly managed,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and bronchial obliterans. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics, steroids, and immunosuppression. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/78 to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse crackles and wheezes in the lungs, 2+ edema in the extremities, and no distress.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.3 K/uL, anemia with a Hct level of 24.1%, thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 291 K/uL, and elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 0.6 mg/dL, glucose at 188 mg/dL, and lactic acid at 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to experience respiratory distress due to secretions and bronchial obliterans, as well as weakness. The plan includes continued suctioning, nebulized bronchodilators, and prednisone. The patient's post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) will be managed with continued immunosuppression and slow prednisone taper. Pain control measures include fentanyl, lidocaine, and morphine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and steroid use can predispose the patient to stress ulcers. Gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be continued.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration are necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state makes him susceptible to infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and regular cultures are essential.
6. GVHD: The patient's recent allo-SCT and immunosuppressive therapy put him at risk for GVHD. Regular assessment of liver function and skin examination are important for early detection of GVHD.

The patient's progress in the ICU is summarized, and potential medical complications are identified based on the information provided."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU for severe pneumonia and subsequent allo-SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation). The patient has a history of GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and is currently on immunosuppression therapy with slow prednisone taper. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/78 mmHg to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is comfortable and shows no distress. Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles and wheezes in the lungs, 2+ edema in the extremities, and a supple neck. 

The patient's labs show normal WBC count, slightly low Hct and Plt levels, elevated Cr levels, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin-T levels, decreased albumin levels, and increased LDH levels. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, immunosuppressants, analgesics, and bronchodilators.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is due to secretions in the setting of pneumonia and bronchial obliterans. Improving"

   Disposition: ICU for now, being screened for LTACH
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He has been on chronic immunosuppression and has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, as evidenced by his ability to maintain oxygen saturation at 98% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. He has completed a course of antibiotics (Zosyn) for the ESBL E. coli pneumonia and is no longer on droplet precautions. The plan is to wean off oxygen as tolerated, continue physical therapy, and administer albuterol/ipratropium nebs. The patient will also continue receiving monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and inhaled tobramycin on a 4-week on, 4-week off schedule.

The patient is also being treated for hyponatremia, which is resolving consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) related to his lung process. Fluid balance should be maintained, and sodium levels should be monitored.

For his underlying condition of CML post-BMT and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the patient"

   1)Respiratory Failure-Much improved wtih stable O2 requirement across
   time and with continued pulmonary toilet has been able to maintain
   reasonable stability with nasal cannula O2 only.  The issue is that
   patient will have persistent ventilatory compromise and will likely
   need continued aggressive suctioning and intermittent positive pressure
   ventilatory support and use of the MIE.  OOB to chair will be important
   over time.
   -Continue nebs
   -Continue intermittent suctioning as needed going forward
as this will
   be requirement to maintain stability
   -MIE as tolerated
   -Consider NIV support at night of patient able.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently on chronic immunosuppression and has been hospitalized multiple times for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient presented with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia and was treated with an 8-day course of Zosyn. His respiratory status has improved, and he is now well-oxygenated on 4 liters of nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, which is resolving and consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) along with his lung process. His sodium levels should be trended, and fluid balance should be maintained.

The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and he is currently on enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. He has been restarted on metoprolol, which was previously stopped due to his low blood pressure.

The patient has multiple vertebral fractures but reports that his pain is well-controlled, except when exacerbated with movement. Pain service has signed off, and he is being managed with fentanyl patches, methadone, and lidocaine patches. Morphine IV can be considered for breakthrough pain.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in [**2121**]. He is currently admitted to the ICU for an episode of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and also has a recent hospitalization for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli pneumonia. The patient is on chronic immunosuppression and is still recovering from the BMT.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/70 mmHg to 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

Physical examination reveals diffusely rhonchorous breath sounds with expiratory wheezing bilaterally. The patient is using accessory muscles and exhibiting paradoxical breathing. There is no scleral icterus, and his abdomen is soft with mild distension and tenderness in the lower abdomen. Bilateral lower extremity edema is also noted.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, elevated lact"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with significant chronic obstructive lung disease and
   hosptial course complicated by prolonged course with need for very
   close care and pulmonary toilet to maintain secretion clearance.
   Importantly this has been limited by patient with significant pain in
   the setting of rib fracture.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is in the setting of obstructive lung
   disease as well as some significant chest wall restriction with rib
   fractures and pain.  He maintains intermittent collapse of lobar
   regions which is of concern.  The issue is with bronchoscopy is that we
   have concern for sedation of patient and persistent O2 requirements
   that bronchoscopy will result in substantial risk for intubation and
   not result in durable response in terms of airway clearance.  He will
   need continued support with PT, MIE and intermittent positive pressure
   ventilation.
   -Incentive spirometry 10x/hr while awake
   -MIE tid needed
   -Will move to pulmonary rehab today for ongoing care
   -Tracheostomy has been discussed and current description is that
   tracheostomy is not currently desired and will have to reconsider based
   upon patient course.
   2)Pain Control
   -Fentanyl 200
   -Lidocaine

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has been receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is experiencing chest pain, limiting his ability to perform pulmonary toilet. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/63 to 140/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 lpm NC. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's medical history is significant for rib fractures, and he has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, enoxaparin, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of his underlying COPD and the presence of rib fractures causing chest wall restriction and pain. Intermittent collapse of lobar regions is a concern, and the patient may require continued support with pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry, mechanical incentive expiration (MIE), and intermittent positive pressure ventilation.
2. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing significant pain due to rib fractures. Adequate pain management is crucial to facilitate pulmonary toilet and improve respiratory function. The patient is currently on fentanyl,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is currently experiencing various medical complications. 

The patient has recently recovered from an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli pneumonia and is still receiving oxygen supplementation through a nasal cannula. He has completed his course of antibiotics for the pneumonia and is no longer on droplet precautions. 

The patient also has hyponatremia, which has been resolved and is believed to be consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) along with his lung process. Fluid balance is being monitored, and sodium levels are being trended. 

The patient's chronic condition includes CML post-BMT and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He is on multiple medications including prednisone, cellcept, bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole for prophylaxis. He also requires regular follow-up with BMT recommendations. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is on low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) at home and continues to take metoprolol at a lower dose for now. 

The patient also has multiple vertebral fractures but reports that his pain is well-controlled, except"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2121**]. He has been on chronic immunosuppression and has had recent hospitalizations for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient is currently in the ICU with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/60 to 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his weight remains relatively unchanged. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 600 mL of total fluids and 240 mL of PO fluids, with outputs totaling 799 mL of urine and 344 mL of NG drainage, resulting in a negative balance of 199 mL. 

The patient is using accessory muscles and exhibiting paradoxical breathing while on a nasal cannula for respiratory support. Physical examination reveals diffusely rhonchorous breath sounds with expiratory wheezing bilaterally, mild abdominal distension, and bilateral lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with CML and significant obstructive lung disease now with
   persistent difficulty with clearance of secretions in the setting of
   improving pneumonia.  He has had extensive efforts made at use of MIE,
   flutter valve, incentive spirometry and chest PT which at this point
   has concluded in a path of treatment led by continued O2, use of
   flutter valve and incentive spirometry as primary modes of support with
   greatest yield in terms of maintaining optimized airway patency.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
does have excellent insight and
   capacities into the use of assist devices.  We do have ongoing support
   to be maintained as follows.
   -Albuterol
   -Continued usee of flutter valve
excellent technique
   -OOB and ambulation as possible
   -Continue with suctioning and incentive spirometry
   -Will wean gradually to 20mg qd
   2)Pain Control-
   -Fent Patch
   -Methadone
   3)Pneumonia-Tamiflu/Zosyn completed
   -Voriconazole
   -Bactrim QD
   -Tobra inhaled ongoing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient is experiencing persistent difficulty clearing secretions, and various interventions have been attempted to optimize airway patency.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is still requiring respiratory support.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, the blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 69 mg/dL and 188 mg/dL.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has chronic respiratory failure and is doing well with the use of assist devices such as flutter valve and incentive spirometry. The ongoing respiratory support will be maintained, along with weaning the patient gradually to 20 mg of albuterol per day.

The patient also has pain control issues, for which fentanyl patch and methadone have been prescribed. The pneumonia is being treated with antivirals and antibiotics, and the patient is currently on voriconazole, bactrim, and inhaled tobramycin.

Other ICU care includes nutrition through"
