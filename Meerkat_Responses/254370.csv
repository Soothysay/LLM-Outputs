   1. Bibasilar areas of consolidation and peribronchovascular
   ground-glass
   opacities, probably representing combination of atelectasis with
   possible
   aspiration, inflammation, and/or infection. Trace right pleural
   effusion.
   2. Patulous esophagus with circumferential wall thickening _____ fluid
   within
   the distal esophagus.
   3. Fluid within the mesentery and pelvis. Nonspecific thickening noted
   within some loops of small bowel and also the ascending colon. Findings
   are
   nonspecific, possibly representing enteritis and colitis. Appendix not
   visualized. No bowel obstruction seen.
   4. Area of hypoattenuation within the right hepatic lobe has somewhat
   rounded
   appearance but has vessels coursing through it, rendering abscess less
   likely.
   Findings could represent area of focal fatty infiltration or other
   benign
   entity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. He is currently intubated and sedated due to aspiration pneumonia. His condition has led to hypotension and sepsis, and he is being treated with vasopressor support. The patient also has cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis. He has a history of nonketotic hyperglycemic state (NKH) and is being managed with insulin and IV fluids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and imaging findings suggest aspiration pneumonia. He is already being treated with antibiotics and intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and organ dysfunction may indicate sepsis secondary to aspiration pneumonia. His blood cultures are pending, and he is receiving appropriate volume-repletion and vasopressor support.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, which could be related to DKA, sepsis, or other factors. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management are necessary.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with DKA, which has been partially treated. He requires ongoing management with insulin and IV fluids to resolve the ketoacidosis and ensure proper glycemic control.

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
   25 yo M with microcephaly/cerebral palsy who presents with DKA,
   hypernatremia, acute renal failure.
   .
   #  Diabetic ketoacidosis/Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic
   syndrome:  Pt with improving hyperglycemia with glucose 233, anion gap
   of 20, pH of 7.2, and ketones in urine.  This is a new diagnosis of
   likely DM.  Less likely to be DM1 given profound hyperglycemia.
   Trigger was likely the viral infection given bilateral conjunctivitis,
   fever.  Pt already had H1N1 and does not need Tamiflu.  CXR did not
   show an infiltrate.  Lipase and alk phos is also elevated, concerning
   for gallstone pancreatitis.  R groin also appears to have a fungal
   infection with some skin breakdown.  U/A was unremarkable for
   infection.  Pt may also be having slight cardiac ischemia given
   elevated CK and troponin of 0.4 with EKG with TWIs in precordial
   leads.
   -  insulin gtt
   - Volume-replete with 500 cc NS bolus, then 50 cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes q2 hours, replete K, Phos as needed
   - Transition to Lantus and HISS when gap closes
   - f/u bcxs, ucx
   - RUQ US
 cholelithiasis w/o cholecystitis
   - CEs x 3, serial EKGs
   .
   #  Hypernatremia:  Correct for hyperglycemia, sodium is 168.  Likely
   due to hypovolemic hypernatremia from osmotic diuresis from DKA and
   decreased po intake.
   - Volume-replete with D5W
   - Monitor electrolytes q3 hours
   .
   #  Acute renal failure:  Resolving with BUN 18, Cr 1.3.  Likely

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with hyperglycemia and altered mental status. He presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypernatremia. The patient also has acute renal failure, elevated lipase, and abnormal liver function tests. He has a history of microcephaly and cerebral palsy. The patient's condition was complicated by respiratory decompensation, leading to intubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis/Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome: The patient's profound hyperglycemia indicates a new diagnosis of likely diabetes mellitus (DM), specifically type 2 DM due to the absence of ketones in the urine. This condition is triggered by a viral infection.
2. Gallstone pancreatitis: Elevated lipase and alkaline phosphatase levels suggest the possibility of gallstone pancreatitis.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which could be due to hypovolemic hypernatremia resulting from osmotic diuresis caused by DKA and decreased oral intake.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but further monitoring is required.
5. Mental status changes: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to DKA and electrolyte imbalances. Other possible diagnoses include meningitis, seizures, or medication side effects.
6. Thrombocytopenia"

   GI
   # Heme positive emesis
 RUQ US showed cholelithiasis w/o
   cholecystitis.  Pt hematocrit remains stable.
   - Continue protonix.
   - Continue monitoring HCT.
   Patient was hypotensive with thrombocytopenia.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending
   #  Diabetic ketoacidosis/Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic
   syndrome:  Pt with improving hyperglycemia with glucose 233, anion gap
   of 20, pH of 7.2, and ketones in urine.  This is a new diagnosis of
   likely DM.  Less likely to be DM1 given profound hyperglycemia.
   Trigger was likely the viral infection given bilateral conjunctivitis,
   fever.  Pt already had H1N1 and does not need Tamiflu.  CXR did not
   show an infiltrate.  Lipase and alk phos is also elevated, concerning
   for gallstone pancreatitis.  R groin also appears to have a fungal
   infection with some skin breakdown.  U/A was unremarkable for
   infection.  Troponins were unremarkable.
   - Volume-replete with LR
   - Continue with insulin drip
   - Monitor electrolytes and replete K and Phos as needed.
   #  Hypernatremia:  Correct for hyperglycemia, sodium is 168.  Likely
   due to hypovolemic hypernatremia from osmotic diuresis from DKA and
   decreased po intake.
   - Volume-replete with D5W
   - Monitor electrolytes q3 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a new diagnosis of likely diabetes mellitus, presenting with hyperglycemia, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. He has a history of microcephaly and cerebral palsy. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, heme-positive emesis, cholelithiasis without cholecystitis, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia. He is intubated and receiving volume control ventilation. He is being treated with insulin, antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam), and other medications as needed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose, anion gap, pH, ketones in urine, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase. Imaging studies reveal bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and CT scan, along with findings consistent with gallstone pancreatitis and possible fungal infection in the groin. Blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

   are
   nonspecific, possibly representing enteritis and colitis. Appendix not
   visualized. No bowel obstruction seen.
   4. Area of hypoattenuation within the right hepatic lobe has somewhat
   rounded
   appearance but has vessels coursing through it, rendering abscess less
   likely.
   Findings could represent area of focal fatty infiltration or other

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
   25 yo M with microcephaly/cerebral palsy who presents with DKA,
   hypernatremia, acute renal failure.
   Respiratory:
   # Acute respiratory failure
 Patient has hypoxic, hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Likely source is aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis
   identified on CT and CXR.
   - Abx: Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam
   - Intubation: volume control
   - Sedation with fentanyl, midazolam.
   Cardiovascular:
   # Sepsis: likely a result of aspiration pneumonia.
   - Phenylephrine 0.5-5 mcg/kg/min IV drip. Titrate to MAP >55
   - Blood and urine cultures pending
   - Continue volume-repletion with LR to CVP 10-12.
   # L Groin edema: asymmetry noted on exam. Likely a result of systemic
   inflammation and increased permeability.
   - L groin ultrasound to rule out pseudoaneurysm/clot.
   Metabolic:
   #Acidosis: Likely a combination of anion gap acidosis (DKA, sepsis) and
   nongap.  Patient also likely has chronic respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation.
   - Continue frequent VBG checks as glucose and infection, and
   respiration are controlled.
   Endocrine
   #  DKA/HHNonK syndrome:  Possible inciting events: viral
   gastroenteritis, fungal skin infection.  U/A was unremarkable for
   infection.  Troponins were unremarkable.
   Current labs: glucose = 408, Na = 168
   - Continue maintenance with D5W or D5
 NS.
   - Continue with insulin drip and IV insulin as needed.
   - Monitor Chem7 every 3 hours.  Replete K and Phos as needed.
   Renal
   # Acute renal failure
 Patient presented with elevated BUN and Cr.
   Likely cause is prerenal from DKA/HHS diuresis.
   - Will continue to rehydrate and monitor BUN/Cr and urine output.
   GI
   # Heme positive emesis

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. He is currently intubated due to acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis identified on CT and CXR. The patient is also septic, likely as a result of the aspiration pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with DKA/HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state) and is receiving insulin therapy. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: heart rate (HR) 117 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 48 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 97%, and temperature (T) 37.2°C. 

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities: high blood glucose levels, high sodium levels, elevated BUN and creatinine indicating renal dysfunction, and heme-positive emesis. His coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, possibly due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or sepsis-induced coagulopathy. 

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam) and is being aggressively rehydrated. His blood cultures are pending, and he is also being monitored for potential complications"

   #  Diabetic ketoacidosis/Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic
   syndrome:  Pt with improving hyperglycemia with glucose 233, anion gap
   of 20, pH of 7.2, and ketones in urine.  This is a new diagnosis of
   likely DM.  Less likely to be DM1 given profound hyperglycemia.
   Trigger was likely the viral infection given bilateral conjunctivitis,
   fever.  Pt already had H1N1 and does not need Tamiflu.  CXR did not
   show an infiltrate.  Lipase and alk phos is also elevated, concerning
   for gallstone pancreatitis.  R groin also appears to have a fungal
   infection with some skin breakdown.  U/A was unremarkable for
   infection.  Pt may also be having slight cardiac ischemia given
   elevated CK and troponin of 0.4 with EKG with TWIs in precordial
   leads.

   #  Hypernatremia:  Correct for hyperglycemia, sodium is 168.  Likely
   due to hypovolemic hypernatremia from osmotic diuresis from DKA and
   decreased po intake.
   - Volume-replete with D5W
   - Monitor electrolytes q3 hours
   .
   #  Acute renal failure:  Resolving with BUN 18, Cr 1.3.  Likely
   pre-renal.
   - check urine lytes, sed.
   - IVFs as above
   .
   #  Elevated lipase:  Concern for gallstone pancreatitis.
   - IVFs as above
   - monitor lipase
   .
   #  Abnormal LFTs:  Elevations in AST/ALT likely due to hemolysis.  Alk
   phos also elevated.  With elevated lipase, concern for gallstone
   pancreatitis.
   - monitor LFTs
   - RUQ ultrasound
   .
   #  Mental status changes:  Likely due to DKA and electrolyte
   abnormalities.  Other diagnoses to consider include meningitis (though
   no real exposures and parents declined LP), seizures (erratic nystamgus
   on exam but on valium).  Per family, MS seems to be improving.
   - treat DKA and electrolyte abnormalities as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a new diagnosis of likely diabetes mellitus (DM), with profound hyperglycemia as the trigger. The viral infection is suspected to be the trigger for DKA. The patient also has elevated lipase levels, indicating a possible gallstone pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient has a fungal infection in the groin area with skin breakdown. There are concerns about cardiac ischemia due to elevated CK and troponin levels. 

The patient's hypernatremia is being corrected by infusing D5W, and electrolyte levels are being monitored closely. Acute renal failure is resolving, and the patient's BUN and creatinine levels are improving. 

The patient's mental status changes are likely due to DKA and electrolyte imbalances. Other potential causes, such as meningitis or seizures, are being considered but seem less likely. Thrombocytopenia is present, but the etiology is unclear. 

Further plans include monitoring the patient's blood cultures, urine cultures, and stool cultures. The patient will continue to receive IV fluids, diabetic diet, H2RA, heparin, and bowel regimen. The left internal jugular vein has been placed for access. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for now."

   - vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per pharm)
   - Piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H (per pharm)
   - fluconazole 200 mg IV Q24H day 1 [**2-2**]
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Titrate to SBP by cuff >85
   - blood and fecal cultures pending
   - blood fungal cultures pending
   - CT sinus and CT torso ordered
   - CXR ordered
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 On [**1-4**] patient was intubated after CXR
   and CT documented aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Pt
s anatomy makes
   him a chronic CO2 retainer and unable to ventilate in setting of
   metabolic acidosis (see below).
   - continue ventilation: pressure support (settings: FIO2=60%,
   PSV=15cmH2O, PEEP=5cm H2O).
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
   - continue lactate checks
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Between [**1-4**] and [**1-5**] patient had poor urine
   output. Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. He has developed aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and systemic inflammatory involvement. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole. The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, left lower extremity/groin edema, and abdominal distention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia or other complications such as barotrauma or volutrauma.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen and progress to chronic kidney disease.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis could indicate diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
5. Pneumonia: The aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis may worsen and lead to secondary infections or lung abscesses.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis: Despite"

 Patient appears to be in septic shock.  Not fluid
   responisive.  Source possibilities: blood, urine, lungs, skin. Sputum
   showed 4+ yeast and 1+ GPC in pairs. Stool negative for C. diff.
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H (per pharm)
   - vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per pharm)
   - piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H (per pharm)
   - fluconazole 200 mg IV Q24H day 1 [**2-2**]
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Titrate to SBP by cuff >85
   - blood and fecal cultures pending
   - blood fungal cultures pending
   - CT sinus and CT torso ordered
   - CXR ordered
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 On [**1-4**] patient was intubated after CXR
   and CT documented aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Pt
s anatomy makes
   him a chronic CO2 retainer and unable to ventilate in setting of
   metabolic acidosis (see below).
   - continue ventilation: pressure support (settings: FIO2=60%,
   PSV=15cmH2O, PEEP=5cm H2O).
Pressure support, 15 over 5, at 60%).
   Changed to assist control (settings: RR=24, TV=230, FIO2=60%)
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
   - continue lactate checks
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Between [**1-4**] and [**1-5**] patient had poor urine
   output. Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
   - dose meds to creatinine clearance of zero.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
 Pt originally presented in DKA with
   previously unknown diabetes.
   Persisting even on insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin
   resistance due to acidosis, infection, and pressors.  They recommend
   increasing insulin up to 40U/hr until glucose within 140-180 range.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every
   hour
 LLE/GROIN EDEMA

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. He is now experiencing aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and systemic inflammatory involvement. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, acute renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including insulin resistance, metabolic acidosis, and fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of septic shock, with inadequate fluid responsiveness and potential sources of infection including blood, urine, lungs, and skin. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis. He is currently on pressure support ventilation and assist-control ventilation.
3. Mixed Acidosis: The patient has mixed metabolic acidosis due to DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), and uremia. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from poor perfusion. Close monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output is essential.
5. Hyperglycemia and Hyponatremia: The patient has persistently elevated blood glucose levels despite an insulin drip. Insulin resistance"

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia, now with intubation.
   To assess for change.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there
   appears
   to be increasing opacification at the right base, suggesting worsening
   of the
   aspiration pneumonia. Somewhat less prominent changes are also seen at
   the
   left base.
   The endotracheal tube tip cannot be seen due to overlying metallic
   devices.

   Final Report
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH
   INDICATION: Evaluation for interval change.
   COMPARISON: [**1-2**] and [**2107-1-3**].
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a newly appeared
   extensive
   opacity in the lung parenchyma is seen both at the bases of the right
   and of
   the left lung. The opacities were not visible on the previous
   radiographs.
   The opacities are strongly suggestive of bilateral aspiration
   pneumonias.
   Otherwise, no relevant change is detected. No evidence of larger
   pleural
   effusions. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The
   referring
   physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2582**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2391**] was paged and notified at the time of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. The patient is now experiencing aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and systemic inflammatory involvement. 

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The vital signs indicate hypotension (97/29 mmHg), tachypnea (RR: 27 breaths per minute), and a slightly elevated body temperature (Tcurrent: 35.6 C). The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal range (SpO2: 98%). 

Laboratory results show leukopenia (WBC: 1.4 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (Plt: 74), elevated blood glucose levels (Glucose: 533 mg/dL), and renal failure (Cr: 1.4). The basic coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT (1.4*) and PTT (41.0*). 

Radiology findings reveal worsening opacification at the right base, suggesting worsening aspiration pneumonia, with less prominent changes at the left base. There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions or changes in the cardiac silhouette. 

The assessment and plan include the management of shock, respiratory failure, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, and other associated problems. The patient is on broad-spectrum"

   PSV=15cmH2O, PEEP=5cm H2O).
Pressure support, 15 over 5, at 60%).
   Changed to assist control (settings: RR=24, TV=230, FIO2=60%)
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
   - continue lactate checks
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Between [**1-4**] and [**1-5**] patient had poor urine
   output. Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
 Pt originally presented in DKA with
   previously unknown diabetes.
   Persisting even on insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin
   resistance due to acidosis, infection, and pressors.  They recommend
   increasing insulin up to 40U/hr until glucose within 140-180 range.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. Currently, the patient is experiencing aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and systemic inflammatory involvement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 97/29 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function test results. The coagulation profile indicates a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. The source of infection is suspected to be either the blood, urine, lungs, or skin. Cultures have been obtained from various sites, including blood, urine, stool, and sputum.

The patient's medical management includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, vasopressor support, and insulin therapy. Additionally, the patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding.

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia, now with intubation.
   To assess for change.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there
   appears
   to be increasing opacification at the right base, suggesting worsening
   of the
   aspiration pneumonia. Somewhat less prominent changes are also seen at
   the
   left base.
   The endotracheal tube tip cannot be seen due to overlying metallic
   devices.

   Final Report
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH
   INDICATION: Evaluation for interval change.
   COMPARISON: [**1-2**] and [**2107-1-3**].
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a newly appeared
   extensive
   opacity in the lung parenchyma is seen both at the bases of the right
   and of
   the left lung. The opacities were not visible on the previous
   radiographs.
   The opacities are strongly suggestive of bilateral aspiration
   pneumonias.
   Otherwise, no relevant change is detected. No evidence of larger
   pleural
   effusions. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The
   referring
   physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2582**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2391**] was paged and notified at the time of

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. He now has aspiration pneumonia and systemic inflammatory involvement. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, insulin, and other ICU medications. His current conditions include shock, acute respiratory failure, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, lower extremity/groin edema, abdominal pain, oliguria/anuria, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, peripheral edema, leukopenia, acute thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which is a common complication in individuals with impaired swallowing or cough reflexes.
2. Systemic inflammatory involvement: The patient's systemic inflammatory response may lead to complications such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the aspiration pneumonia and underlying lung disease.
4. Mixed acidosis: The patient has both metabolic and respiratory acidosis, which can further complicate his respiratory status.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may be compromised due to hypoperfusion and the effects of sepsis.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's persistently"

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy presenting with fever, hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, academia, and sepsis. He is intubated and on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and poor perfusion. He has edema in both lower extremities, particularly in the left thigh and groin area. The patient's abdomen is distended, and he has oliguria/anuria. His blood glucose levels are persistently high despite insulin infusion.

The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, but it is currently stable without any ECG changes. He also has altered mental status, peripheral edema, thrombocytopenia (now resolving), and hypernatremia (normalizing).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. His electrolytes are abnormal, with high potassium and chloride levels. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are within normal limits.

Microbiology cultures have been taken from blood, stool, sputum, and urine. The gram stain of the sputum sample shows gram-positive cocci in pairs, along with yeast.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and other complications."

","The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. He was intubated yesterday morning and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are as follows: heart rate (HR) 79 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 93/33 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 97%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 74%, and the patient has a positive fluid balance of 7,738 mL.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 1.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 74 K/uL, and acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 80 mg/dL and creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's glucose level is persistently elevated at 408 mg/dL despite insulin infusion.

The patient has edema in the lower extremities and is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia due to the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and yeast in the sputum gram stain. The patient's abdominal pain is attributed to abdominal distention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy presenting with fever, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), sepsis, respiratory failure, and academia. He is intubated on phenylephrine, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and appears to be in shock. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has had multiple urine, stool, and sputum cultures taken.

The patient has a history of severe hypovolemia and osmotic diuresis. His central venous saturation (CVP) is at 70%. He requires continued phenylephrine infusion, titrated to systolic blood pressure (SBP) around 85 mmHg. Arterial access has not been established due to difficulty, and his blood pressures may not accurately reflect his arterial pressures.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure, which is concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is hypoventilatory, with chronic CO2 retention and unable to adequately ventilate in the setting of metabolic acidosis. The chest X-ray is concerning for ARDS versus volume overload. The patient has been switched to pressure support and is breathing well with good tidal volume. He will continue to require ventilatory support.

The patient is experiencing mixed acidosis, likely due to a combination of metabolic acidosis from NG tube feeds and respiratory acidosis from chronic CO2 retention. His labs are slowly resolving,"

   IMPRESSIONS:
   1. Diffuse mild mucosal thickening with layering high-density fluid
   seen
   throughout the paranasal sinuses. Fungal colonization is not excluded,
   nor is
   infection.
   2. Area of demineralization along the superior aspect of the medial
   right
   maxillary sinus wall.
   3. Opacification of the [**Last Name (un) 1292**] and oropharynx, with ET tube and NG tube
   in
   place.
   4. Partial opacification of the visualized right mastoid air cells.
   5. Marked ventriculomegaly with very thin cerebral cortex, incompletely
   visualized on the current study.

   CT Abdomen Pelvis
   Preliminary Report !! [**Year (4 digits) 12994**] !!
   1. Extensive right lung and left lower lobe consolidations with air
   bronchograms are new compared to two days prior, with increased left
   greate than right small pleural effusions.
   2. Foley balloon catheter located within the urinary bladder. There is
   new
   diffuse anasarca with slight increase in small ascites. No definite
   findings
   to account for increased abdominal pressure otherwise.
   3. While small bowel loops which are better distended today show no
   wall
   thickening, there is apparent persistent wall thickening along the
   ascending
   and descending colon, representing non-specific colitis.
   4. Patulous esophagus with circumferential wall thickening, again
   possibly representing esophagitis. Intraluminal fluid extends to the
   thoracic inlet,
   increasing risk for aspiration.
   5. Rounded peripheral hypodense region in the right hepatic lobe
   re-demonstrated on non-contrast study, probably representing focal
   fatty infiltration.

 SHOCK
 Patient appears to be in septic shock.  CVP 8. Not fluid
   responisive.  Source possibilities: blood, urine, lungs, skin. Sputum
   showed 4+ yeast and 1+ GPC in pairs. Urine cultures negative. Stool
   negative for C. diff.  CT sinus and CT torso do not reveal source of
   infection.
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H (per pharm)
   - vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per pharm)
   - piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H (per pharm)
   - fluconazole 200 mg IV Q24H day 1 [**2-2**]
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Titrate to MAP by cuff >60.
   - blood and fecal cultures pending
   - blood fungal cultures pending
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 On [**1-4**] patient was intubated after CXR
   and CT documented aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Pt
s anatomy makes
   him a chronic CO2 retainer and unable to ventilate in setting of
   metabolic acidosis (see below).
   - continue ventilation: Changed to assist control (settings: RR=24,
   TV=280, FIO2=60%)
280 by 24 at 60% with PEEP 5
 Breathing at 26.
   - pressure support trial.
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
   - continue lactate checks
   - follow lung appearance with daily CXR.
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
   - dose meds to creatinine clearance of zero.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
 Pt originally presented in DKA with
   previously unknown diabetes.
   [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin resistance due to acidosis, infection,
   and pressors.  They recommended increasing insulin up to 40U/hr until
   glucose within 140-180 range.
   Overnight glucose came under control and patient even became
   hypoglycemic.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every
   hour.
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION
 Pt abdomen firm and distended.  Possibility of
   intra abdominal process.  Bladder pressure readings were 190-200(?). CT
   scan showed no acute abdominal pathology.  Bladder pressure likely a
   result of patient
s unique anatomy and some generalized GI
   inflammation.
   - Continue to follow CK, lactate, and perform abdominal exams.
   > ANEMIA
s hematocrit has been dropping since admission.  Plts
   dropping.  Concern for TTP and DIC.
   - Give two units blood and recheck labs.
   - Stop subcutaneous heparin.
   - RBC morphology
   - Recheck DIC labs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently aspirated, leading to respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and started on broad antibiotic coverage. The patient remains in septic shock, and potential sources of infection include the blood, urine, lungs, and skin. The patient's sputum showed 4+ yeast and 1+ GPC in pairs, while urine cultures were negative. Stool cultures were negative for Clostridium difficile toxin. CT scans did not reveal a source of infection.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and requires continued ventilation. Blood and fecal cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics.

The patient has mixed metabolic acidosis, which is slowly resolving, and acute renal failure. Lactate checks are being continued, and daily CXRs will monitor lung appearance.

The patient's abdomen is firm and distended, but CT scan showed no acute abdominal pathology. Bladder pressure readings were high, but this is likely due to the patient's unique anatomy and generalized GI inflammation.

The patient has hyperglycemia and hypernatremia, initially presenting with DKA and previously unknown diabetes. Insulin resistance is due to acidosis, infection, and pressors. Insulin is being adjusted to maintain blood glucose within the target range.

   thickening, there is apparent persistent wall thickening along the
   ascending
   and descending colon, representing non-specific colitis.
   4. Patulous esophagus with circumferential wall thickening, again
   possibly representing esophagitis. Intraluminal fluid extends to the
   thoracic inlet,
   increasing risk for aspiration.
   5. Rounded peripheral hypodense region in the right hepatic lobe
   re-demonstrated on non-contrast study, probably representing focal
   fatty infiltration.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK
 Patient appears to be in septic shock.  CVP 8. Not fluid
   responisive.  Source possibilities: blood, urine, lungs, skin. Sputum
   showed 4+ yeast and 1+ GPC in pairs. Urine cultures negative. Stool
   negative for C. diff.  CT sinus and CT torso do not reveal source of
   infection, but CT sinus cannot rule out fungal or bacterial infection.
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H (per pharm)
   - vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per pharm)
   - piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H (per pharm)
   - fluconazole 200 mg IV Q24H day 1 [**2-2**]
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Titrate to MAP by cuff >70.
   4.2mg/kg/min not too high.
   - blood (fungus and bacteria) and fecal cultures pending
   - continue lactate checks
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 On [**1-4**] patient was intubated after CXR
   and CT documented aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Pt
s anatomy makes
   him a chronic CO2 retainer and unable to ventilate in setting of
   metabolic acidosis (see below).
   - continue ventilation: Changed to assist control (settings: RR=24,
   TV=280, FIO2=60%)
280 by 24 at 60% with PEEP 5
 Breathing at 26.
   - pressure support trial.  Want tidal volumes 240-250ml considering
   patient
s height of [**3-9**]
   - lower FiO2 to 50%
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.  Urine output
   rising, however, BUN and Cre up.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
   - dose antibiotics to creatinine clearance of zero.
   - continue monitoring urine output.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
 Pt originally presented in DKA with
   previously unknown diabetes.
   [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin resistance due to acidosis, infection,
   and pressors.  They recommended increasing insulin up to 40U/hr until
   glucose within 140-180 range.
   Overnight glucose came under control and patient even became
   hypoglycemic.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every
   hour.
   - Free H2O boluses via OG tube for hypernatremia ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs).
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION
 Pt abdomen firm and distended.  Possibility of
   intra abdominal process.  Bladder pressure readings were 190-200(?). CT
   scan showed no acute abdominal pathology.  Bladder pressure likely a
   result of patient
s unique anatomy and some generalized GI
   inflammation.
   Patient
s CK rising likely a result of global low grade
   rhabdomyolysis.
   - Continue to increase urine flow with pressors.  Neither lasix nor
   bicarb not appropriate at this time.
   - Continue to follow CK, lactate, and perform abdominal exams.
 ANEMIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA
s hematocrit and plts dropping.
   Concern for TTP and DIC.
   - Stop subcutaneous heparin given thrombocytopenia
   - RBC morphology
   - Recheck DIC labs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Begin tube feeds.

","The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently aspirated, leading to respiratory failure. He was intubated and started on broad antibiotic and antifungal coverage. The patient is currently in septic shock, with positive yeast and GPC in pairs seen in the sputum, indicating a possible fungal infection. Urine cultures are negative, and stool is negative for Clostridium difficile toxin. CT scans do not reveal a source of infection but cannot rule out fungal or bacterial infection.

The patient has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis. He is currently on assist control ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate of 24, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Pressure support trials are being considered.

The patient has mixed metabolic acidosis with contributors including early renal failure, dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3- free NS fluid), DKA, and lactic acidosis (sepsis). Labs are slowly resolving.

Renal failure is suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from poor perfusion. BUN and creatinine levels are rising despite urine output. Chem. 10 checks will continue, and antibiotics will be dosed to creatinine clearance of zero.

Hyperglycemia and hypernatremia were present initially, but the patient became hyp"

   Imaging: CT Sinus
   IMPRESSIONS:
   1. Diffuse mild mucosal thickening with layering high-density fluid
   seen
   throughout the paranasal sinuses. Fungal colonization is not excluded,
   nor is
   infection.
   2. Area of demineralization along the superior aspect of the medial
   right
   maxillary sinus wall.
   3. Opacification of the [**Last Name (un) 1292**] and oropharynx, with ET tube and NG tube
   in
   place.
   4. Marked ventriculomegaly with very thin cerebral cortex, incompletely
   visualized on the current study.

   CT Abdomen Pelvis
   Preliminary Report !! [**Year (4 digits) 12994**] !!
   1. Extensive right lung and left lower lobe consolidations with air
   bronchograms are new compared to two days prior, with increased left
   greate than right small pleural effusions.
   2. Foley balloon catheter located within the urinary bladder. There is
   new
   diffuse anasarca with slight increase in small ascites. No definite
   findings
   to account for increased abdominal pressure otherwise.
   3. While small bowel loops which are better distended today show no
   wall
   thickening, there is apparent persistent wall thickening along the
   ascending
   and descending colon, representing non-specific colitis.
   4. Patulous esophagus with circumferential wall thickening, again
   possibly representing esophagitis. Intraluminal fluid extends to the
   thoracic inlet,
   increasing risk for aspiration.
   5. Rounded peripheral hypodense region in the right hepatic lobe
   re-demonstrated on non-contrast study, probably representing focal
   fatty infiltration.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK
 Patient appears to be in septic shock.  CVP 8. Not fluid
   responisive.  Source possibilities: blood, urine, lungs, skin. Sputum
   showed 4+ yeast and 1+ GPC in pairs. Urine cultures negative. Stool
   negative for C. diff.  CT sinus and CT torso do not reveal source of
   infection, but CT sinus cannot rule out fungal or bacterial infection.
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H (per pharm)
   - vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per pharm)
   - piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H (per pharm)
   - fluconazole 200 mg IV Q24H day 1 [**2-2**]
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Titrate to MAP by cuff >70.
   4.2mg/kg/min not too high.
   - blood (fungus and bacteria) and fecal cultures pending
   - continue lactate checks
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 On [**1-4**] patient was intubated after CXR
   and CT documented aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Pt
s anatomy makes
   him a chronic CO2 retainer and unable to ventilate in setting of
   metabolic acidosis (see below).
   - continue ventilation: Changed to assist control (settings: RR=24,
   TV=280, FIO2=60%)
280 by 24 at 60% with PEEP 5
 Breathing at 26.
   - pressure support trial.  Want tidal volumes 240-250ml considering
   patient
s height of [**3-9**]
   - lower FiO2 to 50%
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.  Urine output
   rising, however, BUN and Cre up.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
   - dose antibiotics to creatinine clearance of zero.
   - continue monitoring urine output.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
 Pt originally presented in DKA with
   previously unknown diabetes.
   [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin resistance due to acidosis, infection,
   and pressors.  They recommended increasing insulin up to 40U/hr until
   glucose within 140-180 range.
   Overnight glucose came under control and patient even became
   hypoglycemic.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every
   hour.
   - Free H2O boluses via OG tube for hypernatremia ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs).
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION
 Pt abdomen firm and distended.  Possibility of
   intra abdominal process.  Bladder pressure readings were 190-200(?). CT
   scan showed no acute abdominal pathology.  Bladder pressure likely a
   result of patient
s unique anatomy and some generalized GI
   inflammation.
   Patient
s CK rising likely a result of global low grade
   rhabdomyolysis.
   - Continue to increase urine flow with pressors.  Neither lasix nor
   bicarb not appropriate at this time.
   - Continue to follow CK, lactate, and perform abdominal exams.
 ANEMIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA
s hematocrit and plts dropping.
   Concern for TTP and DIC.
   - Stop subcutaneous heparin given thrombocytopenia
   - RBC morphology
   - Recheck DIC labs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Begin tube feeds.

   PGY-1 ADDENDUM
   Patient seen and examined. Opened eyes this morning. Belly still firm
   but having bowel movements. Urine output improved. Plan as above.
   In brief, by problem:
 SHOCK
   -Continue antibiotcs: cipro, vanc (dosed by level), zosyn, fluconazole
   -Continue phenylephine but add vasopressin to improve renal perusion
   and also help with electrolytes
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   - trial of pressure support  as long as tidal volumes are in 240-250
   range
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
   - continue to monitor
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
   -increase pressure to offset intraabdominal pressure which seems to be
   impairing perfusion
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
   -continue with insulin gtt protocol (currently has had low sugars so no
   insulin but would avoid subcutaneous insulin as will be difficult to
   dose and monitor.
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION
   -follow urine output, increase pressors
   - Continue to follow CK, lactate, and perform abdominal exams.
 ANEMIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA
s hematocrit and plts dropping.
   Concern for TTP and DIC.
   - Stop subcutaneous heparin given thrombocytopenia
   - RBC morphology
   - Recheck DIC labs

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He aspirated and developed respiratory failure, leading to intubation and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal coverage. The patient is currently on pressors and has a history of diabetes. His current condition includes septic shock, acute respiratory failure, mixed metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, abdominal distention, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state from septic shock and the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

2. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.

4. Diabetic complications: The patient's underlying diabetes increases his risk of developing long-term complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.

5. Thrombotic events: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia raise concerns for thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary"

   IMPRESSIONS:
   1. Diffuse mild mucosal thickening with layering high-density fluid
   seen
   throughout the paranasal sinuses. Fungal colonization is not excluded,
   nor is
   infection.
   2. Area of demineralization along the superior aspect of the medial
   right
   maxillary sinus wall.
   3. Opacification of the [**Last Name (un) 1292**] and oropharynx, with ET tube and NG tube
   in

   4. Partial opacification of the visualized right mastoid air cells.
   5. Marked ventriculomegaly with very thin cerebral cortex, incompletely
   visualized on the current study.

   CT Abdomen Pelvis
   Preliminary Report !! [**Year (4 digits) 12994**] !!
   1. Extensive right lung and left lower lobe consolidations with air
   bronchograms are new compared to two days prior, with increased left
   greate than right small pleural effusions.
   2. Foley balloon catheter located within the urinary bladder. There is
   new
   diffuse anasarca with slight increase in small ascites. No definite
   findings
   to account for increased abdominal pressure otherwise.
   3. While small bowel loops which are better distended today show no
   wall
   thickening, there is apparent persistent wall thickening along the
   ascending
   and descending colon, representing non-specific colitis.
   4. Patulous esophagus with circumferential wall thickening, again
   possibly representing esophagitis. Intraluminal fluid extends to the
   thoracic inlet,
   increasing risk for aspiration.
   5. Rounded peripheral hypodense region in the right hepatic lobe
   re-demonstrated on non-contrast study, probably representing focal
   fatty infiltration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He subsequently developed respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal coverage and is receiving pressors. The patient's medical history includes allergies to Name2 (NI) and known drug allergies. He has received antibiotics including Vancomycin, Fluconazole, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Ciprofloxacin. 

24-hour events:
- Bladder pressure is approximately 90 cm
- Increased phenylephrine with improved mean arterial pressure (MAP), urine output
- Holding vancomycin until trough level is less than 20
- Stopped insulin drip (glucose in the hundreds) and started dextrose infusion
- Increased free fluid flushes (patient has a 1.5L fluid deficit)

Assessment and plan:
- ICU care
- Nutrition: Glycemic control, see above
- Lines: 20-gauge left IJ multi-lumen line placed
- Prophylaxis: DVT - subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer - proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK
 Patient appears to be in septic shock.  CVP 8. Not fluid
   responisive.  Source possibilities: blood, urine, lungs, skin.
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H (per pharm)
   - vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per pharm)
   - piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H (per pharm)
   - fluconazole 200 mg IV Q24H day 1 [**2-2**]
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Vasopressin added.  Titrate to
   MAP by cuff >65.
   - blood (fungus and bacteria) and fecal cultures pending
   - continue lactate checks
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   - continue ventilation: assist control (settings: RR=24, TV=280,
   FIO2=40% with PEEP 5)
   - pressure support trial.  want tidal volumes 240-250ml considering
   patient
s height of [**3-9**]
   - lower FiO2 to 30%
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.  Urine output
   rising, however, BUN and Cre up.
   - continue chem. 10 checks
   - continue dosing antibiotics to creatinine clearance of zero.
   - continue monitoring urine output.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA and HYPERNATREMIA
 Pt originally presented in DKA with
   previously unknown diabetes.
   [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin resistance due to acidosis, infection,
   and pressors.  They recommended increasing insulin up to 40U/hr until
   glucose within 140-180 range.  Overnight glucose rose again into 300s.
   Hypernatremia improving.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every
   hour.
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION and RHABDO
 Abd remains distended. CT scan
   showed no acute abdominal pathology.  Patient
s CK rising likely a
   result of global low grade rhabdomyolysis.
   - continue to increase urine flow with pressors.
   - start lasix 10mg
   - continue to follow CK, lactate, and perform abdominal exams.
 ANEMIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA
s hematocrit and plts dropping.  DIC
   labs were negative (no DIC), RBC morphology was normal (no TTP).
   - continue blood transfusions to keep HCT> 21.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Continue tube feeds.
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale, Insulin infusion
   restarted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy and microcephaly admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He was intubated after experiencing aspiration and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient now has sepsis, renal failure, and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels.

24-hour events:
- Blood cultures were taken at 10:00 PM and 10:25 PM.
- The patient's CK levels continued to rise above 12,000.
- Pediatric pneumoboots could not be located.
- The patient is receiving a blood transfusion due to falling hematocrit (HCT).
- Glucose fingersticks are increasing, and an insulin drip was restarted.
- Ventilator settings were lowered to FiO2 40% without success.
- No known drug allergies.
- Last doses of antibiotics were administered on 01/04/2107 at 08:51 PM, 01/06/2107 at 08:00 AM, 01/06/2107 at 06:00 PM, and 01/07/2107 at 02:00 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK
 Patient appears to be in septic shock.  CVP 8. Was previously
   not fluid responsive.  Source possibilities: blood, urine, lungs, skin.
   - ciprofloxacin, vancomycin: discontinued until level < 20 reached (per
   pharm), piperacillin-tazobactam, fluconazole
   - phenylephrine 0.5-5 mg/kg/min IV drip. Vasopressin added.  Titrate to
   MAP by cuff >65, attempting to wean phenylephrine.
   - blood (fungus and bacteria) and fecal cultures pending. Continue
   lactate checks.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   - continue ventilation: assist control (settings: RR=24, TV=280,
   FIO2=40% with PEEP 5)
   - pressure support trial
 use pressure 20 and PEEP 5, want tidal
   volumes 240-250ml considering patient
s height of [**3-9**]
   - no need to lower FiO2 to 30% bc pts can be taken off vent from 40%
   - continue broad antibiotic coverage as above
   - repeat CXR to follow pneumonia/pneumonitis progression
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 Nongap contributors: early renal failure,
   dilutional (rapid infusion of HCO3 free NS fluid). Gap contributors:
   DKA, lactic acidosis (sepsis), uremia.  Labs slowly resolving.
   - continue AVG checks
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Suspect ATN from poor perfusion.  Urine output
   rising, however, BUN and Cre up.
   - continue chem. 10 checks Q8H.
   - continue dosing antibiotics to creatinine clearance of zero.
   - continue monitoring urine output.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
   [**Last Name (un) 303**] note on [**1-5**] said insulin resistance due to acidosis/infection
   counter regulatory effects.  Recommended increasing insulin drip until
   glucose within 140-180 range.
   - Insulin 100 Units/100 ml NS @ 0.5-60 units/hr IV. Fingersticks every
   hour.
 RHABDO
 Patient
s CK rising likely a result of global low grade
   rhabdomyolysis. CK appears to be leveling off.
   - continue to increase urine flow with pressors.  Once pressors are
   weaned, consider starting low dose IV lasix.
   - continue to follow CK.
 ANEMIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA
s hematocrit and plts dropping.  DIC
   labs were negative (no DIC), RBC morphology was normal (no TTP).
   - continue blood transfusions to keep HCT> 21.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Continue tube feeds.
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale, Insulin infusion
   restarted.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). He has been intubated due to aspiration and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Currently, he is experiencing sepsis, renal failure, and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. His weight is currently 49.2 kg, with a height of 56 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 36 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.6 mg/dL, glucose of 186 mg/dL, and lactic acid levels of 3.4 mmol/L. The basic coagulation panel indicates a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and a slightly elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of diabetes, and his current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, shock, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, but his blood cultures have been negative. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving insulin through a sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to the underlying infection and potential development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, possibly due to sepsis or rhabdomyolysis. This condition can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not managed with appropriate insulin therapy.

4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which may be related to antibiotic use or an underlying infection. It is important to monitor fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37 kg, 56-inch tall female with a current weight of 46.3 kg. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure in the 80s/40s mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on insulin therapy.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been unstable. She was taken off insulin gtt and started on Lantus and sliding scale. Initially, she did well on trial PSV (pressure support ventilation) throughout the day, but then became fatigued and was placed back on assist-control mode. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s, and Levo was restarted. High residuals of 250 mL were observed, and Reglan was started standing.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies

Medications:
- Insulin Lantus qhs
- Sliding scale insulin
- Pantoprazole (Protonix)

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with symptoms of shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, mixed acidosis, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89-91/44-54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated troponin-T levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia and hypokalemia. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, mixed acidosis, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia. The plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, optimizing fluid balance, managing hyperglycemia, treating renal failure, and addressing other comorbidities."

   Imaging: Final Report
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH
   INDICATION: Evaluation for interval placement.
   COMPARISON: [**1-6**].
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a left central venous
   access line has been inserted. The course of the line is unremarkable.
   The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.
   The ventilation of the right lung has overall slightly improved.
   Otherwise,
   the radiograph is unchanged. The pre-existing retrocardiac opacities,
   including some air bronchograms, are better visible than on the
   previous
   examination.

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient is now intubated and on pressors. 

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock, other: The patient is clinically appearing septic and severely hypovolemic due to osmotic diuresis.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has hypoventilation, chronic CO2 retention, and is unable to ventilate in the setting of metabolic acidosis.
3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient suspects ATN from poor perfusion.
4. Acidosis, mixed: The patient has NG metabolic, hyperchloremic, and respiratory acidosis, likely chronic, small AG metabolic acidosis (corrected for albumin AG=16).
5. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has CXR and CT documented.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose balance requires dextrose infusions.
7. Abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness): The patient has abdominal distention.
8. Thrombocytopenia, acute: The patient has DIC labs negative, holding heparin SC.

   Imaging: Final Report
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH
   INDICATION: Evaluation for interval placement.
   COMPARISON: [**1-6**].
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a left central venous
   access line has been inserted. The course of the line is unremarkable.
   The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.
   The ventilation of the right lung has overall slightly improved.
   Otherwise,
   the radiograph is unchanged. The pre-existing retrocardiac opacities,
   including some air bronchograms, are better visible than on the
   previous
   examination.

   Imaging: Final Report
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH
   INDICATION: Evaluation for interval placement.
   COMPARISON: [**1-6**].
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a left central venous
   access line has been inserted. The course of the line is unremarkable.
   The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.
   The ventilation of the right lung has overall slightly improved.
   Otherwise,
   the radiograph is unchanged. The pre-existing retrocardiac opacities,
   including some air bronchograms, are better visible than on the
   previous
   examination.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, OTHER - still on broad spectrum antibiotics, also severely
   hypovolemic [**1-4**] osmotic diuresis. Exact cause of hypotension uncertain.
   - continue phenylephrine to maintain MAP>65
   - continue antibiotics (vanc, cipro, pipercillin/tazobactam=zosyn)
   considering respiratory findings.  Will d/c antibiotics tomorrow if
   cultures remain negative because pt will have completed 8 day course
   for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - Abx course clarified:
   Day 1 vancomycin [**1-4**] 1gm IV Q12H later changed to 0.75gm IV Q12H,
   Day 1 ciprofloxacin [**1-4**] 400mg IV Q12, then changed to Q24
   Day 1 piperacillin-tazobactam [**1-4**] 2.25 g IV Q6H
   Day 1 fluconazole [**1-5**] 200 mg IV Q24H
   - continue fluconazole
   - check vanc trough
   - TTEcho to check for possible vegetations
   - f/u cultures
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Patient tolerated about 6 hourse of
   pressure support on [**6-7**] and 3 hours on [**6-8**].
   - Pressure support trial today. Try P=20, PEEP=5.
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Suspect ATN from
   poor perfusion. Urine output strong.
   - Continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - Continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from hypoventilation)
   and now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic
   acidosis). Bicarb now 15 (low).  To increase this and counteract
   acidosis, plan to cause contraction alkalosis (i.e. lasix -> renal
   perfusion down -> RAA system up -> [**Male First Name (un) **] causes K+ and H+ to be lost).
   Without so much acid on board, patient
s ventilation needs will be
   decreased and weaning from ventilator will be easier.
   - lasix 10mg IV.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 Sodium rose today to 153 despite free
   H20 via OG tube.
   - increase free H2O flushes to 150ml Q6H.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose.
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 abdominal
   distention/firmness appears to be resolving.  Belly noticably softer
   today. CK resolving.
   - continue to monitor abd exams and daily CK.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE- DIC labs negative, smear normal. Platelets
   rising to 116 today
   - continue to monitor.

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy and microcephaly admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. He developed aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient is now intubated and on pressors.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 124/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient's weight is 46.3 kg, and height is 56 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, lactate, amylase, lipase, troponin-T, and creatinine. The patient's glucose levels are elevated but decreasing. The patient's sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are also elevated. The patient's arterial blood gas values indicate a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's abdominal pain and distention appear to be resolving, but he still has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 36. The patient's renal function is impaired with an increased creatinine level.

The patient's imaging results show a left central venous access line with the tip projecting over the lower superior vena cava. There are retrocard"

   Imaging: Final Report
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH
   INDICATION: Evaluation for interval placement.
   COMPARISON: [**1-6**].
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a left central venous
   access line has been inserted. The course of the line is unremarkable.
   The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.
   The ventilation of the right lung has overall slightly improved.
   Otherwise,
   the radiograph is unchanged. The pre-existing retrocardiac opacities,
   including some air bronchograms, are better visible than on the
   previous
   examination.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. He developed aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient is now intubated and on pressors.

24-hour events include:
- Sputum culture and stool culture pending
- MAPs drifting down, requiring more neoroleading to switching to levophed and then back to neo
- Random cortisol level was 19, which is too low for the patient requiring 2 pressors
- Restarted heparin subcutaneously at a lower dose but discontinued due to platelets <50
- Antibiotic course clarified, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam
- Allergies: No known drug allergies
- Last dose of antibiotics: Fluconazole at [**2107-1-9**] 08:29 AM, ciprofloxacin at [**2107-1-9**] 11:46 AM, and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) at [**2107-1-10**] 01:31 AM

Infusions:
- Phenylephrine at 1 mcg/kg/min
- Other ICU medications: Pantoprazole (Protonix) at [**2107-1-9**] 08:14 PM

Lab results show:
- WBC: 7.2 - 8.8 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 23.6 - 26.9
- Platelets: 36 - 116 K/uL
- Creatinine: 2.4 - 2.7 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 64 - 198 mg/dL
- Sodium: 117 - 153 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.0 - 5.9 mEq/L
- HCO3: 15 - 26 mEq/L
- Base excess: -8 to -18
- Lactate: 1.7 mmol/L
- Amylase: 10 - 453 IU/L
- Lipase: 10 - 589 IU/L
- LDH: 453 - 8391 IU/L
- Calcium: 7.4 - 9.0 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.1 - 2.5 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.2 - 4.9 mg/dL

Imaging findings:
- Chest radiograph shows a left central venous access line with the tip projecting over the lower superior vena cava (SVC). There are also retrocardiac opacities with air bronchograms.
- Nasogastric tube terminating within the stomach.

Assessment and Plan:
- Shock: Still on broad-spectrum antibiotics, severely hypovolemic with ongoing osmotic diuresis.
- Continue phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
- Respiratory failure: Patient tolerated pressure support for a few hours.
- Renal failure: Suspect acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from poor perfusion.
- Acidosis: Slowly resolving.
- Hyperglycemia: Resolving, now on insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose.
- Abdominal pain: Resolving, with softer abdomen.
- Thrombocytopenia: Platelets rising, DIC labs negative, smear normal.
- Hypernatremia: Normalizing.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and communication with parents. Code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Imaging: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters
   of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, OTHER - Exact cause of hypotension still uncertain. Cultures
   remain negative and patient is on day 8 of abx.  TTE yesterday was
   negative.
   - continue phenylephrine to maintain MAP>65
   - discontinue antibiotics (vanc, cipro, pipercillin/tazobactam=zosyn).
   Day 1 vancomycin [**1-4**] 1gm IV Q12H later changed to 0.75gm IV Q12H,
   Day 1 ciprofloxacin [**1-4**] 400mg IV Q12, then changed to Q24
   Day 1 piperacillin-tazobactam [**1-4**] 2.25 g IV Q6H
   - continue fluconazole fluconazole (day 1 = [**2107-1-5**]) 200 mg IV Q24H
   - check vanc trough
   - f/u cultures
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Patient tolerated about 6 hours of
   pressure support on [**1-8**] and 3 hours on [**1-9**].5 hours on [**1-10**]. Plan for
   slow wean as we remove volume and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation
   for chronic respiratory hypercarbia.
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=20, PEEP=5.
   - wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - continue diuresis (as below)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Suspect ATN from
   poor perfusion. Urine output strong.
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from hypoventilation)
   and now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic
   acidosis). Bicarb now 15 (low).  To increase this and counteract
   acidosis, plan to cause contraction alkalosis (i.e. lasix -> renal
   perfusion down -> RAA system up -> [**Male First Name (un) **] causes K+ and H+ to be lost).
   Without so much acid on board, patient
s ventilation needs will be
   decreased and weaning from ventilator will be easier.
   - lasix 10mg IV goal net output of 0.5 liters.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium down today to 150 from 153.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 150ml Q4H.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose.
 RHABDO
 abdomen continues to be soft like yesterday.
   - continue to monitor abd exams and daily CK.
   - repeat CK measurement today.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE - HCT to 26.5 today. Platelets rising to 205
   today
   - continue to monitor HCT and platelets.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). After aspiration, the patient developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and shock. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. The plan is to wean the ventilator slowly as the patient tolerates it.

2. Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,666 mL of fluids since admission. The urine output is being monitored, and diuresis is ongoing with a goal of -500 ml.

3. Blood glucose levels: The patient's blood glucose is being controlled with insulin sliding scale and Lantus insulin. Dextrose infusions are given for hypoglycemia.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium) and is receiving free water flushes to correct it. The potassium levels are being monitored and repleted as needed.

5. Acidosis: The patient has mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. To counteract this, Lasix is being given to cause contraction alkalosis.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing, and close monitoring of hematocrit and platelets is ongoing.

7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's abdomen is soft, and there"

   Imaging: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters
   of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Imaging: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters
   of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

 SHOCK, OTHER - Exact cause of hypotension still uncertain. Cultures
   remain negative and patient is on day 8 of abx.  TTE yesterday was
   negative. Temperature rose to 99 overnight and remains so. Pt is tachy
   overnight.
   - repeat BCx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - get official ID consult on patients infection possibilities.
   - continue antibiotics pending ID suggestions (vanc, cipro,
   pipercillin/tazobactam=zosyn).
   Day 1 vancomycin [**1-4**] 1gm IV Q12H later changed to 0.75gm IV Q12H,
   Day 1 ciprofloxacin [**1-4**] 400mg IV Q12, then changed to Q24
   Day 1 piperacillin-tazobactam [**1-4**] 2.25 g IV Q6H
   - change fluconazole to mycofungin (need ID approval)
   - check vanc trough
   - f/u cultures
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Patient tolerated about 6 hours of
   pressure support on [**1-8**] and 3 hours on [**1-9**].5 hours on [**1-10**]. Plan for
   slow wean as we remove volume and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation
   for chronic respiratory hypercarbia.
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16, PEEP=5.
   - wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - continue diuresis (as below)
   - decrease patient
s home dose of valium to 6mg [**Hospital1 7**] to promote
   ventilation.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Suspect ATN from
   poor perfusion. Urine output strong.
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from hypoventilation)
   and now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic
   acidosis). Bicarb now 15 (low).  To increase this and counteract
   acidosis, plan to cause contraction alkalosis (i.e. lasix -> renal
   perfusion down -> RAA system up -> [**Male First Name (un) **] causes K+ and H+ to be lost).
   Without so much acid on board, patient
s ventilation needs will be
   decreased and weaning from ventilator will be easier.  HCO3 needs to
   rise to about 30 in order to extubated.
   - start lasix drip @1mg/hr.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium down today to 150 from 153.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 150ml Q4H.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). The patient developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications, including antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure and is on pressure support and assist-control ventilation. There is a plan for slow weaning as the patient tolerates it. The main concern is promoting ventilation and preventing further respiratory compromise.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor perfusion. Urine output is strong, indicating some level of renal function, but ongoing monitoring of I/O and daily electrolytes is necessary. Maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 is crucial to support renal perfusion.

3. Mixed Acidosis: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis from hypoventilation and anion gap metabolic acidosis from DKA, uremia, and lactic acidosis. Bicarbonate levels are low, and there is a plan to cause contraction alkalosis by administering Lasix to promote potassium and hydrogen ion loss. This will help counteract the acidosis and facilitate weaning from the ventilator.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially high but have been brought down"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently developed respiratory failure, renal failure, metabolic acidemia, and shock. The patient is now intubated.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's urine output has been good, and they have been receiving lasix gtt (furosemide infusion). The patient's ID recommendations resulted in the discontinuation of Zosyn/ciprofloxacin, which was completed. A repeat CT scan of the sinuses and chest has not been done yet. With ID approval, micafungin was started. The patient was given Tylenol overnight for temperature and pain control.

The patient has a history of drug allergies, including Name2 (not specified). The last doses of antibiotics administered were fluconazole, micafungin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/68 mmHg to 80/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal"

 SHOCK, OTHER - Exact cause of hypotension still uncertain. Cultures
   remain negative.  TTE was negative. Temperature rose to 99 overnight
   and remains so. Pt is tachy overnight. Stopping antibiotics will help
   with I/Os.
   - followup repeat BCx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - appreciate ID consult on patients infection possibilities
   - followup repeat chest and sinus CT today
   - discontinue antibiotics per ID suggestions
   - continue micafungin
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 7 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16, PEEP=5.
   - wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - continue diuresis (as below)
   - decrease patient
s home dose of valium to 6mg [**Hospital1 7**] to promote
   ventilation.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Suspect ATN from
   poor perfusion. Urine output strong.
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from restriction) and
   now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic acidosis).
   Bicarb now .  To increase this and counteract acidosis, plan to cause
   contraction alkalosis (i.e. lasix -> renal perfusion down -> RAA system
   up -> [**Male First Name (un) **] causes K+ and H+ to be lost).  Without so much acid on
   board, patient
s ventilation needs will be decreased and weaning from
   ventilator will be easier.  HCO3 needs to rise to about 30 in order to
   extubated.
   - continue lasix drip @3mg/hr.
   - continue daily lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 150
   - continue free H2O flushes to 150ml Q4H.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose.
 RHABDO
 abdomen continues to be soft like yesterday. Resolving
   - continue to monitor abd exams and daily CK.
   - repeat CK measurement daily.

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Respiratory failure, intubation.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2107-1-8**].
    There is no significant change in the right mid and lower lung opacity
   involving almost the entire area of that lung with some sparing of the
   right
   upper lobe. The left lung is essentially clear. The left retrocardiac
   opacity is unchanged as well as there is no change in the
   cardiomediastinal
   contour and orthopedic hardware. The ET tube tip cannot be seen. The NG
   tube
   tip is in the stomach.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, OTHER - Exact cause of hypotension still uncertain. Cultures
   remain negative.  TTE was negative. Temperature rose to 99 overnight
   and remains so. Pt is tachy overnight. Stopping antibiotics will help
   with I/Os.
   - followup repeat BCx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - appreciate ID consult on patients infection possibilities
   - followup repeat chest and sinus CT today
   - discontinue antibiotics per ID suggestions
   - continue micafungin
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 7 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16, PEEP=5.
   - wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - continue diuresis (as below)
   - decrease patient
s home dose of valium to 6mg [**Hospital1 7**] to promote
   ventilation.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Suspect ATN from
   poor perfusion. Urine output strong.
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from restriction) and
   now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic acidosis).
   Bicarb now .  To increase this and counteract acidosis, plan to cause
   contraction alkalosis (i.e. lasix -> renal perfusion down -> RAA system
   up -> [**Male First Name (un) **] causes K+ and H+ to be lost).  Without so much acid on
   board, patient
s ventilation needs will be decreased and weaning from
   ventilator will be easier.  HCO3 needs to rise to about 30 in order to
   extubated.
   - continue lasix drip @3mg/hr.
   - continue daily lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 150
   - continue free H2O flushes to 150ml Q4H.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose.
 RHABDO
 abdomen continues to be soft like yesterday. Resolving
   - continue to monitor abd exams and daily CK.
   - repeat CK measurement daily.

   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Respiratory failure, intubation.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2107-1-8**].
    There is no significant change in the right mid and lower lung opacity
   involving almost the entire area of that lung with some sparing of the
   right
   upper lobe. The left lung is essentially clear. The left retrocardiac
   opacity is unchanged as well as there is no change in the
   cardiomediastinal
   contour and orthopedic hardware. The ET tube tip cannot be seen. The NG
   tube
   tip is in the stomach.

   - followup read on today
s chest and sinus CT
   - appreciate ID consult on patients infection possibilities
   - discontinue antibiotics (vanc, cipro, zosyn) per ID suggestions
   - continue micafungin
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 7 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
   - continue diuresis (as below)
   - decrease patient
s home dose of valium to 4mg [**Hospital1 7**] to promote
   ventilation (decreased to 6mg [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday).
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output
   strong.
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from restriction) and
   now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic acidosis).
   Bicarb now .  To increase this and counteract acidosis, plan to cause
   contraction alkalosis (i.e. lasix -> renal perfusion down -> RAA system
   up -> [**Male First Name (un) **] causes K+ and H+ to be lost).  Without so much acid on
   board, patient
s ventilation needs will be decreased and weaning from
   ventilator will be easier.  HCO3 needs to rise to about 30 in order to

   - continue lasix drip @3mg/hr.
   - continue daily lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 154,
   indicating loss of free H20 from intubation.
   - increase free H2O flushes to 200ml Q4H

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. He aspirated, developed respiratory failure, renal failure, metabolic acidemia, and shock. The patient is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of allergies to certain medications and has received various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and antifungal medication. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 127/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 37 kg at admission to 46.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,096 mL and output of 3,150 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with positive pressure ventilation set at 280 mL tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O. The patient is receiving lasix at a rate of 3 mg/hour and micafungin as per ID approval. Blood cultures remain negative, and imaging shows no significant change in right lung opacity involving almost the entire area of that lung with some sparing of the right upper lobe.

   CXR [**1-12**]
   Final Report
   SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
   REASON FOR EXAM: Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Patient
   with a history of cerebral palsy.
   Comparison is made with the prior study, [**2107-1-11**].
   Extense right lung opacities have improved. Left perihilar opacities
   have
   improved. All those are consistent with patient's history of
   aspiration.
   Small left pleural effusion has improved. Cardiac size is normal. Left
   lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has improved. The apices of the lungs
   cannot be evaluated. The chin obscures them. ET tube cannot be
   assessed. Left central
   catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction or in the proximal right
   atrium.
   NG tube tip is in the stomach.
   A spinal hardware is present.

   Ct chest/abdomen/pelvis [**1-12**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Improved aeration with decreased but persistent areas of ill-defined
   consolidation and peribronchovascular ground glass and nodular
   opacities
   within the right lung, compatible with aspiration pneumonia. Left lung
   base
   consolidation is significantly improved. An area of ground-glass
   opacity is
   present in the left upper lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions with
   compressive atelectasis persist, with significant interval improvement
   on the
   left.
   2. Simple fluid within the abdomen and pelvis likely result from large
   volume
   fluid resuscitation in the setting of hypovolemia. No loculated fluid
   collection or abscess formation within the abdomen and pelvis.
   3. Unchanged focal fatty infiltration within right lobe of liver.
   4. Limited assessment of intestines without oral or intravenous

   Assessment and plan
 FEVER AND TACHYCARDIA - Temperature at 99F and pt is tachy.
   Infection is a likely explanation. However, ultures remain negative and
   CT scans show no obvious source of infection aside from potentially
   lungs.  Left IJ line also suspected. Pt back on andtibiotics including
   micafungin. Pt off pressors currently.  Other potential causes of
   tachycardia include pain/agitation.
   Pt tachycardic with fever up to 100.6 overnight.
   - restart vancomycin to level and continue micafungin
   - followup all blood, urine, sputum
   - repeat micafungin today
   - followup read on sinus CT
   - restart patient
s home dose of valium to treat possible agitation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 7 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
   - continue gentle diuresis (as below)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output strong
   and creatinine resolving
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from restriction) and
   now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic acidosis).
   Bicarb now 20.  To increase this and counteract acidosis, plan to cause
   contraction. HCO3 needs to rise to about 30 in order to extubated.
   - continue lasix drip @1 mg/hr.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 152 down from
   154 yesterday, indicating loss of free H20 from intubation. Pharm
   contact[**Name (NI) **] to limit [**Name (NI) **] exposure.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 200ml Q4H
   - follow Na
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
 RHABDO
 abdomen continues to be soft like yesterday. Resolving with
   CK 291 today.
   - continue to monitor
 ANEMIA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. He developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and apparent septic shock after aspiration in the unit. The patient is now intubated and on assisted ventilation.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has had a fever with a temperature of 100.6 and has been tachycardic. Cultures have been drawn from the central venous line, urine, and sputum. The patient's sodium levels have decreased from 154 to 152, indicating loss of free water from intubation. The patient is on a free water flush of 200 mL every 4 hours.

The patient's respiratory support has been adjusted multiple times, with the current settings at a tidal volume of 280 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 23, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's renal function is improving, with an increased urine output and decreasing creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are resolving, and he has been taken off the insulin infusion."

   Final Report
   SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
   REASON FOR EXAM: Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Patient
   with a history of cerebral palsy.
   Comparison is made with the prior study, [**2107-1-11**].
   Extense right lung opacities have improved. Left perihilar opacities
   have
   improved. All those are consistent with patient's history of
   aspiration.
   Small left pleural effusion has improved. Cardiac size is normal. Left
   lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has improved. The apices of the lungs
   cannot be evaluated. The chin obscures them. ET tube cannot be
   assessed. Left central
   catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction or in the proximal right
   atrium.
   NG tube tip is in the stomach.
   A spinal hardware is present.

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Improved aeration with decreased but persistent areas of ill-defined
   consolidation and peribronchovascular ground glass and nodular
   opacities
   within the right lung, compatible with aspiration pneumonia. Left lung
   base
   consolidation is significantly improved. An area of ground-glass
   opacity is
   present in the left upper lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions with
   compressive atelectasis persist, with significant interval improvement
   on the
   left.
   2. Simple fluid within the abdomen and pelvis likely result from large
   volume
   fluid resuscitation in the setting of hypovolemia. No loculated fluid
   collection or abscess formation within the abdomen and pelvis.
   3. Unchanged focal fatty infiltration within right lobe of liver.
   4. Limited assessment of intestines without oral or intravenous
   contrast. No dilated loops.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). The patient developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and apparent septic shock after aspiration in the unit. He is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes a history of cerebral palsy, allergies to certain medications, and previous infections. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, antifungal medications, and blood product transfusions.

The patient's current vital signs show a fever, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's weight has increased from 37 kg at admission to 43.5 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia and hyperglycemia.

Radiological imaging reveals findings consistent with aspiration pneumonia, with areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in the right lung, as well as a small left pleural effusion. The abdominal and pelvic CT scan shows simple fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, likely due to large volume fluid resuscitation.

Microbiology cultures are pending for blood, urine, stool, and sputum samples. The patient is currently on broad"

   Final Report
   SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
   REASON FOR EXAM: Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Patient
   with a history of cerebral palsy.
   Comparison is made with the prior study, [**2107-1-11**].
   Extense right lung opacities have improved. Left perihilar opacities
   have
   improved. All those are consistent with patient's history of
   aspiration.
   Small left pleural effusion has improved. Cardiac size is normal. Left
   lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has improved. The apices of the lungs
   cannot be evaluated. The chin obscures them. ET tube cannot be
   assessed. Left central
   catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction or in the proximal right
   atrium.
   NG tube tip is in the stomach.
   A spinal hardware is present.

   Ct chest/abdomen/pelvis [**1-12**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Improved aeration with decreased but persistent areas of ill-defined
   consolidation and peribronchovascular ground glass and nodular
   opacities
   within the right lung, compatible with aspiration pneumonia. Left lung
   base
   consolidation is significantly improved. An area of ground-glass
   opacity is
   present in the left upper lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions with
   compressive atelectasis persist, with significant interval improvement
   on the
   left.
   2. Simple fluid within the abdomen and pelvis likely result from large
   volume
   fluid resuscitation in the setting of hypovolemia. No loculated fluid
   collection or abscess formation within the abdomen and pelvis.
   3. Unchanged focal fatty infiltration within right lobe of liver.
   4. Limited assessment of intestines without oral or intravenous
   contrast. No dilated loops.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). The patient developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and apparent septic shock after aspiration in the unit. He is now intubated.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but he remains clinically appearing septic. He is also severely hypovolemic due to osmotic diuresis. The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypoventilation, chronic CO2 retention, and an inability to ventilate in the setting of metabolic acidosis. He also has acute renal failure, suspected to be caused by acute tubular necrosis from poor perfusion.

The patient's mixed acidosis is likely a combination of metabolic acidosis from NG tube aspiration and respiratory acidosis from chronic CO2 retention. The patient has hyperglycemia requiring dextrose infusions, abdominal pain with distention, and acute thrombocytopenia. His sodium levels are high but normalizing.

The patient is being managed in the ICU with appropriate interventions such as glycemic control, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's code status is set as DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition remains in the ICU."

   Final Report
   SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
   REASON FOR EXAM: Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Patient
   with a history of cerebral palsy.
   Comparison is made with the prior study, [**2107-1-11**].
   Extense right lung opacities have improved. Left perihilar opacities
   have
   improved. All those are consistent with patient's history of
   aspiration.
   Small left pleural effusion has improved. Cardiac size is normal. Left
   lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has improved. The apices of the lungs
   cannot be evaluated. The chin obscures them. ET tube cannot be
   assessed. Left central
   catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction or in the proximal right
   atrium.
   NG tube tip is in the stomach.
   A spinal hardware is present.

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Improved aeration with decreased but persistent areas of ill-defined
   consolidation and peribronchovascular ground glass and nodular
   opacities
   within the right lung, compatible with aspiration pneumonia. Left lung
   base
   consolidation is significantly improved. An area of ground-glass
   opacity is
   present in the left upper lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions with
   compressive atelectasis persist, with significant interval improvement
   on the
   left.
   2. Simple fluid within the abdomen and pelvis likely result from large
   volume
   fluid resuscitation in the setting of hypovolemia. No loculated fluid
   collection or abscess formation within the abdomen and pelvis.
   3. Unchanged focal fatty infiltration within right lobe of liver.
   4. Limited assessment of intestines without oral or intravenous
   contrast. No dilated loops.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Assessment and plan
 SHOCK, OTHER - Exact cause of hypotension still uncertain. Cultures
   remain negative. CT scans show no obvious source of infection aside
   from potentially lungs. Temperature at 99F. Pt is tachy. Pt off
   andtibiotics except micafungin. Pt off pressors currently.
   Pt tachycardic with fever up to 100.6 overnight.
   - followup all BCx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - repeat micafungin today
   - followup read on sinus CT
   - appreciate ID consult on patients infection possibilities
   - continue micafungin
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 7 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
   - continue gentle diuresis (as below)
   - keep patient
s home dose of valium to 4mg [**Hospital1 7**] to promote ventilation
   (decreased to 6mg [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday).
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output
   strong.
   - continue monitoring I/O and daily lytes
   - continue maintaining MAP>65
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic resp acidosis (from restriction) and
   now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia, Lactic acidosis).
   Bicarb now 20.  To increase this and counteract acidosis, plan to cause
   contraction. HCO3 needs to rise to about 30 in order to extubated.
   - continue lasix drip @1 mg/hr.
   - continue daily lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 152 down from
   154 yesterday, indicating loss of free H20 from intubation. Pharm
   contact[**Name (NI) **] to limit [**Name (NI) **] exposure.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 200ml Q4H
   - follow Na
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving. Pt off gtt given stable FS.  Now on
   insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus. Dextrose infusions
   for hypoglycemia.

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). The patient developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and apparent septic shock after aspiration in the unit. He is now intubated.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. Blood cultures were taken from the central venous line (CVL) at various times. Urine and sputum cultures were also obtained. The patient's vital signs have been recorded, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, with a tidal volume of 280 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and lactic acid levels. The blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensation and metabolic acidosis. Renal function tests reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and total bilirubin (Tot Bili) levels. The electrolyte levels are abnormal, with"

   CXR [**1-12**]
   Final Report
   SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
   REASON FOR EXAM: Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Patient
   with a history of cerebral palsy.
   Comparison is made with the prior study, [**2107-1-11**].
   Extense right lung opacities have improved. Left perihilar opacities
   have
   improved. All those are consistent with patient's history of
   aspiration.
   Small left pleural effusion has improved. Cardiac size is normal. Left
   lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has improved. The apices of the lungs
   cannot be evaluated. The chin obscures them. ET tube cannot be
   assessed. Left central
   catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction or in the proximal right
   atrium.
   NG tube tip is in the stomach.
   A spinal hardware is present.

   Ct chest/abdomen/pelvis [**1-12**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Improved aeration with decreased but persistent areas of ill-defined
   consolidation and peribronchovascular ground glass and nodular
   opacities
   within the right lung, compatible with aspiration pneumonia. Left lung
   base
   consolidation is significantly improved. An area of ground-glass
   opacity is
   present in the left upper lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions with
   compressive atelectasis persist, with significant interval improvement
   on the
   left.
   2. Simple fluid within the abdomen and pelvis likely result from large
   volume
   fluid resuscitation in the setting of hypovolemia. No loculated fluid
   collection or abscess formation within the abdomen and pelvis.
   3. Unchanged focal fatty infiltration within right lobe of liver.
   4. Limited assessment of intestines without oral or intravenous
   contrast. No dilated loops.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Assessment and plan
 SHOCK, OTHER - Exact cause of hypotension still uncertain. Cultures
   remain negative. CT scans show no obvious source of infection aside
   from potentially lungs. Temperature at 99F. Pt is tachy. Pt off
   andtibiotics except micafungin. Pt off pressors currently.
   Pt tachycardic with fever up to 100.6 overnight.
   - followup all BCx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - repeat micafungin today
   - followup read on sinus CT
   - appreciate ID consult on patients infection possibilities
   - continue micafungin
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 7 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
   - continue gentle diuresis (as below)
   - keep patient
s home dose of valium to 4mg [**Hospital1 7**] to promote ventilation
   (decreased to 6mg [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday).
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output
   strong.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and apparent septic shock after aspiration in the unit. The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient's respiratory failure is due to aspiration pneumonia and chronic respiratory hypercarbia. The plan is to slowly wean off the ventilator as volume and bicarbonate levels are adjusted to compensate for the chronic respiratory acidosis.
2. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to DKA, uremia, and lactic acidosis. Daily monitoring of intake/output and electrolytes is ongoing, and efforts are being made to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
3. Acidosis, Mixed: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis from restriction and anion gap metabolic acidosis from DKA, uremia, and lactic acidosis. Bicarbonate levels need to rise to about 30 to allow for extubation.
4. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's sodium levels remain high, indicating loss of free water from intubation. Free water flushes are being continued to 200 mL every four hours.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are resolving, and he"

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, TACHYCARDIA, Leukocytosis - Temperature at 99.1F and pt is
   tachycardic in low 100s. WBC today is down to 12.5. Infection is a
   likely explanation. However, cultures remain negative and CT scans show
   no obvious source of infection aside from potentially lungs.  Left IJ
   line suspected source.  IO device site was soft, nonerythematous, and
   not indurated.
   Per ID recs, pt back on antibiotics
 vancomycin, flagyl, cefepime, and
   micafungin.  Other potential cause of tachycardia includes
   pain/agitation.
   - continue vanc, flagyl, cefepime, and micafungin
   - followup all blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - followup B Glucan result
   - continue to hold diuresis
   - consult IR today for more access
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 10 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output strong
   and creatinine resolving
 down to 2.0.
   - continue monitoring I/O and [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - continue to hold diuresis because of fever
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic respiratory acidosis (from
   restriction) and now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia,
   Lactic acidosis). Bicarb now up to 22 after diuresis. HCO3 needs to
   rise to about 30 in order to extubated.
   However, patient with a net gain of 437ml since midnight now that
   diuresis has been stopped.
   - continue holding lasix drip.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 150 down from
   152 yesterday.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 200ml Q4H
   - follow Na
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving with glucose today at 110. Pt off gtt given
   stable FS.  Now on insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus.
   Dextrose infusions for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
 ANEMIA
 HCT up slightly to 24.4 today.  Haptoglobin yesterday
   normal.

","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). The patient has since developed shock, respiratory failure, and renal failure. Currently, the patient is intubated, off pressors, and has a fever and tachycardia.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to certain medications and previous doses of antibiotics, such as fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), micafungin, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/73 to 128/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is within normal range, but there are abnormalities in kidney function and electrolyte levels, including high sodium and potassium levels. Other lab results indicate possible infection, but cultures remain negative.

Imaging studies reveal no obvious source of infection aside from potentially the lungs. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the administration of antibiotics, diuresis, and"

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, TACHYCARDIA, Leukocytosis - Temperature at 99.1F and pt is
   tachycardic in low 100s. WBC today is down to 12.5. Infection is a
   likely explanation. However, cultures remain negative and CT scans show
   no obvious source of infection aside from potentially lungs.  Left IJ
   line suspected source.  IO device site was soft, nonerythematous, and
   not indurated.
   Per ID recs, pt back on antibiotics
 vancomycin, flagyl, cefepime, and
   micafungin.  Other potential cause of tachycardia includes
   pain/agitation.
   - continue vanc, flagyl, cefepime, and micafungin
   - followup all blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - followup B Glucan result and aspergillus result
   - continue lasix at 3mg/hr
   - consult IR today for more access
   - order plain film and bone scan to check for osteomyelitis at IO
   device site (potential source of infection).  Also check orthopedic
   implants for signs of infection.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 10 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
   - CXR today to check for pneumothorax
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output strong
   and creatinine resolving
 down to 2.0.
   - continue monitoring I/O and [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - continue to hold diuresis because of fever
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic respiratory acidosis (from
   restriction) and now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia,
   Lactic acidosis). Bicarb now up to 22 after diuresis. HCO3 needs to
   rise to about 30 in order to extubated.
   However, patient with a net gain of 437ml since midnight now that
   diuresis has been stopped.
   - continue holding lasix drip.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 150 down from
   152 yesterday.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 200ml Q4H
   - follow Na
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving with glucose today at 110. Pt off gtt given
   stable FS.  Now on insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus.
   Dextrose infusions for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
 ANEMIA
 HCT up slightly to 24.4 today.  Haptoglobin yesterday
   normal.
   - continue to monitor HCT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 17-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is fever, and he has been experiencing hypotension, diarrhea, respiratory failure, renal failure, acidosis, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

24-hour events include nuclear medicine procedures, PICC line placement, culture samples taken, and changes in antibiotic therapy. The patient's vital signs are unstable with fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, abnormal kidney function, high glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is clinically appearing septic and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has severe hypovolemia due to osmotic diuresis. The patient's respiratory failure is hypoventilatory with chronic CO2 retention and unable to ventilate in the setting of metabolic acidosis. Acute renal failure is suspected due to poor perfusion, and mixed acidosis is present with NG metabolic, hyperchloremic, and respiratory components.

The patient has pneumonia aspiration documented on CXR and CT scan. Hyperglycemia requires dextrose infusions, and the patient has abdominal pain with distention. Thrombocytopenia is present, and DIC labs are negative. Hypernatrem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, and various other medical complications. The patient remains febrile, tachycardic, and leukocytic, suggesting ongoing infection. Other potential etiologies for the patient's symptoms include thrombotic phenomenon, malignancy, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications to address the infections and organ failures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest a possible ongoing infection leading to septic shock.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen if not adequately treated.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, requiring insulin therapy to control.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient has thrombocytopenia and is at risk for thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Malignancy: The patient's symptoms may indicate an underlying malignancy, which needs further investigation.
7. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates possible poor perfusion and the need"

   Assessment and Plan
   FEVER, TACHYCARDIA, Leukocytosis - Temperature at 99.1F and pt is
   tachycardic in low 100s. WBC today is down to 12.5. Infection is a
   likely explanation. However, cultures remain negative and CT scans show
   no obvious source of infection aside from potentially lungs.  Left IJ
   line suspected source.  IO device site was soft, nonerythematous, and
   not indurated.
   Per ID recs, pt back on antibiotics
 vancomycin, flagyl, cefepime, and
   micafungin.  Other potential cause of tachycardia includes
   pain/agitation.
   - continue vanc, flagyl, cefepime, and micafungin
   - followup all blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - followup B Glucan result and aspergillus result
   - continue lasix at 3mg/hr
   - consult IR today for more access
   - order plain film and bone scan to check for osteomyelitis at IO
   device site (potential source of infection).  Also check orthopedic
   implants for signs of infection.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Plan for slow wean as we remove volume
   and HCO3 to allow metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory
   hypercarbia. Patient completing daily pressure support trials
   (yesterday about 10 hours)
   - pressure support trial today. Try P=16 (wean by 2cm H2O per hour),
   PEEP=5.
   - CXR today to check for pneumothorax
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Urine output strong
   and creatinine resolving
 down to 2.0.
   - continue monitoring I/O and [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - continue to hold diuresis because of fever
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 pt has chronic respiratory acidosis (from
   restriction) and now anion gap metabolic acidosis (from DKA, Uremia,
   Lactic acidosis). Bicarb now up to 22 after diuresis. HCO3 needs to
   rise to about 30 in order to extubated.
   However, patient with a net gain of 437ml since midnight now that
   diuresis has been stopped.
   - continue holding lasix drip.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and VBGs.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 sodium continues today at 150 down from
   152 yesterday.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 200ml Q4H
   - follow Na
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 resolving with glucose today at 110. Pt off gtt given
   stable FS.  Now on insulin sliding scale plus fixed dose 15u lantus.
   Dextrose infusions for hypoglycemia.
   - continue to monitor glucose
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
 ANEMIA
 HCT up slightly to 24.4 today.  Haptoglobin yesterday
   normal.
   - continue to monitor HCT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and potential complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure: The patient was admitted with DKA and respiratory failure. The current vital signs show a temperature of 99.9°F (37.7°C), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 280 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance of 28 cmH2O/mL, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a mixed acidosis with a pH of 7.22. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off the ventilator gradually.

2. Infection: The patient has been febrile since January 11th, with temperatures ranging from 38.6°C to 101.4°F. Cultures have remained negative, and CT scans do not show any obvious source of infection. However, the left internal jugular (IJ) line is suspected to be the potential source of infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a non-verbal individual with a chief complaint of DKA and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone various interventions. The patient's fever persists, and cultures remain negative. The left IJ line is suspected as a potential source of infection. Antibiotics have been restarted, and further tests are pending. The patient also has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, mixed acidosis, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and anemia. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and appropriate treatments are being administered.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and negative cultures suggest a possible ongoing infection. The left IJ line could be a potential source of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and conducting appropriate cultures is important.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and gradual weaning off the ventilator will be necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Continuous monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
4. Mixed acidosis: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Managing bicarbonate levels and addressing underlying causes will be essential.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful management, including free water flushes and close monitoring.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's resolving"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), now with resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new fevers, and leukocytosis.

The patient has a history of being non-verbal, so obtaining a thorough medical history was not possible. He has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 01/13/2107 at 12:43 PM, cefepime on 01/14/2107 at 06:32 PM, and metronidazole on 01/15/2107 at 04:40 AM.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV. His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 99/55 mmHg to 124/72 mmHg, increased respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values such as blood glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), now with resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. He has worsening right-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, highly suspicious for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has worsening right-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are highly suspicious for new VAP. The presence of fevers and leukocytosis also suggests an infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been given, but the current antibiotic regimen may need to be adjusted based on culture results.
2. New onset of sepsis: The patient's new fevers and leukocytosis may indicate a new infection or progression of the current infection.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have improved from peak values in the mid-2s, but it is important to monitor renal function closely due to the previous acute kidney injury.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately with insulin therapy.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and free water boluses should be continued to correct this imbalance.
6. Anemia: The patient has received a blood transfusion, but further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the anemia. Guaiac stools should be checked, and the post-transfusion hemoglobin concentration should be assessed."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever, pneumonia, acute renal failure, diarrhea, and a rash. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 100.4°F, blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg, heart rate of 109 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and meropenem. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HONK). The patient now presents with resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new fevers, and leukocytosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further respiratory failure due to aspiration and VAP, sepsis secondary to VAP, worsening renal function, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, anemia, and stress ulcers.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), now with resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), likely secondary to aspiration. He is also experiencing respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period. Treatment includes antibiotics, and the patient's current antibiotic regimen has been changed to meropenem.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is initially thought to be due to aspiration but has now progressed to VAP. Continued treatment with antibiotics and diuretics will be necessary to manage this condition.
3. ARF: The patient's acute kidney injury is improving, with creatinine levels decreasing to 1.5 today. Diuretics will be continued to promote diuresis, and electrolyte levels will be monitored.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have been experiencing hypoxia and requiring increasing levels of respiratory support. The patient's sputum culture grew pseudomonas, leading to a change in antibiotic therapy from cefepime to meropenem. The patient has had intermittent fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection.

The patient's fluid balance shows a significant deficit, with more fluid being given than taken in. Their blood pressure has been stable but on the lower side, and they have had some fluctuations in heart rate. The patient's oxygen saturation has remained at 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and BUN, suggesting acute renal failure. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but electrolytes show hypernatremia, which is being addressed. The patient's glucose levels have been relatively stable, although there have been some fluctuations.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium. They are also receiving nutritional support through tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and chest x-rays will be important in identifying"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), now with resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 280 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. 

The patient's current medical conditions include fever, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and anemia. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and cefepime, and now meropenem has been added. The plan is to continue vancomycin with an increased dose to achieve a trough level of 15-20 mcg/mL. Micafungin will also be continued due to high glucan levels, with follow-up repeat glucan and galactomannan tests.

The potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to worsening right-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is also a concern for new-onset fevers and leukocytosis, which could indicate a new infection. Additionally, the patient's anemia requires"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Currently, he remains in respiratory failure with persistent ARDS and now has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 to 127/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 280 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 20.2% to 25.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 95 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 110-170 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) levels decreasing from a peak in the mid-2s to 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of recent blood transfusion. Allergies are not reported. The patient is on multiple medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, baclofen, miconazole powder, colace, reglan, micafungin, and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential need for tracheostomy or long-term ventilation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent development of VAP increases the risk of mortality and requires aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and respiratory support.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient was initially admitted with DKA, there is no mention of ongoing hyperglycemia or ketosis. Monitoring for any signs of DKA recurrence is essential.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent improvement in creatinine levels is a positive sign, but continued monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been controlled with insulin, but close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy are required to maintain euglycemia.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are elevated, indicating a risk for central pontine myelinolysis if not corrected carefully.

   Assessment and Plan
   25 y o man with microcephaly, CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HONK, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: initial macro-aspiration with likely resultant
   ARDS, then improved, and now with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum
   cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with PSA, developing intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, so now on meropenem. Tolerating PS 5/5 now.
   - continue on PS 5/5
   - continue to diurese: TBB goal
 500ccs
   - continue meropenem for PSA
   - extubate today vs. tomorrow
   2.  Fevers: no osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg,
   L IJ out yesterday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis
   and temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - D/c vancomycin
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan,
   galactomannan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.5 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP, tolerating
   Lasix gtt
   - TBB goal
 500 ccs/24 hours
   - check PM lytes
   4. Hyperglycemia: controlled on current lantus + ISS
   5. Hyperatremia: up again today to 153

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), now presenting with persistent respiratory failure. The patient has a history of macro-aspiration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which initially improved but now has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA). He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 280 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His respiratory system compliance is 25.5 cmH2O/mL, and his plateau pressure is 16 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 109 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.2 x 10^9/L, elevated hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.2 g/dL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) of 2.4 mg/dL. The patient has also shown improvement in lactic acid levels and fibrinogen levels. He has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and anemia, for which he received a blood transfusion yesterday. The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, with hyperglycemia controlled on current lantus + ISS, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia. The patient has a history of fevers without any positive blood cultures or osteomyelitis, but recent sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] have shown PSA sensitivity to meropenem. The patient is currently on meropenem, and his condition is improving. The patient has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) and is expected to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is a significant concern. The development of VAP due to PSA is a potential complication that needs to be addressed. The patient's current respiratory support and weaning process should be closely monitored.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient was initially admitted with DKA, his current glucose levels are within normal range. However, careful monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate AKI."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), and now has resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure/VAP, fevers, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, anemia, and cerebral palsy. 

For the respiratory failure/VAP, the patient is being treated with meropenem and is being considered for extubation. The plan is to continue meropenem and monitor for any signs of improvement.

The fevers are resolving, and all blood cultures are negative. The new PICC line has been placed, and glucan levels are being monitored due to an elevated beta glucan result. The plan is to continue micafungin and repeat the assays.

The ARF is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.3 today and good urine output. The diuresis will continue with a goal of 500 cc negative fluid output. The patient's electrolytes will be checked, and the diuresis will be continued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a non-verbal individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics such as cefepime, metronidazole, vancomycin, micafungin, and meropenem. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate between 101-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/48 to 113/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 37 kg at admission to 32.7 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3582 mL with outputs totaling 4700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1118 mL. The patient is on respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set Vt of 280 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 22 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O, compliance of 28 cmH2O/mL, and SpO2 of 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK). The patient is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. He had initial macro-aspiration with likely resultant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which improved, and now has likely new pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Sputum cultures from [Date range (1) 13319] showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn, so the patient is now on meropenem. The patient is tolerating pressure support (PS) again today, with slightly lower tidal volumes (VTs). 

The patient's fevers are improving with the addition of meropenem, and leukocytosis is present. Blood cultures are still negative, and the patient has had a line infection with a central line out yesterday and a new PICC line placed. The patient's creatinine (Cr) is down to 1.3 from a peak in the mid-2s, with good urine output (UOP) and tolerating Lasix gtt. The patient's blood glucose levels are controlled on current lantus + ISS. The patient's serum sodium levels are improving with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is 29 today,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and respiratory failure. The patient is non-verbal and unable to provide history. 

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and antifungal medications since admission. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 280 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever, hypotension, diarrhea, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and rash. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, worsening of renal function, sepsis, and potential infections due to immunosuppression. 

Further management should focus on optimizing respiratory support, monitoring fluid balance, managing electrolyte imbalances, and addressing any underlying infections or complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a non-verbal individual admitted to the ICU for DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes anemia, pneumonia, fever, hypotension, diarrhea, renal failure, hypernatremia, rash, and previous antibiotic use. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Fluid balance shows a net negative intake of 1 L, with total fluid input of 3,582 mL and total fluid output of 4,700 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Imaging shows a persistent right middle lung zone opacity and improved aeration at the right lung base. The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever, hypotension, diarrhea, acute renal failure, hypernatremia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple complications during his ICU stay, including macro-aspiration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fevers, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further ARDS or worsening of VAP. Monitoring vital signs, oxygen saturation, and chest X-ray results will be important in assessing this condition.
2. Pseudomonal VAP: The patient has developed a new pseudomonal VAP, which is a significant concern. Ensuring appropriate antibiotic therapy with meropenem and monitoring sputum cultures and sensitivity will be crucial.
3. Fevers: Despite negative blood cultures, the patient still has fevers. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying cause. Close monitoring of temperature trends and considering additional diagnostic tests such as bone scans or other imaging studies may be necessary.
4. ARF: The patient's renal function has improved, but ongoing monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output is essential to prevent further deterioration.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored,"

","The patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline, admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), now with persistent respiratory failure. The patient initially presented with macro-aspiration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), followed by improvement and subsequent development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) likely caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient has been treated with meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against Pseudomonas.

The patient also has fevers of unknown origin, with no evidence of osteomyelitis on x-ray/bone scan and negative blood cultures. The patient underwent placement of a new percutaneous internal jugular (LIJ) line and is now showing improvement in temperature and leukocyte count after the addition of meropenem.

Renal function has improved from acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level down to 1.3 from peak levels in the mid-2s. The patient is tolerating lasix infusion and has good urine output.

Hyperglycemia is controlled with lantus insulin plus short-acting insulin sensitivity (SSI). The patient's hypernatremia has improved with increased free water boluses. Anemia is likely due to phlebotomy, and the patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate response. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a non-verbal individual with a history of anemia, respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever, hypotension, diarrhea, renal failure, hypernatremia, and rash. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a set Vt of 280 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.29. The patient's physical examination findings are mostly not assessed. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures indicate a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation despite being on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation raise concerns for ARDS.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and fluid balance indicate a potential risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: initial macro-aspiration with likely resultant
   ARDS, then improved, and now with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum
   cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with PSA, developing intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, so now on meropenem. Tolerating PS trials.  WBC down to 8.3
   today.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation.
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue lasix drip at 2mg/hr with goal even to slightly neg (for to
   cause contraction alkalosis)
   - continue meropenem for PSA
   - consider extubation today of patient tolerating pressure support
   trial.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg, L IJ
   out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and
   temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending. Galactomannan negative.  D/ced vanco Sunday as no evidence of
   GP bacteria.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.3 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - TBB goal even to slightly neg
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: tube feeds Boost glucose control at 40mg/hr
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently developed multiorgan system failure, including respiratory, renal, and shock. The patient was intubated and placed on pressors. After completing a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains intubated but off pressors.

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, and cultures are pending. The patient's sputum culture has grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intermediate-sensitive to ceftazidime and cefepime, but sensitive to meropenem. The patient is currently on meropenem therapy.

The patient's respiratory failure initially resulted from macro-aspiration with likely resultant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), followed by improvement and now suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is tolerating pressure support trials and weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation. 

The patient's leukocyte count is down to 8.3 today, and the galactomannan test is negative. The glucan level is above 500, with repeats pending. The patient's creatinine level has decreased from mid-2s to 1.3 today, with good urine output (UOP).

The patient's hyperglycemia is well-controlled on current lantus + ISS. The"

The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently aspirated, leading to multi-organ system failure including respiratory, renal, and shock. The patient was intubated, placed on pressors, and received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Currently, the patient is still intubated but off pressors.

The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing fever, positive blood cultures, and respiratory infection. Imaging studies show no significant changes, except for a PICC line tip in the mid-to-lower portion of the superior vena cava (SVC). The patient has anemia, acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, fever, hypoventilation, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, diarrhea, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and rash.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the disposition is in the ICU."

   Final Report
   HISTORY: PICC line placement.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-16**], the left subclavian
   catheter appears to have been withdrawn somewhat with the tip now in
   the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change.
   DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   Approved: MON [**2107-1-17**] 10:10 AM
   CXR [**2107-1-16**]
   Final Report
   HISTORY: Assess for NG tube placement.
   NG tube is partially obscured by spinal rods. However, the tip overlies
   the
   distal stomach. If an ET tube is present, it is not well visualized on
   these films. a Left subclavian line is present -- the tip overlies the
   upper RA.
   The thoracic cavity is atypical in morphology, consistent with the
   provided clinical history. Allowing for overlying materials, there is
   faint patchy opacity in the right mid zone similar to that demonstrated
   on a [**2107-1-12**] CT scan and consistent with aspiration pneumonia. No new
   opacity is identified.
   No CHF or effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: Significantly improved after doing well with
   PSV trial all day yesterday however alarming to apnea yesterday ([**Last Name **]
   problem) and has been off sedation however getting boluses of fenanyl
   and midaz. Went back to AC for apnea. More alert, but still breathing
   at 14 now. Cause of respiratory failure was thought initially
   macro-aspiration with likely resultant ARDS, then improved, and now
   with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with
   pseudamonas, developing intermediate sensitivity to zosyn, so now on
   meropenem.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation.
   - Unlikely extubation today given apnea
   - consider mandatory minute ventilation
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue lasix drip at 2mg/hr with goal even
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas
   - ask ID whether would be worth double covering pt
s pseudomonas  given
   persistent positive sputum cultures
   - will clarify patient
s complicated abx history
   - DC vanc given no e/o gram positives in cultures
   - consider extubation today of patient tolerating pressure support
   trial.
   - d/w family re possible trach if no improvement
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg, L IJ
   out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and
   temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending. Galactomannan negative.  D/ced vanco Sunday as no evidence of
   GP bacteria.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan
   - obtain LENIs given fevers
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.2 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - TBB goal even to slightly neg
   - Monitor HCT
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: restart tube feeds Boost glucose control at 40mg/hr
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). The patient developed multiorgan system failure, including respiratory, renal, and shock. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, and the patient completed the course. Currently, the patient is still intubated but off pressors.

24-hour events include sputum culture, blood cultures from the peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line, and urine culture. The patient has had fevers ranging from 100.4 to 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's condition has been stable with some fluctuations in oxygen saturation levels and respiratory support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had macro-aspiration leading to aspiration pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient improved with noninvasive ventilation but then developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is now on meropenem for treatment.
   - Continue trial on pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation.
   - Unlikely extubation today given apnea.
   - Consider mandatory minute ventilation.
   - Continue daily arterial blood gas (VBG) analysis.

   Final Report
   HISTORY: PICC line placement.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-16**], the left subclavian
   catheter appears to have been withdrawn somewhat with the tip now in
   the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change.

   CXR [**2107-1-16**]
   Final Report
   HISTORY: Assess for NG tube placement.
   NG tube is partially obscured by spinal rods. However, the tip overlies
   the
   distal stomach. If an ET tube is present, it is not well visualized on
   these films. a Left subclavian line is present -- the tip overlies the
   upper RA.
   The thoracic cavity is atypical in morphology, consistent with the
   provided clinical history. Allowing for overlying materials, there is
   faint patchy opacity in the right mid zone similar to that demonstrated
   on a [**2107-1-12**] CT scan and consistent with aspiration pneumonia. No new
   opacity is identified.
   No CHF or effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: initial macro-aspiration with likely resultant
   ARDS, then improved, and now with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum
   cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with PSA, developing intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, so now on meropenem. Tolerating PS trials.  WBC down to 8.3
   today.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation.
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue lasix drip at 2mg/hr with goal even to slightly neg (for to
   cause contraction alkalosis)
   - continue meropenem for PSA
   - consider extubation today of patient tolerating pressure support
   trial.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg, L IJ
   out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and
   temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending. Galactomannan negative.  D/ced vanco Sunday as no evidence of
   GP bacteria.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.3 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - TBB goal even to slightly neg
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: tube feeds Boost glucose control at 40mg/hr
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above
   Lines: PICC Line - [**2107-1-14**] 04:09 PM

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently developed multiorgan system failure. He was intubated and on pressors but is now still intubated but off pressors. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. He has had multiple cultures drawn including blood, urine, and sputum. The patient's condition remains critical with ongoing respiratory failure, fevers, and positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture. He is tolerating pressure support trials and is being weaned down to 10/5. The patient's WBC count has decreased to 8.3. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with persistent respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture. The patient is on meropenem for this infection, and efforts are being made to wean him off the ventilator.
2. Fevers: The patient has had temperature elevations over the past few days. Initial investigations did not reveal any specific source of infection. However, recent addition of meropenem has led to improvement in temperatures. Further evaluation is"

   Final Report
   HISTORY: PICC line placement.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-16**], the left subclavian
   catheter appears to have been withdrawn somewhat with the tip now in
   the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change.

   CXR [**2107-1-16**]
   Final Report
   HISTORY: Assess for NG tube placement.
   NG tube is partially obscured by spinal rods. However, the tip overlies
   the
   distal stomach. If an ET tube is present, it is not well visualized on
   these films. a Left subclavian line is present -- the tip overlies the
   upper RA.
   The thoracic cavity is atypical in morphology, consistent with the
   provided clinical history. Allowing for overlying materials, there is
   faint patchy opacity in the right mid zone similar to that demonstrated
   on a [**2107-1-12**] CT scan and consistent with aspiration pneumonia. No new
   opacity is identified.
   No CHF or effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: initial macro-aspiration with likely resultant
   ARDS, then improved, and now with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum
   cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with PSA, developing intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, so now on meropenem. Tolerating PS trials.  WBC down to 8.3
   today.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation.
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue lasix drip at 2mg/hr with goal even to slightly neg (for to
   cause contraction alkalosis)
   - continue meropenem for PSA
   - consider extubation today of patient tolerating pressure support
   trial.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg, L IJ
   out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and
   temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending. Galactomannan negative.  D/ced vanco Sunday as no evidence of
   GP bacteria.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.3 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - TBB goal even to slightly neg
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: tube feeds Boost glucose control at 40mg/hr
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above
   Lines: PICC Line - [**2107-1-14**] 04:09 PM
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: heparin SC at reduced dose
   Stress ulcer: protonix
   VAP:
   Communication:  parents
   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition: ICU for now

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently developed multiorgan system failure (respiratory, renal, shock). The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, as well as receiving vasopressor support. He completed a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics and is still intubated but off vasopressors.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature has been intermittently elevated, with a fever of 101.2 on [Date]. Cultures have been obtained from blood, urine, and sputum. The patient is colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to meropenem. He is currently receiving meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with episodes of hypoxia and the need for pressure support ventilation (PSV). There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), given the presence of PSA in the sputum culture. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is down to 8.3 today.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level down to 1.3 from a peak in the mid-2s. The urine output is good, and the patient is tolerating a lasix drip."

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on
   [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **] problem) required switch back to AC. More alert, but still
   breathing at 14 now. Cause initial respiratory failure was aspiration
   with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with likely new
   pseudomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on
   meropenem.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation
   - consider mandatory minute ventilation if patient does not tolerate
   pressure support today
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas
   - ask ID whether would be worth double covering pt
s pseudomonas  given
   persistent positive sputum cultures
   - d/c vanc given no gram positives in cultures
   - discuss trach w/ family given 2 week intubation w/o successful
   weaning
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. WBC now at 8.3.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures
   still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and
   leukocytosis and temps.  Glucan > 500 twice with Galactomannan
   negative.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   - obtain LENIs to check for DVT as possible cause of fevers
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.2 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - as above: goal even to slightly neg
   - continue lasix with goal of even (pt no longer appears volume
   overloaded and has insensible losses from fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: restart tube feeds Boost glucose control at 40mg/hr
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above
   Lines: PICC Line - [**2107-1-14**] 04:09 PM
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: heparin SC at reduced dose,
   Stress ulcer: protonix
   VAP:  HOB elevation, mouth care, daily wake up, RSBI
   Communication:  parents
   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate) but not DNI

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed multi-organ system failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and shock. The patient was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, micafungin, and metronidazole) and has completed the course. He remains intubated but is off pressors. The sputum culture has grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to cefepime but sensitive to meropenem. Therefore, the patient has been switched to meropenem.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is sedated and responsive to voice, slightly agitated from the endotracheal tube.

The physical examination reveals clear lungs anteriorly, soft abdomen with no tenderness or guarding, and no peripheral edema. The lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 155 mg/dL.

The patient's renal function has improved, with a creatinine level down to 1.2 from peak levels in the mid-2s. The urine output has been good, and the patient is tolerating the Lasix drip.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was improving with PSV trials but experienced apnea, leading to switching back to assist-control (AC) ventilation. The cause of initial respiratory failure was aspiration with resultant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which improved. However, the patient now has likely new pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as indicated by sputum cultures. Therefore, the patient has been started on meropenem for pseudomonas.
   - Continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation
   - Consider mandatory minute ventilation if the patient does not tolerate pressure support today
   - Continue VBG daily
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas
   - Discuss tracheostomy with the family given two-week intubation without successful weaning

2. Fevers: The patient has had temperature elevations over the past few days, with a W"

   Final Report
   HISTORY: PICC line placement.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-16**], the left subclavian
   catheter appears to have been withdrawn somewhat with the tip now in
   the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change.

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Assess for NG tube placement.
   NG tube is partially obscured by spinal rods. However, the tip overlies
   the
   distal stomach. If an ET tube is present, it is not well visualized on
   these films. a Left subclavian line is present -- the tip overlies the
   upper RA.
   The thoracic cavity is atypical in morphology, consistent with the
   provided clinical history. Allowing for overlying materials, there is
   faint patchy opacity in the right mid zone similar to that demonstrated
   on a [**2107-1-12**] CT scan and consistent with aspiration pneumonia. No new
   opacity is identified.
   No CHF or effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: Significantly improved after doing well with
   PSV trial all day yesterday however alarming to apnea yesterday ([**Last Name **]
   problem) and has been off sedation however getting boluses of fenanyl
   and midaz. Went back to AC for apnea. More alert, but still breathing
   at 14 now. Cause of respiratory failure was thought initially
   macro-aspiration with likely resultant ARDS, then improved, and now
   with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with
   pseudamonas, developing intermediate sensitivity to zosyn, so now on
   meropenem.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus sedation.
   - Unlikely extubation today given apnea
   - consider mandatory minute ventilation
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue lasix drip at 2mg/hr with goal even
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas
   - ask ID whether would be worth double covering pt
s pseudomonas  given
   persistent positive sputum cultures
   - will clarify patient
s complicated abx history
   - DC vanc given no e/o gram positives in cultures
   - consider extubation today of patient tolerating pressure support
   trial.
   - d/w family re possible trach if no improvement
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg, L IJ
   out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and
   temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending. Galactomannan negative.  D/ced vanco Sunday as no evidence of
   GP bacteria.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan
   - obtain LENIs given fevers
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.2 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - TBB goal even to slightly neg
   - Monitor HCT
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: restart tube feeds Boost glucose control at 40mg/hr
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed multiorgan system failure, including respiratory, renal, and shock, and was intubated and on pressors. After completing a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient is still intubated but off pressors.
- The patient's 24-hour events include sputum culture, blood cultures from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, urine culture, fever, and changes in antibiotics, among others.
- The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, and blood cultures are pending. Sputum cultures have shown growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to meropenem. The patient is currently on meropenem and micafungin.
- The patient's respiratory failure initially improved but has now worsened, with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is ongoing consideration for mandatory minute ventilation and weaning off sedation.
- Other issues include anemia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. The patient's nutrition is being restarted with tube feeds, and glycemic control is being maintained with RISS and lantus.
- Prophylactic measures include anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Final Report
   HISTORY: PICC line placement.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-16**], the left subclavian
   catheter appears to have been withdrawn somewhat with the tip now in
   the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change.
   DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   Approved: MON [**2107-1-17**] 10:10 AM
   CXR [**2107-1-16**]
   Final Report
   HISTORY: Assess for NG tube placement.
   NG tube is partially obscured by spinal rods. However, the tip overlies
   the
   distal stomach. If an ET tube is present, it is not well visualized on
   these films. a Left subclavian line is present -- the tip overlies the
   upper RA.
   The thoracic cavity is atypical in morphology, consistent with the
   provided clinical history. Allowing for overlying materials, there is
   faint patchy opacity in the right mid zone similar to that demonstrated
   on a [**2107-1-12**] CT scan and consistent with aspiration pneumonia. No new
   opacity is identified.
   No CHF or effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: initial macro-aspiration with likely resultant
   ARDS, then improved, and now with likely new pseudomonal VAP.  Sputum
   cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**] with PSA, developing intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, so now on meropenem. Tolerating PS trials.  WBC down to 8.3
   today.
   - continue trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue lasix drip with goal even to slightly neg (for to cause
   contraction alkalosis)
   - continue meropenem for PSA
   - consider extubation today of patient tolerating pressure support
   trial.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still neg, L IJ
   out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and
   temps improving with addition of meropenem.  Glucan > 500, repeats
   pending. Galactomannan negative.  D/ced vanco Sunday as no evidence of
   GP bacteria.
   - Continue Meropenem
   - Continue micafungin given high glucan, f/up repeat glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.3 from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut), tolerating Lasix drip.
   - TBB goal even to slightly neg
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 27.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: tube feeds
   Glycemic Control:  RISS and lantus as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed multiorgan system failure, including respiratory failure, and was intubated and placed on pressors. The patient completed a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics and is still intubated but off pressors. He has been experiencing fevers, and blood cultures are pending. The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which he is receiving meropenem. Other issues include acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and anemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being weaned down to 10/5. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL. Imaging studies reveal no periosteal reaction or signs of osteomyelitis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar non-keptic (HNK) coma, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

24-hour events include fever, cultures taken from blood, PICC line, and urine. The patient has been febrile overnight and tolerating pressure support (PS) yesterday, but returned to assisted control ventilation (ACV) in the evening due to apnea and low respiratory rates.

Medications include Micafungin, Vancomycin, Meropenem, Furosemide (Lasix), Fentanyl, Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and Pantoprazole (Protonix). Other ICU medications are per month.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 mmHg to 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 36.7 kg.

The patient has been intubated for two weeks and continues to fail weaning attempts. There is an issue of tracheostomy to be addressed with the family. The patient has developed VAP and PSA, with extensive workup"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old man with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK) and is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 mmHg to 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and slightly elevated platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 110 mg/dL to 176 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate abnormal kidney function, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia. 

Microbiology tests reveal positive results for fungal markers (BDG) and a sputum culture with min PSA, indicating a pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on meropenem for treatment.

Assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to initial macro-aspiration with resultant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), then improvement, and now pseudomonal VAP. The patient's fever is attributed to no osteomyelitis by X-ray/bone scan, all"

   - LENI's limited but negative (prelim)
   - ID did not think double covering for psuedomonas was worthwhile

   - ID said extubating would help to clear his PNA by helping him clear
   his secretions

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 25-year-old man with cerebral palsy. Now fever despite
   antibiotics.
   Assess for DVT.
   COMPARISON: Limited comparison from prior left lower extremity DVT
   study on
   [**2107-1-5**].
   Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 9467**] were obtained from the bilateral lower
   extremities. The study is slightly limited by the baseline small
   caliber of
   veins and also by patient's left lower extremity contracture. Allowing
   for
   the limitations, there is unchanged lack of respiratory variability in
   the
   left common femoral vein. The left common femoral vein is otherwise
   fully
   compressible and without evidence of thrombosis. The bilateral
   superficial
   femoral, popliteal and calf veins as well as the right common femoral
   vein are
   normal in compressibility, augmentation and Doppler waveforms. There is
   no
   evidence of DVT.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study but no evidence of DVT in either
   lower
   extremity.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with likely new
   pseudomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on
   meropenem. Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **]
   problem) required switch to pressure support with MMV.  Cause of
   current apnea is unknown.
   Pt is more alert now and venous gases show no acid base disturbance.
   ID recs say extubation would allow patient to better clear secretions.
   In reviewing antibiotic history, ID rec against double coverage for pan
   resistant pseudomonas.
   - continue another trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus
   sedation
   - consider extubation if patient tolerates pressure support today
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Tmax today 100.7 and Tcurrent 99.2.  WBC leukocytosis resolving
   with WBC now at 7.3 from 8.3 yesterday.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan,
   all blood cultures still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now
   with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and temps.  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.0 today from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 23.3 today.
   - continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Boost glucose control
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale, Blood sugar well
   controlled

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy, who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure. He had an initial respiratory failure due to aspiration with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has improved but is now likely suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as indicated by sputum cultures. The patient's condition has been improving with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The medical team is considering extubation if the patient tolerates pressure support and continues to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if the underlying cause of the current apnea is not identified and addressed promptly.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient may develop further complications from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, such as worsening lung function or dissemination of the infection.
3. Fevers: The patient's persistent fever could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response that needs to be investigated and managed appropriately.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient may experience fluctuations in blood glucose levels, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels should be closely monitored and managed with appropriate fluid replacement"

   - discussed transfer to CHB with parents and talked to CHB ICU. They
   will discuss him on [**1-19**] and get back to us.
   - SBP fell to 80s. Lasix drip stopped. Given 500ml NS.
   - He did PSV 12/5 still with multiple apneic episodes and therefore
   switched to MMV
   - MAPs were above 60 but still hypotensive, stopped Lasix drip and gave
   a bolus
   - LENI's limited but negative (prelim)
   - ID did not think double covering for psuedomonas was worthwhile
   because this is normally done for covering for resistance, since this
   is a pansensitive organism, not useful
   - ID said extubating would help to clear his PNA by helping him clear
   his secretions

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 25-year-old man with cerebral palsy. Now fever despite
   antibiotics.
   Assess for DVT.
   COMPARISON: Limited comparison from prior left lower extremity DVT
   study on
   [**2107-1-5**].
   Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 9467**] were obtained from the bilateral lower
   extremities. The study is slightly limited by the baseline small
   caliber of
   veins and also by patient's left lower extremity contracture. Allowing
   for
   the limitations, there is unchanged lack of respiratory variability in
   the
   left common femoral vein. The left common femoral vein is otherwise
   fully
   compressible and without evidence of thrombosis. The bilateral
   superficial
   femoral, popliteal and calf veins as well as the right common femoral
   vein are
   normal in compressibility, augmentation and Doppler waveforms. There is
   no
   evidence of DVT.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study but no evidence of DVT in either
   lower
   extremity.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with likely new
   pseudomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on
   meropenem. Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **]
   problem) required switch to pressure support with MMV.  Cause of
   current apnea is unknown.
   Pt is more alert now and venous gases show no acid base disturbance.
   ID recs say extubation would allow patient to better clear secretions.
   In reviewing antibiotic history, ID rec against double coverage for pan
   resistant pseudomonas.
   RSBI today = 172, however, patient has small, unique habitus and has
   6.0mm ET tube (two factors known to increase RSBI)
   - continue another trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus
   sedation
   - consider extubation today
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Tmax today 100.7 and Tcurrent 99.2.  WBC leukocytosis resolving
   with WBC now at 7.3 from 8.3 yesterday.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan,
   all blood cultures still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now
   with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and temps.  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.0 today from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 23.3 today.
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). He has been in the ICU for persistent respiratory failure, initially due to aspiration-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and now likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support, including pressure support ventilation (PSV) and mandatory minute volume (MMV). His vital signs are stable, but he continues to have fevers, leukocytosis, and positive sputum cultures for Pseudomonas. His renal function has improved, and hyperglycemia is well-controlled. Anemia is likely secondary to phlebotomy. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and there are plans for possible transfer to another hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current respiratory failure is likely due to VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He has been started on meropenem, an antibiotic effective against Pseudomonas.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's limited mobility and immobility due to mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of DVT. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities showed no evidence"

   - discussed transfer to CHB with parents and talked to CHB ICU. They
   will discuss him on [**1-19**] and get back to us.
   - SBP fell to 80s. Lasix drip stopped. Given 500ml NS.
   - He did PSV 12/5 still with multiple apneic episodes and therefore
   switched to MMV
   - MAPs were above 60 but still hypotensive, stopped Lasix drip and gave
   a bolus
   - LENI's limited but negative (prelim)
   - ID did not think double covering for psuedomonas was worthwhile
   because this is normally done for covering for resistance, since this
   is a pansensitive organism, not useful
   - ID said extubating would help to clear his PNA by helping him clear
   his secretions

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 25-year-old man with cerebral palsy. Now fever despite
   antibiotics.
   Assess for DVT.
   COMPARISON: Limited comparison from prior left lower extremity DVT
   study on
   [**2107-1-5**].
   Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 9467**] were obtained from the bilateral lower
   extremities. The study is slightly limited by the baseline small
   caliber of
   veins and also by patient's left lower extremity contracture. Allowing
   for
   the limitations, there is unchanged lack of respiratory variability in
   the
   left common femoral vein. The left common femoral vein is otherwise
   fully
   compressible and without evidence of thrombosis. The bilateral
   superficial
   femoral, popliteal and calf veins as well as the right common femoral
   vein are
   normal in compressibility, augmentation and Doppler waveforms. There is
   no
   evidence of DVT.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study but no evidence of DVT in either
   lower
   extremity.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with likely new
   pseudomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on
   meropenem. Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **]
   problem) required switch to pressure support with MMV.  Cause of
   current apnea is unknown.
   Pt is more alert now and venous gases show no acid base disturbance.
   ID recs say extubation would allow patient to better clear secretions.
   In reviewing antibiotic history, ID rec against double coverage for pan
   resistant pseudomonas.
   RSBI today = 172, however, patient has small, unique habitus and has
   6.0mm ET tube (two factors known to increase RSBI)
   - cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue another trial on PS weaning down to 10/5 today with bolus
   sedation
   - get NIFF today
   - consider extubation today
   - continue VBG daily
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Tmax today 100.7 and Tcurrent 99.2.  WBC leukocytosis resolving
   with WBC now at 7.3 from 8.3 yesterday.  No osteo by x-ray/bone scan,
   all blood cultures still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed. Now
   with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and temps.  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.0 today from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (Urine
   OutPut).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus
   5. Hyperatremia: improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H.
   Na 148 today.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 23.3 today.
   - continue to monitor

- ID recommends extubation would allow the patient to better clear secretions.
- RSBI today = 172, however, the patient has a small, unique habitus and has a 6.0mm ET tube (two factors known to increase RSBI).
- The patient has had temperature elevations over the past several days, with a maximum temperature of 100.7 and current temperature of 99.2.
- WBC leukocytosis is resolving with WBC now at 7.3 from 8.3 yesterday.
- No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still negative, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
- Now with PSA VAP, and leukocytosis and temperatures. Glucan > 500 twice with Galactomannan negative.
- Continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum.
- Continue micafungin given high glucan.
- Creatinine down to 1.0 today from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP.
- Continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and has insensible losses from fever).
- Hyperglycemia is well controlled on current lantus + ISS.
- Continue RISS and lantus.
- Hypernatremia improved with increased free water boluses to 250 Q4H. Na 148 today.
- Continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H.
- Anemia likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 23.3 today.
- Continue to monitor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration with resultant ARDS and now with likely new pseudomonal VAP. This requires careful monitoring and management with appropriate antibiotics and consideration for extubation.
2. Fevers: The patient has had temperature elevations over the past several days. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of these fevers, considering the possibility of an ongoing infection.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count has shown leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring of the white blood cell count and evaluation"

   - discussed transfer to CHB with parents and talked to CHB ICU. They
   will discuss him on [**1-19**] and get back to us.
   - SBP fell to 80s. Lasix drip stopped. Given 500ml NS.
   - He did PSV 12/5 still with multiple apneic episodes and therefore
   switched to MMV
   - MAPs were above 60 but still hypotensive, stopped Lasix drip and gave
   a bolus
   - LENI's limited but negative (prelim)
   - ID did not think double covering for psuedomonas was worthwhile
   because this is normally done for covering for resistance, since this
   is a pansensitive organism, not useful
   - ID said extubating would help to clear his PNA by helping him clear
   his secretions

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 25-year-old man with cerebral palsy. Now fever despite
   antibiotics.
   Assess for DVT.
   COMPARISON: Limited comparison from prior left lower extremity DVT
   study on
   [**2107-1-5**].
   Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 9467**] were obtained from the bilateral lower
   extremities. The study is slightly limited by the baseline small
   caliber of
   veins and also by patient's left lower extremity contracture. Allowing
   for
   the limitations, there is unchanged lack of respiratory variability in
   the
   left common femoral vein. The left common femoral vein is otherwise
   fully
   compressible and without evidence of thrombosis. The bilateral
   superficial
   femoral, popliteal and calf veins as well as the right common femoral
   vein are
   normal in compressibility, augmentation and Doppler waveforms. There is
   no
   evidence of DVT.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study but no evidence of DVT in either
   lower
   extremity.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy who presented with fever despite receiving antibiotics.
- He has a history of chronic respiratory failure due to hypoventilation and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, fever, hypotension, diarrhea, acute renal failure, and anemia.
- He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal renal and liver function tests.
- Imaging studies show no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities.
- Microbiology cultures are pending, but preliminary results suggest the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in respiratory cultures.
- The patient has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory cultures and clinical signs of infection is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient's DVT ultrasound was negative, he is still at risk for developing clots due to immobility and central venous catheters. Regular assessment and prophylactic measures are essential.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest possible AKI. Close monitoring of fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal status. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome and persistent respiratory failure, now with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/61 mmHg to 88/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. He has been intubated for two weeks and has failed wean attempts. The patient is currently making progress, more alert, with minimal symptoms, and may be reassessed for possible extubation with anesthesia present. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced macro-aspiration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and now has pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is a risk of further respiratory complications due to prolonged intubation and failed wean attempts.

2. VAP: The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for pseudomonal infection, and follow-up cultures are being obtained for additional gram-negative rods. Given positive beta-D-glucan (BDG), micaf"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of DKA/HNK and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressures set at 12 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/61 mmHg to 88/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including ARDS and VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA). They have been on various medications such as vancomycin, micafungin, and meropenem. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, and extensive workup has not revealed any evidence of osteomyelitis. The patient's LFTs and LENIs are normal. 

The patient's renal function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level. Their blood glucose levels are well controlled with insulin. Hyperatremia is improving with increased free water boluses. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and VAP.
2. Infection due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.
3. Renal dysfunction despite improving creatinine levels.
4. Hyperglyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with
   pseudomonal and stenotrophomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from
   [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on meropenem and bactrim.
   Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **] problem)
   required switch to pressure support with MMV.
   Pt is more alert now and venous gases show no acid base disturbance.
   NIFF yesterday of 19 could be appropriate for patient given small,
   unique habitus and has 6.0mm ET tube.
   - review cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue MMV with PS not going below [**9-6**] today with bolus sedation
   - consider extubation today if not transferring to CHB
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas and bactrim (start
   [**1-19**]) for stenotrophomonas. Appreciate ID recs.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Now with PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but resolving leukocytosis (WBC
   9.8) and temps (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8).  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative. No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures
   still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue bactrim for steno tropho monas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.0 yesterday and today from peak in mid-2s, with
   good UOP (of 990ml since midnight).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from previous fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus. Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   5. Hyperatremia: rose somewhat last night after holding all tube feeds
   and improved with continuation free water boluses to 250 Q4H. Na 141
   this morning.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 24.8 today.
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed respiratory failure due to aspiration, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's organ failures have resolved, and he came off pressors but developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and apneic episodes on the ventilator. The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, fever, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and anemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pseudomonal and stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to previous sputum cultures.
2. Persistent respiratory failure leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Recurrence of septic shock due to persistent infection.
4. Progression of acute kidney injury (ARF) leading to oliguria or anuria.
5. Poor glycemic control leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
6. Hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis or osmotic demyelination syndrome.
7. Anemia leading to decreased tissue oxygenation and perfusion.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization.
9. Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or urinary tract infection (UTI)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He was intubated and developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's organ failures resolved and he came off pressors but developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and apneic episodes on the ventilator.

24-hour events:
- The patient was accepted at Hospital1 and had a net positive fluid balance of 1.9 liters.
- His sodium levels increased to 149 (likely due to holding tube feeds), and free water flushes were increased to 250 q 2h overnight and then held all tube feeds/h20 at 6am.
- The patient started receiving bactrim for stenotrophomonas infection.
- His last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 01/17/2107 at 07:30 PM, Micafungin on 01/19/2107 at 05:15 PM, Bactrim on 01/20/2107 at 12:00 AM, and Meropenem on 01/20/2107 at 04:00 AM.
- He was given Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) on 01/19/2107 at 08:06 AM.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
- Heart Rate: 113 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 118/71 mmHg (82/45-118/"

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with
   pseudomonal and stenotrophomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from
   [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on meropenem and bactrim.
   Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **] problem)
   required switch to pressure support with MMV.
   Pt is more alert now and venous gases show no acid base disturbance.
   NIFF yesterday of 19 could be appropriate for patient given small,
   unique habitus and has 6.0mm ET tube.
   - review cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue MMV with PS not going below [**9-6**] today with bolus sedation
   - consider extubation today if not transferring to CHB
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas and bactrim (start
   [**1-19**]) for stenotrophomonas. Appreciate ID recs.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Now with PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but resolving leukocytosis (WBC
   9.8) and temps (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8).  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative. No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures
   still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue bactrim for steno tropho monas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.0 yesterday and today from peak in mid-2s, with
   good UOP (of 990ml since midnight).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from previous fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus. Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   5. Hyperatremia: rose somewhat last night after holding all tube feeds
   and improved with continuation free water boluses to 250 Q4H. Na 141
   this morning.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 24.8 today.
   - continue to monitor
    ICU Care
   Nutrition: Boost glucose control
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale, Blood sugar well
   controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS). He developed respiratory failure after aspiration, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's organ failures have resolved, and he has come off the pressors. However, he has now developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and apneic episodes while on the ventilator.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The initial respiratory failure was caused by aspiration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has improved. However, the patient has developed pseudomonal and stenotrophomonas VAP based on sputum cultures from [date range]. He is currently being treated with meropenem and bactrim.
2. Fevers: The patient has had temperature elevations over the past few days. He now has PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but is showing signs of resolving leukocytosis (WBC 9.8) and temperatures (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8). Glucan > 500 twice with Galactomannan negative. No osteo by X-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures still negative, and new PICC placed.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has decreased to 1.0 from a"

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with
   pseudomonal and stenotrophomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from
   [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on meropenem and bactrim.
   Was improving with PSV trials. However apnea on [**1-17**] ([**Last Name **] problem)
   required switch to pressure support with MMV.
   Pt is more alert now and venous gases show no acid base disturbance.
   NIFF yesterday of 19 could be appropriate for patient given small,
   unique habitus and has 6.0mm ET tube.
   - review cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue MMV with PS not going below [**9-6**] today with bolus sedation
   - consider extubation today if not transferring to CHB
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas and bactrim (start
   [**1-19**]) for stenotrophomonas. Appreciate ID recs.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Now with PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but resolving leukocytosis (WBC
   9.8) and temps (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8).  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative. No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures
   still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue bactrim for steno tropho monas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 1.0 yesterday and today from peak in mid-2s, with
   good UOP (of 990ml since midnight).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from previous fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus. Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   5. Hyperatremia: rose somewhat last night after holding all tube feeds
   and improved with continuation free water boluses to 250 Q4H. Na 141
   this morning.
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit Sat with
   appropriate response. Guaiac neg. HCT 24.8 today.
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and subsequently developed respiratory failure, renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's organ failures have resolved, and they have come off pressors. However, the patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and apneic episodes on the ventilator.

24-hour events include accepting the patient at Hospital1, starting tube feeds at 80 mL/kg/day, increasing free water flushes, starting bactrim for stenotrophomonas infection, and providing a total net positive fluid balance of 1.9 liters.

The patient has a history of allergies to Name2 (NI) and known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin on 01/17/2107 at 07:30 PM, micafungin on 01/19/2107 at 05:15 PM, bactrim on 01/20/2107 at 12:00 AM, and meropenem on 01/20/2107 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include flowsheet data as of 01/20/2107 at 07:17 AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a pediatric patient in the ICU with several ongoing health issues. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by macro-aspiration and subsequent ARDS. The patient now has pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is breathing spontaneously on pressure support (PS) and continues to have thick secretions. Oral secretions are significant, but there are no significant changes in symptoms. The physician prefers to keep the patient intubated until transfer to Children's Hospital to ensure stability for transport. If transfer is not possible, the patient may be ready for an extubation attempt. Typical parameters for extubation are difficult to guide due to high respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The physician recommends completing a 14-day course of meropenem for pseudomonal VAP. The patient's blood glucose levels are well controlled on current insulin therapy. The patient's creatinine level continues to improve, and urine output remains adequate. The patient's sodium levels have improved with free water administration. Anemia is likely from chronic diseases and phlebotomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to macro-aspiration with resultant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and now has pseudomonal VAP. This indicates an ongoing risk for respiratory complications.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pseudomonal VAP,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and non-verbal at baseline. He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypernatremia, now with persistent respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 106/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range or stable. The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for previous pneumonia and is currently receiving Bactrim for stenotrophomonas infection. The patient's condition remains unstable, and extubation attempt is planned with anesthesia present. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a potential complication from ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate management of the patient's respiratory status is crucial.
2. VAP: The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, which increases the risk of worsening lung infection and possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with
   pseudomonal and stenotrophomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from
   [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on meropenem and bactrim.
   Was improving with PSV trials. However episodes of apnea started on
   [**1-17**] and required switch to pressure support with MMV.
   CXR from [**1-19**] showed possible worsening of pulmonary edema and possibly
   of effusions.
   VBG from today showed pH = 7.53 and CO2 = 26.
   Respiratory assessments must consider that patient has small, unique
   habitus and has 6.0mm ET tube.
   - order cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue MMV with PS not going below [**9-6**] today with bolus sedation
   - consider extubation today if not transferring to CHB
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas and bactrim (start
   [**1-19**]) for stenotrophomonas.
   - continue voriconazole as per ID recs.
   2.  Fevers: patient has had temperature elevations over past several
   days. Now with PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but resolving leukocytosis (WBC
   9.8) and temps (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8).  Glucan > 500 twice with
   Galactomannan negative. No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all blood cultures
   still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue bactrim for steno tropho monas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Cr down to 0.8 today from peak in mid-2s, with good UOP (of
   380ml since midnight).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from previous fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus. Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   5. Hyperatremia: stable at 144 today
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit this morning
   after HCT showed 21.5 (last transfusion was HCT 21.6)
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and subsequently developed multiorgan system failure. The patient is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure with periods of apnea. 

24-hour events include:
- Stopped micafungin and started voriconazole due to high beta glucans indicating possible fungal infection.
- Increased dosing of bactrim.
- Restarted tube feeds.
- Did not extubate due to episodes of apnea.
- Administered a 500cc bolus and improved oxygenation.
- Chest X-ray showed worsening pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions.
- Sputum culture revealed gram-negative rods and budding yeast, indicating a possible pseudomonal and stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Respiratory support: MMV/PSV mode with set tidal volume of 280mL, PEEP of 5cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 135.
- Blood gases: pH 7.53, CO2 26, HCO3- 23, BE -2, O2 saturation 99%.
- Physical examination: stable vitals, no changes noted.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He subsequently aspirated and developed multiorgan system failure. Currently, he is experiencing persistent respiratory failure with periods of apnea. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including micafungin, meropenem, bactrim, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. His vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, high potassium level, and low bicarbonate level. His blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis with an increased pCO2 level. 

Imaging studies reveal worsened pulmonary edema, bilateral small pleural effusions, and increased left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia. 

Microbiology reports show the presence of gram-negative rods and budding yeast in the sputum sample. Respiratory culture is pending. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient remains in the ICU for ongoing care and management. Regular chest physiotherapy and suctioning are recommended due to periods of apnea. Fluid balance and electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored as well."

   [**1-20**]
   - No bed at [**Hospital1 574**] on Thursday
   - Stopped micafungin, but id wanted voriconazole given repeated high
   beta glucans (not clearing on micafungin). b-glucan sensitive for
   fungal (aspirgillosus), while galactomannan neg this is specific but
   less sensitive for aspirg and fungal infx can occur in pts w/ dka.
   - Increased bactrim dosing
   - Restarted tube feeds
   - Did not extubate bc had periods of apnea
   - Got 500 cc bolus, looked somewhat dehydrated, not drooling
   - Patient desated overnight to 90%; improved w/ Chest PT and suctioning
   (suggest chest PT regularly)
   - Phos, Mag, K repleted

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with microcephaly/CP, non-verbal at baseline, admitted with
   DKA/HHS, now with persistent respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with
   pseudomonal and stenotrophomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from
   [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on meropenem and bactrim.
   Was improving with PSV trials. However episodes of apnea started on
   [**1-17**] and required switch to pressure support with MMV.
   CXR from [**1-19**] showed possible worsening of pulmonary edema and possibly
   of effusions.
   VBG from today showed pH = 7.53 and CO2 = 26.
   Respiratory assessments must consider that patient has small, unique
   habitus and has 6.0mm ET tube.
   - Wean down vent
s MMV settings (currently Vol=280 and RR=12) since he
   has been overventilated as evidenced by his VBG.  We want CO2 back up
   to his baseline (likely above 40) for goal of extubation today, since
   CHB does not have a bed
   - order cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue MMV with PS not going below [**9-6**] today with bolus sedation
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas and bactrim (start
   [**1-19**]) for stenotrophomonas.
   - continue voriconazole as per ID recs.  Ask ID if we should repeat
   BGlucan and Galacto.
   2.  Fevers: Improving. Patient has had temperature elevations over past
   several days. Now with PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but resolving
   leukocytosis (WBC 9.8) and temps (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8).  Glucan >
   500 twice with Galactomannan negative. No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all
   blood cultures still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue bactrim for steno tropho monas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Resolved. Cr down to 0.8 today from peak in mid-2s, with good
   UOP (of 380ml since midnight).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from previous fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: Resolved. well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus. Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   5. Hyperatremia: stable at 144 today
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit this morning
   after HCT showed 21.5 (last transfusion was HCT 21.6)
   - continue to monitor HCT

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He developed respiratory failure due to aspiration and had multi-organ system failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has periods of apnea. He has a history of fungal infection and is being treated with micafungin, but his beta-glucan levels remain high, indicating a possible fungal infection with Aspergillus species. The patient also has a respiratory culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, for which he is receiving meropenem and bactrim respectively. His other labs show resolving leukocytosis and fever, improved renal function, well-controlled hyperglycemia, and stable hypernatremia. The patient's anemia is likely secondary to phlebotomy. The plan is to wean down the ventilator settings, continue with current antibiotics, restart tube feeds, and discuss possible transfer to another facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pseudomonal and stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Recurrence of fungal infection due to Aspergillus species.
3. Hyperglycemia and hypernatremia if glucose and fluid control is not maintained.
4. Anemia from repeated phlebotomy.
5. Poor nutritional status due to prolonged tube feeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy and microcephaly who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He subsequently aspirated and developed multi-organ system failure. Currently, he is experiencing persistent respiratory failure with periods of apnea. 

24-hour events:
- Stopped micafungin and started voriconazole due to high beta glucans.
- Increased bactrim dosing.
- Restarted tube feeds.
- Did not extubate due to periods of apnea.
- Gave a 500cc bolus and the patient looked somewhat dehydrated, not drooling.
- Patient desaturated overnight to 90% but improved with chest physiotherapy and suctioning.
- Repleted phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium.
- Obtained history from family/friend.
- Allergies: Name2 (NI) Known Drug Allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Micafungin - 01/19/2107 05:15 PM, Meropenem - 01/21/2107 03:41 AM, Bactrim (SMX/TMP) - 01/21/2107 05:49 AM.

   1. Respiratory failure:  Cause of initial respiratory failure was
   aspiration with resultant ARDS, which improved. But now with
   pseudomonal and stenotrophomonal VAP as per sputum cultures from
   [**Date range (1) 13319**], so now on meropenem and bactrim.
   Was improving with PSV trials. However episodes of apnea started on
   [**1-17**] and required switch to pressure support with MMV.
   CXR from [**1-19**] showed possible worsening of pulmonary edema and possibly
   of effusions.
   VBG from today showed pH = 7.53 and CO2 = 26.
   Respiratory assessments must consider that patient has small, unique
   habitus and has 6.0mm ET tube.
   - Wean down vent settings as has been overventilated for goal of
   extubation today as long as does not have a bed
   - order cxr today to eval interval change
   - continue MMV with PS not going below [**9-6**] today with bolus sedation
   - consider extubation today if not transferring to CHB
   - continue meropenem (start [**1-15**]) for pseudomonas and bactrim (start
   [**1-19**]) for stenotrophomonas.
   - continue voriconazole as per ID recs.
   2.  Fevers: Improving. Patient has had temperature elevations over past
   several days. Now with PSA/stenotrophomonas VAP but resolving
   leukocytosis (WBC 9.8) and temps (Tmax=99.7, Tcurrent=98.8).  Glucan >
   500 twice with Galactomannan negative. No osteo by x-ray/bone scan, all
   blood cultures still neg, L IJ out on Sunday, new PICC placed.
   - continue meropenem for pseudomonas in sputum
   - continue bactrim for steno tropho monas in sputum
   - continue micafungin given high glucan
   3. ARF: Resolved. Cr down to 0.8 today from peak in mid-2s, with good
   UOP (of 380ml since midnight).
   - continue to hold lasix (pt no longer appears volume overloaded and
   has insensible losses from previous fever)
   4. Hyperglycemia: Resolved. well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   - continue RISS and lantus. Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   5. Hyperatremia: stable at 144 today
   - continue free water boluses at 250ml Q4H
   6. Anemia: likely secondary to phlebotomy, pt had 1 unit this morning
   after HCT showed 21.5 (last transfusion was HCT 21.6)
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with microcephaly and cerebral palsy who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and subsequently developed multiorgan system failure. He is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure with periods of apnea. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been on various medications including micafungin, meropenem, bactrim, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures have been negative so far.

The patient's imaging studies reveal worsening pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions. The respiratory culture indicates the presence of gram-negative rods and budding yeast, suggesting a possible pneumonia infection.

The patient's plan of care includes weaning down ventilator settings, continuing mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and considering extubation if there are no bed availability issues. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated to cover for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, both identified in the sputum cultures.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close"

   # Respiratory failure: initially [**1-4**] macro-aspiration w/ resultant
   ARDS, now w/ resolving PSA and stenotroph VAP.
   . Continues to have thick secretions and oral secretions, though
   without increased sx requirements. Continues to have intermittent
   apneas on vent . Was briefly on apnea mode yesterday and now appears
   overventilated w/ more alkalotic ABG.  This is most likely contributing
   to a  decreased resp drive. Pt very likely has some component of
   underlying central and/or obstructive sleep disordered breathing at
   baseline.  Typical parameters to guide extubation are difficult to
   follow in this pt, and his RSBI remains high. Will check for air leak,
   noting difficulty with sx and difficult intubation. He seems close to
   ready for extubation attempt, pending improvement in alkalosis.
   --will optimize MV on MMV to prevent over breathing/alkalosis and allow
   his CO2 to equilibriate to baseline elevation.
   --repeat VBG and reassess this afternoon for extubation attempt
   --he is at risk for reintubation and would procede with anesthesia
   present, possible over catheter.
   # VAP
remains AF (low grade) w/o leukocytosis
   - Day [**6-15**] meropenem for PSA and Bactrim day [**2-13**] for stenotroph
   --Given pos BDG we have changed to vori and will reasses fungal
   markers.
   # Low grade temp
has had extensive inf eval/ we continue with vigilant
   infection assessment
   Repeat cxr  and ua/cx
   Consider re-evaluation of sinuses, for AFL
   # ARF: Cr improved, UOP remains adequate
   #Hypernatremia--resolved with free water
   # Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   # anemia--no evidence of active bleeding, heme neg stool, likely from
   chronic ds and phlebotomy, transfused today and continue to monitor and

   Continues to have intermittent apneas on vent precluding extiubation.
   Was briefly on apnea mode yesterday and overventilated now with
   alkalotic ABG which is liejkly continuting furtehr to diminshed respo
   drive.  Pt likely has underlying central/obstructive SDB at baseline.
   Still with thick secretions and significant oral secretions.
   --will allow for requilibriation of his crhonic co2 retention with
   decreasing MV on MMV/PS and follow vbg.  Will reassess this afternoon
   for extubation attempt
   I do think he is now w/i a window for extubation attempt, though at
   risk for reintuabtion. Would  procede with anesthesia present, possible
   over catheter.
   Typical parameters are difficult to guide, as RSBI remains high.
    Check for air leak.
   # VAP-- now AF w/o leukocytosis
   - Completing [**6-15**] day course meropenem for PSA, and Bactrim day [**2-13**]
   for stenotroph
   --Given pos BDG we have changed to vori and will reasses fungal
   markers.
   # ARF: Cr stable now, UOP remains adequate
   #Hypernatremia--improved with free water
   # Hyperglycemia: well controlled on current lantus + ISS
   # anemia--no evidence of active bleeding, heme neg stool, likely from

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU for DKA/HNK and respiratory failure. They have a history of multiple complications including ARDS, VAP, and now AF (aspiration pneumonia). The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with intermittent apneas on the ventilator, making extubation risky. They are being weaned off mechanical ventilation but still require assistance. There are concerns about underlying central/obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's renal function is stable, and their hypernatremia and hyperglycemia have improved. Anemia is likely due to chronic diseases and phlebotomy. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Their code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable with intermittent apneas on the ventilator, making extubation risky. There are concerns about underlying central/obstructive sleep apnea.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is now antibiotic-resistant. Treatment involves changing antibiotics and maintaining good oral hygiene.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially had ARDS, which has partially resolved. However, the patient continues to have difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia (AF): The patient has"

- The patient was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure.
- The initial respiratory failure was due to aspiration resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which improved, but the patient now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as per sputum cultures.
- The patient is currently on meropenem and bactrim for VAP treatment.
- The patient has small, unique habitus with a 6.0mm endotracheal (ET) tube.
- There have been episodes of apnea since January 17th, requiring a switch from pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials to pressure support with mandatory minute volume (MMV).
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) has improved, and there are discussions about potential extubation.
- The patient has low-grade fevers, which are being monitored, and infectious workup is negative.
- Micafungin was changed to voriconazole as per infectious disease (ID) recommendations.
- Acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, and the patient's urine output is good.
