   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), and colon cancer. He presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have hypotension (blood pressure of 85/53), tachycardia (heart rate of 100), and a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). During the infusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), he developed chest pain but had a negative transfusion workup. He received nitroglycerin (NTG) and had some shortness of breath, for which he was given Lasix. His blood pressure dropped to the 50s systolic at midnight and remained low despite fluid boluses. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) where his blood pressure improved to 85 and his heart rate stabilized in the 70s. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16-22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The positive guaiac test indicates active bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which could be from an upper or lower source."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), and colon cancer (CA). He presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain and was found to have hypotension (BP 85/53) and tachycardia (HR 100). He also had anemia (Hct 20) and a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). During the infusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), he developed chest pain, but a negative transfusion workup ruled out transfusion reaction. He received nitroglycerin (NTG) and Lasix for his symptoms. His blood pressure remained low (SBP 50s systolic) and he required fluid boluses. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) where his blood pressure improved to 85 and heart rate decreased to the 70s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to diuresis and IV NTG, but it has largely resolved on its own. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further hypotension.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's positive guaiac test and episode of melena indicate possible GIB. Continued intravenous proton pump inhibitor"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of wheezing and distress, which occurred after the transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient was diuresed with Lasix, but subsequently developed abdominal pain, which was likely due to Foley catheter removal and resulting urinary obstruction and retention. Despite multiple attempts, floor attempts to place a new Foley catheter were unsuccessful, possibly because the patient had pulled on the Foley prior to removal and had created multiple tracks with each successive attempt. Urology was consulted, and a coudee catheter was replaced with return of clear urine.

The patient has known benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and possible adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The patient's allergies are not known. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 09/01/2123 at 08:00 AM. The patient received infusions of pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:00 AM on 09/01/2123, furosemide (Lasix) at 05:00 PM on 09/01/2123, metoprolol at 05:15 PM on 09/01/2123, and morphine sulfate at 06:15 PM on 09/01/2123. Other medications include pantoprazole, furosemide, metoprolol, and morphine sulfate."

   Assessment and Plan
   97-F w/ CAD s/p multiple interventions and h/o GIB w/ ongoing melanotic
   stools, who p/w worsening chest pain in the setting of Hct 20,
   worsening STd epressions on ECG, and ? transfusion reaction, now
   transferred to the MICU for care given persistently low BPs.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Pt transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring and
   care of his hypotension. Hypotension occurred on the floor in the
   setting of multiple possible etiologies. Pt p/w chest pain and has ST
   depressions on his ECG with a troponin bump, likely [**2-13**] demand
   ischemia, but consideration should be given to cardiogenic shock as a
   potential etiology. More obvious is the pt's low hematocrit at 20 on
   arrival, which is likely [**2-13**] GI bleeding as the pt had a witnessed
   large melanotic stool on the floor prior to his hypotension. The pt
   also had developed chest pain in the setting of being transfused, so
   the hypotension may be [**2-13**] transfusion reaction. Additionally, the pt
   received a lot of fluid in the form of PRBCs and IVF hydration, which
   made his saturations worse, and he received Lasix shortly before
   dropping his BPs, which would have contributed, esp in the setting of
   his known moderate-severe aortic stenosis. Finally, after receiving the
   Lasix, the pt was restarted on all his home anti-hypertensives, which
   he received at the same time that night. Most likely the persistent
   hypotension resistant to fluid boluses was [**2-13**] a combination of these
   factors, especially the medication effect. On arrival to the MICU the
   pt's SBP was in the mid 80s and improving.
   - cont close monitoring of pt's SBP
   - given that he is asymptomatic would be hesitant to start a
   vasopressor, esp given his concurrent comorbidities including the GI
   bleeding and demand ischemia
   - SBPs currently improving as the medication effect of pt's
   anti-hypertensives and Lasix wears off
   - treat GI bleeding as below
   - hold anti-hypertensives for now until pt's SBP improves to baseline
   - gentle diuresis only as needed if pt becomes SOB from worsening
   pulmonary congestion, as evidenced on physical exam / CXR
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   #. GI bleeding - Pt has h/o colon Ca and recent melanotic stools.
   Guaiac positive brown stool on rectal exam today, followed by witnessed
   large melanotic stool. Now s/p 3units PRBCs transfused, with
   appropriate response in Hct.
   - cont to transfuse PRBCs, goal Hct >30 given demand ischemia
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - follow for further signs of bleeding
   - GI aware of pt, f/u re: possible scopes (pt has been unable to
   undergo scopes in the past given his unstable cardiac status)
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - serial Hcts Q6hrs given bleeding and continued use of ASA/Plavix
   - 2 large-bore PIVs
   - active type-&-cross
   .
   #. CAD - Pt w/ significant CAD hx s/p numerous interventions
   previously. Now w/ CP, worsening ECG findings (ST Depressions),
   uptrending CEs, all e/o NSTEMI.
   - transfusion goal >30
   - cont ASA/Plavix
   - BB as tolerated by BP for rate control
   - holding Heparin / anti-coagulation given GI bleeding
   - follow CEs through peak
   - cont holding other anti-hypertensives given pt's hypotension
   - cont to communicate w/ Cardiology, unlikely to go to cath
   .
   #. Pump - mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferior septal/inferior lateral
   hypokiensis. Known modearte-to-severe aortic valve stenosis (area
   0.9cm2).
   - cont BB as tolerated by BP
   - holding other anti-hypertensives given current hypotension
   - gentle diuresis only as needed
   .
   #. HTN - BB as tolerated by BP, otherwise holding all other
   anti-hypertensives in the setting of hypotension as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient experienced an acute episode of wheezing and distress due to fluid overload after receiving a transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Lasix was administered to diurese the patient, but subsequently, the patient developed abdominal pain, which was likely caused by foley removal and resulting urinary obstruction and retention. Multiple attempts to place a foley catheter failed, possibly due to the patient pulling on it prior to removal and creating multiple tracks. Urology consultation was sought, and a coudee catheter was placed with clear urine return.

2. The patient has known benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), suspected adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and is currently experiencing iron deficiency anemia.

3. Allergies: No known drug allergies.

   depressions on his ECG with a troponin bump, likely [**2-13**] demand
   ischemia.  Troponins have nearly plateaued but no exact peak yet.  More
   obvious is the pt's low hematocrit at 20 on arrival, which is likely
   [**2-13**] GI bleeding as the pt had a witnessed large melanotic stool on the
   floor prior to his hypotension. The pt also had developed chest pain in
   the setting of being transfused, so the hypotension may be [**2-13**]
   transfusion reaction.  However, this is unlikely given his lack of
   hemolytic symptoms.  Path/blood bank is following.
   Most likely, pt is in an already tenuous situation due to his AS, that
   the volume overload associated with the transfusion combined withi his
   anxiety/pain, worsened his respiratory status.  Thinking that his
   decompensation was related to pulm edema, gave pt Lasix and nitro and
   he appropriately responded, giving more credence to this theory.
   At this time, pt is tachy but his pressures are low.  Is a narrow
   therapeutic window for treatment with antihypertensives, including
   lasix and BB.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 97-year-old female with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation (CAD), who presented with symptoms of chest pain, worsening ST depressions on ECG, and pulmonary edema. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload after receiving a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which was likely due to the volume overload associated with the transfusion. 

The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with ongoing melanotic stools, and a witnessed large melanotic stool on the floor prior to the onset of hypotension. This suggests a possible ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleed. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and bladder stones, leading to urinary retention and discomfort. Foley catheterization was attempted but failed due to the patient pulling on the catheter and creating multiple tracks. Eventually, a coude catheter was placed successfully.

The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 20, likely due to the gastrointestinal bleeding. Troponin levels are elevated, suggesting myocardial ischemia or infarction. Other lab results show electrolyte imbalances and abnormalities in kidney function.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/56 mmHg to 160/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress, likely caused by recurrent pulmonary edema secondary to severe chronic systolic heart failure and critical aortic stenosis (AS). The patient received a unit of blood, which led to wheezing and shortness of breath, prompting the removal of his Foley catheter. The catheter was replaced by urology, after which the patient showed improvement.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He is receiving various medications including furosemide, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, atrovent, allopurinol, asa, lipitor, plavix, colace, FeSO4, protonix, lopressor, and others.

His vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax and Tcurrent) of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 98 bpm with a range of 84-115 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 108/57 mmHg to 160/107 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 17-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and anemia. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, likely due to recurrent pulmonary edema caused by severe chronic systolic heart failure and critical aortic stenosis (AS). The patient also has an ongoing gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) and is being followed up with the gastroenterology team.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to recurrent pulmonary edema secondary to severe chronic systolic heart failure and critical AS. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB)/Anemia: The patient has an ongoing GIB, which is contributing to his anemia. Proper management of the GIB is crucial to improve the patient's overall condition.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure/AS: The patient's systolic heart failure and critical AS require careful titration of beta-blockers to optimize cardiac function.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient attempted to remove his Foley catheter and subsequently had it replaced by the urology team. Prophylactic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) have been initiated, and a bladder ultrasound is planned as per urology recommendations. This may indicate a potential UTI or risk of infection due to catheterization.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include respiratory distress due to recurrent pulmonary edema, ongoing GIB contributing to anemia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure/AS, and a potential UTI related to catheterization. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions are essential for the patient's well-being."

   #. Hypotension - Pt transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring and
   care of his hypotension. Hypotension occurred on the floor in the
   setting of multiple possible etiologies. Pt p/w chest pain and has ST
   depressions on his ECG with a troponin bump, likely [**2-13**] demand
   ischemia.  Troponins have nearly plateaued but no exact peak yet.  More
   obvious is the pt's low hematocrit at 20 on arrival, which is likely
   [**2-13**] GI bleeding as the pt had a witnessed large melanotic stool on the
   floor prior to his hypotension. The pt also had developed chest pain in
   the setting of being transfused, so the hypotension may be [**2-13**]
   transfusion reaction.  However, this is unlikely given his lack of
   hemolytic symptoms.  Path/blood bank is following.
   Most likely, pt is in an already tenuous situation due to his AS, that
   the volume overload associated with the transfusion combined withi his
   anxiety/pain, worsened his respiratory status.  Thinking that his
   decompensation was related to pulm edema, gave pt Lasix and nitro and
   he appropriately responded, giving more credence to this theory.
   At this time, pt is tachy but his pressures are low.  Is a narrow
   therapeutic window for treatment with antihypertensives, including
   lasix and BB.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 97-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She presented with worsening chest pain, pulmonary edema, hypotension, and low hematocrit. The patient has undergone multiple interventions and has a history of large melanotic stools, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She also has a history of colon cancer.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, chest pain, ST depressions on ECG, and pulmonary edema. The hypotension is likely due to a combination of factors such as GIB, transfusion reaction, or volume overload. The patient's low hematocrit level indicates ongoing bleeding.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, with significant interventions, and a recent large melanotic stool. She is currently being treated for multiple conditions, including GIB, CAD, and heart failure. She is also being monitored for possible scopes to address the GIB, given her unstable cardiac status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating myocardial injury. Other lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances and acute kidney"

   caused by transfusions, transferred to the MICU for care given
   persistently low BPs.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Pt transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring and
   care of his hypotension. Hypotension occurred on the floor in the
   setting of multiple possible etiologies. Pt p/w chest pain and has ST
   depressions on his ECG with a troponin bump, likely [**2-13**] demand
   ischemia.  Troponins have nearly plateaued but no exact peak yet.  More
   obvious is the pt's low hematocrit at 20 on arrival, which is likely
   [**2-13**] GI bleeding as the pt had a witnessed large melanotic stool on the
   floor prior to his hypotension. The pt also had developed chest pain in
   the setting of being transfused, so the hypotension may be [**2-13**]
   transfusion reaction.  However, this is unlikely given his lack of
   hemolytic symptoms.  Path/blood bank is following.
   Most likely, pt is in an already tenuous situation due to his AS, that
   the volume overload associated with the transfusion combined withi his
   anxiety/pain, worsened his respiratory status.  Thinking that his
   decompensation was related to pulm edema, gave pt Lasix and nitro and
   he appropriately responded, giving more credence to this theory.
   At this time, pt is tachy but his pressures are low.  Is a narrow
   therapeutic window for treatment with antihypertensives, including
   lasix and BB.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 97-year-old male with a history of multiple cardiac interventions, gastrointestinal bleeding, and melanotic stools. He presented with worsening chest pain, pulmonary edema, and hypotension, which led to his transfer to the MICU. The patient has a low hematocrit (Hct) of 20, indicating possible ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. There are multiple potential etiologies for his hypotension, including transfusion reaction, demand ischemia, and volume overload from transfusions. The patient's ECG shows ST depressions consistent with NSTEMI, and his troponin levels are rising, although they have plateaued. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient will be closely monitored in the MICU for his hypotension. A narrow therapeutic window exists for treatment with antihypertensives, including lasix and beta-blockers. Close monitoring of the patient's systolic blood pressure is essential. 

2. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of colon cancer and recent melanotic stools. He is guaiac positive with brown stool and witnessed large melanotic stool. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and responded appropriately with an increase in hematocrit. 

3. CAD: The patient has significant coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous interventions. He now presents with chest pain, worsening ECG findings (ST depressions), and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 97-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple interventions. He presented with worsening chest pain, pulmonary edema, and hypotension. The patient has a low hematocrit level of 20 and has been transfused with multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently on metoprolol. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial ischemia. He has a history of colon cancer and has been experiencing melanotic stools, suggesting ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent low blood pressure requires close monitoring and care. The hypotension could be due to multiple possible etiologies, including demand ischemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of colon cancer and recent melanotic stools, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been transfused with PRBCs to increase his hematocrit level above 30, given the demand ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   97-M w/ CAD s/p multiple interventions and h/o GIB w/ ongoing melanotic
   stools, who p/w worsening chest pain in the setting of Hct 20,
   worsening STd epressions on ECG, and pulm edema [**2-13**] volume overload
   caused by transfusions, transferred to the MICU for care given
   persistently low BPs.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Pt transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring and
   care of his hypotension. Hypotension occurred on the floor in the
   setting of multiple possible etiologies. Pt p/w chest pain and has ST
   depressions on his ECG with a troponin bump, likely [**2-13**] demand
   ischemia.  Troponins have nearly plateaued but no exact peak yet.  More
   obvious is the pt's low hematocrit at 20 on arrival, which is likely
   [**2-13**] GI bleeding as the pt had a witnessed large melanotic stool on the
   floor prior to his hypotension. The pt also had developed chest pain in
   the setting of being transfused, so the hypotension may be [**2-13**]
   transfusion reaction.  However, this is unlikely given his lack of
   hemolytic symptoms.  Path/blood bank is following.
   Most likely, pt is in an already tenuous situation due to his AS, that
   the volume overload associated with the transfusion combined withi his
   anxiety/pain, worsened his respiratory status.  Thinking that his
   decompensation was related to pulm edema, gave pt Lasix and nitro and
   he appropriately responded, giving more credence to this theory.
   At this time, pt is tachy but his pressures are low.  Is a narrow
   therapeutic window for treatment with antihypertensives, including
   lasix and BB.
   - cont close monitoring of pt's SBP
   - given that he is asymptomatic would be hesitant to start a
   vasopressor, esp given his concurrent comorbidities including the GI
   bleeding and demand ischemia
   - treat GI bleeding as below
   - gentle diuresis only as needed if pt becomes SOB from worsening
   pulmonary congestion, as evidenced on physical exam / CXR
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   #. GI bleeding - Pt has h/o colon Ca and recent melanotic stools.
   Guaiac positive brown stool on rectal exam today, followed by witnessed
   large melanotic stool. Now s/p multiple units PRBCs transfused, with
   appropriate response in Hct.
   - cont to transfuse PRBCs, goal Hct >30 given demand ischemia
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - follow for further signs of bleeding
   - GI aware of pt, f/u re: possible scopes (pt has been unable to
   undergo scopes in the past given his unstable cardiac status)
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - serial Hcts Q12hrs given bleeding and continued use of ASA/Plavix but
   stable HCT x 2 tests
   - 2 large-bore PIVs
   - active type-&-cross
   .
   #. CAD - Pt w/ significant CAD hx s/p numerous interventions
   previously. Now w/ CP, worsening ECG findings (ST Depressions),
   uptrending CEs, all e/o NSTEMI.
   - Ideally, transfusion goal >30, however, may consider decreasing goal
   to 28 or 29 given his propensity to decompensate based on small amounts
   of fluid.
   - cont ASA/Plavix
   - BB as tolerated by BP for rate control
   - follow CEs through peak
   - cont to communicate w/ Cardiology, unlikely to go to cath
   .
   #. Pump - mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferior septal/inferior lateral
   hypokiensis. Known modearte-to-severe aortic valve stenosis (area

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 97-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient presented with worsening chest pain, ST depressions on ECG, and pulmonary edema, which led to his transfer to the MICU for closer monitoring and care.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent low blood pressures. There are multiple possible etiologies, including ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, demand ischemia, and transfusion reaction. Close monitoring of the patient's systolic blood pressure is necessary.

2. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of colon cancer and recent melanotic stools, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused and showed an appropriate response in hematocrit (Hct). Continued transfusion of PRBCs is recommended, aiming for a target Hct >30. Serial Hcts every 12 hours should be performed, and an active type & crossmatch is required.

3. CAD: The patient has significant coronary artery disease and previous interventions. Currently, he presents with chest pain, worsening ECG findings (ST depressions), and uptrending cardiac enzymes, suggesting non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It is important to continue antiplatelet therapy with ASA/"

   Assessment and Plan
   GIB/Anemia:  Will try to get final plan from GI.  But likley outpatient
   follow up.  Change to PO PPI
   HOTN/Afib/CAD/acute on chronic systolic HF:  Slightly increased
   troponin today.  Now back in sinus, continue beta blocker.
   GU:  Will follow up with urology on plan for foley, but it will likely
   have to stay in.   No stones found, d/c cipro.
