   24 Hour Events:
   [**2159-7-29**]
   - Coughed up ~10ccs [**Known firstname **] red blood at 11pm.  Morning [**7-30**] coughing up
   small amount dark brown substance.  Larger amount aspirated from NG
   Tube  ? swallowed blood.
   .
   - CT Head obtained, preliminary read:  bilateral basal ganglion
   hypodensity concerning for acute infarction (confirmed with Radiology
   Fellow), bilateral involvement consistent with anoxic event, atleast
   3-4 hours post event; MRI would be helpful if patient stable
   - Given 2L D5 with 150mEq bicarbonate with only minimal improvement in
   urine output; able to wean dopamine significantly but patient became
   bradycardic with complete discontinuation
   - DNR status confirmed with family
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 7 years ago, s/p implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) 5 years ago, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with an acute episode of respiratory distress, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). 

The patient has been on pressors and cooling protocol. There is uncertainty regarding the etiology of the cardiac arrest, with potential sources including primary cardiac or pulmonary issues. The patient has undergone 18 hours of cooling and 6 hours of warming. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure requiring intubation, coronary artery disease with unknown anatomy, a pump function with an ejection fraction of 25%, rhythm disturbances including chronic atrial fibrillation and inappropriate ICD firing, a right-sided apical pneumothorax treated with chest tube placement, asthma exacerbation, renal insufficiency likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, troponin-T, CK-MB, lactate, and liver enzymes. The electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 7 years ago, who presented with acute respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was resuscitated and is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol. The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, with potential sources including a primary cardiac event or a pulmonary source. The patient has been cooled for 18 hours and then rewarmed. There are several medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
2. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's history of asthma and COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure, bronchospasm, pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there may be a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the PEA arrest. There is a risk of worsening renal function or renal failure.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has experienced a hypoxic event, and there is a concern for cerebral hypoxia or anoxic brain injury. Monitoring"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG 7 years ago, ICD implantation 5 years ago, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with an acute episode of respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). The patient is currently on pressors and cooling protocol.

The patient's current condition includes profound acidosis, hypothermia, respiratory failure, possible cardiac versus pulmonary source of PEA arrest, small right-sided pneumothorax, potential renal insufficiency, asthma exacerbation, and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include worsening hypothermia, further respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, worsening renal function, exacerbation of asthma, and potential sepsis due to the presence of blood in the chest tube output."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 7 years ago, s/p implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) 5 years ago, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with acute respiratory distress and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which he received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). He is now on pressors and a cooling protocol.

The patient has had several medical complications since his admission, including:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The cause of the initial PEA arrest is unclear, but it may have been due to a primary cardiac or pulmonary source. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia (cooling) and rewarming.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had difficulty ventilating after intubation, which was likely due to bronchospasm associated with his history of asthma. He has since improved with aggressive bronchodilator therapy.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and underwent CABG, although the anatomy of his coronary arteries is unknown. There is no localized ischemia on the ECGs, but cardiac enzymes are elevated, possibly due to the CPR.

4. Heart Function: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, as seen on a"

   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors
   if no meaningful neurological improvement will discuss withdrawal of
   care - have discussed this plan extensively with wife and son

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG 7 years ago, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with acute respiratory distress, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and subsequent resuscitation. He is now on pressors and cooling protocol. The patient has had multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, and renal insufficiency. He is currently intubated, ventilated, and being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had difficulty ventilating and required aggressive bronchodilator therapy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with concerns for bronchospasm and potential COPD exacerbation.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and s/p CABG. There is uncertainty regarding the cause of his PEA arrest, with possibilities including a primary cardiac event or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac enzymes are elevated, but it is unclear if this is due to ischemia or post-resuscitation injury.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has baseline renal insufficiency with an elevated creatinine level. This may be exacerbated by the recent PEA arrest and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Neurological Dysfunction: The patient has shown minimal neurological improvement, with nonreactive pupils and minimal withdrawal to painful stimuli. There is concern for anoxic brain injury due to the prolonged period of hypoxia.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections due to his prolonged intubation and immunocompromised state.
6. Bleeding: The patient has been coughing up blood and has a chest tube with bloody output. There is a risk of further bleeding and hematologic complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiac function, renal function, neurological status, and infection risks. Frequent assessments of vital signs, blood gases, electrolytes, and daily CXR are necessary. Adjustments to ventilator settings and medication management should be made as needed. The patient's family should be kept informed of his progress and involved in decision-making regarding care and code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and COPD. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress, underwent CPR/ACLS, and is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol. The patient's current condition includes profound acidosis, unclear etiology of cardiac arrest, small right-sided pneumothorax, no evidence of tension, no evidence of hypovolemia, and potential primary cardiac or pulmonary source.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to intubation difficulties, bronchospasm, and concern for bronchospasm on exam. There is also a history of asthma and concern for bronchospasm. The patient's coronary arteries have unknown anatomy, and there is a history of CAD with previous CABG surgery. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is 25%. Additionally, the patient is V-paced and has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation with changing rhythm on telemetry.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including the placement of a right-sided chest tube for a small right apical pneumothorax, with some oozing noted. The patient also has renal insufficiency, with baseline creatinine of 1.2 and likely some component of acute tubular necrosis given the s/p PEA arrest x 2. The patient's urine output is poor.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He has also had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placed in the past. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) were performed. The patient is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol.

The patient has a history of asthma and was intubated due to respiratory failure. He had difficulty ventilating initially but improved with aggressive bronchodilator therapy. The patient is also on a steroid clinical trial.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, but he does not show any localized ischemia on ECGs. His ejection fraction (EF) is 25%, and he has chronic atrial fibrillation.

The patient developed a fever of 101.7°F and has positive leukocytes and moderate bacteria in his urine analysis. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for broad coverage. His chest tube has been inserted for a small right-sided pneumothorax and is currently oozing. The patient's neurologic examination shows some brainstem reflexes intact, and an EEG is pending interpretation.

   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
