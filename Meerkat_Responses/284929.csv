","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous cardiac interventions including CRT/D, CAF, AV ablation, and VT ablation. He presents with a recent heart failure exacerbation and has been treated with increased diuretics. The patient is currently experiencing unstable VT storm and has been placed on V-paced rhythm. His vital signs show mild hypotension, normal heart rate, slightly elevated respiratory rate, and low-grade fever. Physical examination reveals flush in the face, no pallor or cyanosis, and trace pre-tibial edema. His JVP is at 6 cm, and he has a displaced PMI with occasional PVCs. Lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels from 1.5 to 2.6, possibly due to over-diuresis. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased from 1.5 to 2.6, indicating a possible AKI. This could be related to the recent over-diuresis for heart failure exacerbation.
2. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of VT and has experienced a VT storm recently, which required multiple ICD firings. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of mild"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 15%, who underwent CRT/D, CAF, AV ablation, and VT ablation. He presented with VT and multiple ICD firings. The patient has clean coronaries, mild lower extremity edema, and jugular venous distention at 10cm. His creatinine level has increased from 1.5 to 2.6. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing rhythm and is receiving IV amiodarone and lidocaine without events last night. The patient is hemodynamically stable, and his TSH level is elevated at 10 due to acute illness. He is not hyperthyroid, which could contribute to VT. The patient will undergo an EP study and repeat VT ablation today, as well as an ICD battery change during this admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - The patient's creatinine level has increased significantly from 1.5 to 2.6, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This could be due to diuretic use for heart failure or other factors.
2. Heart failure exacerbation - The patient has mild lower extremity edema and jugular venous distention, suggesting fluid overload and potential worsening of heart failure symptoms.
3. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) recurrence - Despite previous VT ablation, the patient experienced VT with multiple ICD firings. There is a risk of VT recurrence during the EP study and ablation procedure.
4. Thromboembolic events - The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation and immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic anticoagulation is being provided.
5. Medication interactions - The patient is on multiple medications, including amiodarone, metoprolol, and mexiletine. There is a risk of drug interactions and side effects.
6. Surgical complications - The planned generator change and EP study carry inherent risks of complications such as infection, bleeding, or adverse reaction to anesthesia."

   Chief Complaint:  ICD firing
   24 Hour Events:
   No areas of dense endocardial scar. RF ablation lesions created from
   the mitral annulus to an area of low voltage in the basal,
   posterolateral wall which was a site of a good pacemap for the clinical
   VT. Ablation at this site terminated the VT, but it still recurred
   severaltimes despite multiple ablations. Several lesions were made from
   this site to create a line to the mitral annulus.  Multiple morphology
   LBBB VTs which most likely have an automatic or triggered mechanism.
   Given this, no further VT ablation planned.  Pt was continued on
   Amiodarone, started on Mexiletine 150 TID per EP.  Warfarin was also
   restarted.
   Had hypotension to high 70s intermittently, pt. asymptomatic, w/
   rebound to 90s (baseline 100s systolic).  Per EP, continued w/

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 15%, and previous cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and multiple ICD firings. 

The patient underwent an attempt at VT ablation yesterday but it was unclear if the presenting VT was adequately targeted. No further plans for epicardial mapping/ablation are currently in place. The patient is on mexiletine and amiodarone for rhythm control.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), with a significant increase in creatinine from 1.6 to 2.8. The cause of ARF is likely due to excess fluid in the setting of heart failure. Diuretics have been initiated to manage fluid overload, and nephrotoxic medications are being held.

Other medical issues include hypertriglyceridemia, for which the patient is already on a home fibrates regimen, and glaucoma, which is being managed with latanoprost and brimonidine eye drops.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/34 mmHg to 107/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination findings include a flushed face, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10 cm, laterally displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and an S3 heart sound at the apex. There are no murmurs or rubs appreciated on cardiac examination. Lung auscultation reveals clear to bilateral lung fields. Abdominal examination shows mild lower extremity edema.

Laboratory values show an increase in creatinine from 1.5 to 2.8, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 43%, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, sodium of 106 mEq/L, chloride of 71 mg/dL, and magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes a generator change today, discontinuation of warfarin due to the upcoming procedure, and continuation of diuretics, beta-blockers, and anticoagulation. The patient is expected to be discharged on spironolactone for heart failure management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), who has undergone CRT/D, CAF, AV ablation, and VT ablation. The patient presented with VT with multiple ICD firings.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension, with intermittent readings in the high 70s and rebounding to the 90s (baseline 100s systolic). The patient is asymptomatic, and metoprolol has been continued as per EP recommendation.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) on CKD, with an FEUrea of 43% and negative urine analysis. The patient is planned for a generator change in the morning, hence being NPO since midnight.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, sulfa (sulfonamides), and meperidine. The patient received infusions of Furosemide (Lasix) at 10:00 AM.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data as of [2132-12-2] 05:59 AM shows stable vital signs, with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/55 mmHg to 107/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently in the ICU following a pacemaker generator change. They experienced a brief episode of hypotension post-procedure that required the use of pressors. Levofloxacin was started as a prophylactic measure for skin infections. The patient awoke at approximately 3 am with sensations in their chest similar to an ICD discharge, despite no events being recorded on telemetry. As a result, amiodarone was increased to 60 mg IV daily. Diuresis was further limited due to borderline systolic blood pressures in the 80s.

The patient underwent an ICD generator change on 24/02/2132 at 08:00 AM. A stool culture was obtained on the same day at 06:46 PM. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, sulfa (sulfonamides), and meperidine. Their last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin, administered on 02/2132 at 06:45 AM.

The patient is currently on various infusions, including furosemide (Lasix) since 12:00 PM. Other medications being administered include changes to medical and family history, with a review of systems unchanged from admission except for the recent episode.

Flow sheet data indicates the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 15%, who underwent CRT/D, CAF, AV ablation, and VT ablation. He presented with symptoms of heart failure exacerbation but showed improvement with increased diuresis. However, his condition deteriorated, leading to hypotension and the need for pressors. His creatinine level increased from 1.5 to 3.0, indicating acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular-paced rhythm, and efforts are being made to stabilize his heart rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic heart failure with increased venous constriction.
2. Acute renal failure due to poor forward flow in acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure.
3. Risk of electrolyte shifts causing further ventricular tachycardia (VT).
4. Possible side effects of medications such as amiodarone, mexiletine, and furosemide.
5. Risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and indwelling lines.
6. Potential complications associated with plasmaphoresis, if recommended by the renal team.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to systemic anticoagulation.
8. Risk of stress ulcers and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. He underwent an ICD generator change, CRT/D, AV ablation, and VT ablation. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension post-procedure requiring pressors. He has been on diuretics for heart failure, but has shown poor response and borderline blood pressures limiting further diuresis. The patient also has an elevated creatinine level indicating acute renal failure. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular-paced rhythm and is being managed with amiodarone and mexiletine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests acute renal failure. This could be due to factors such as dehydration, nephrotoxic medications, or hypotension. It is important to avoid nephrotoxic medications and ensure adequate fluid balance.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of VT and recent VT ablation. There is a possibility of recurrent VT, and it is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of arrhythmia. The patient should continue to have DCCV pads in case of unstable recurrence.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has mild lower extremity edema and an S3 heart sound, indicating ongoing heart"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) who has undergone CRT/D, CAF, AV ablation, and VT ablation. He presents with worsening heart failure symptoms and is currently in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, but he has elevated PCWG and moderate RV dilation with 2+ TR. Renal function is impaired, and the creatinine level has risen from 1.6 to approximately 3.0. There is no evidence of ATN on UA prior to hypotensive episodes. The patient is being treated with dopamine and cautious diuresis to improve cardiac output and kidney perfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure secondary to CHF with a question of mild ATN.
2. Moderate RV dilation with 2+ TR, which can lead to right-sided heart failure.
3. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severely depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF= 15-20%).
4. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation and moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation, contributing to heart failure symptoms.
5. Elevated left atrial pressure and restrictive filling abnormality, indicating diastolic dysfunction.
6. Increased venous constriction, potentially due to systolic heart failure.
7. Hypertriglyceridemia, which may require further management.

   24 Hour Events:
   Patients blood pressures remained adequate throughout the day.  His
   toprol was switched to carvedilol and amioderone was decreased to 200mg
   daily.  Renal was consulted, who felt that patients acute on chronic
   renal failure secondary to CHF with a question of mild ATN.  Feel that
   Cr of 1.6 from 6 months ago likely no longer patients baseline, with
   progressive worsening secondary to HF.  Did not see any indicaiton for
   dialsyis currently, ad recommended gentle diuresis.  Heart Failure
   service was consulted.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] did not feel that patient to be
   signifcantly overloaded, and recommend more maintenence diuresis with
   40mg of torosemide.  A TTE was obtained which showed elevated PCWG and
   moderate RV dilitation with 2+ TR.  Even with these results, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   afraid that aggressively diuresing him with a Lasix drip will result in

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, recent heart failure exacerbation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firings. He presents with symptoms of acute on chronic systolic heart failure and elevated left ventricular filling pressures. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a rise in creatinine from 1.5 to 3.0. There is concern for further deterioration of renal function due to aggressive diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by the increase in creatinine levels. This could be due to various factors such as poor forward flow in the setting of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, or potentially nephrotoxic medications.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of VT and ICD firings. There is ongoing concern for recurrent VT, especially with the current rhythm of atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.
3. Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient's heart failure symptoms have worsened, evidenced by the presence of an S3 heart sound and jugular venous distention (JVD) at 12 cm. There is a need for careful management of diuresis to avoid further fluid shifts and exacerbation of heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), who underwent CRT/D, CAF, and VT ablation. He presented with VT and multiple ICD firings. The patient has clean coronaries on cath. He is currently in the ICU for heart failure exacerbation, with some improvement of symptoms from increased diuresis. His current vitals include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/62 to 112/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on V-paced rhythm due to atrial fibrillation, and his physical examination reveals a flush in the face, displaced PMI, occasional PVCs, paradoxically split S2, no murmurs, lifts, or thrills, and a possible S3 in the left lower sternal border.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, sulfa, and meperidine. He received vancomycin at 06:45 AM. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL and a decreased urine output. His potassium levels are within normal range, but his sodium level is slightly low at 24 mEq/L. His glucose"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (CAF), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. The patient presented with VT and multiple ICD firings.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 117/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and a temperature of 36.1 C. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a JVP of 12 cm, clear breath sounds bilaterally, symmetric chest expansion, and no edema or crackles in the lungs. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. No peripheral edema or jugular venous distention is noted. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show sodium at 137 mg/dL, potassium at 4.1 mEq/L, chloride at 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate at 22 mEq/L, blood urea"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) who has undergone CRT/D, CAF, VT ablation, and ICD implantation. The patient presented with VT and multiple ICD firings. 

The patient has been diagnosed with systolic heart failure with increased venous constriction, as indicated by a JVP of 12cm and an S3 heart sound. There is no prominent lower extremity edema, but the patient is oxygenating well. The patient's baseline creatinine is unclear, but it has improved from 2.8 to 2.4 with the use of milrinone. 

The patient's current medications include torsemide 40mg po bid, metoprolol 12.5mg po bid, mexiletine, and po amiodarone. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.22, indicating acidosis. Other notable lab values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.1-6.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 33.6-35.2%, platelet (Plt) count of 141-174 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 22-33 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.4-2.8 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 137-140 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 3.0-3.6 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 97-102 mEq/L, glucose of 80-217 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) of 7.9-8.4 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.0-2.5 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) of 2.4-3.0 mg/dL, and a prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR) of 25.3-28.6/2.5. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1-36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 69-71 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 111/59-117/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 16-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte imbalances, and infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's cardiac output needs to be improved, and renal function should be closely monitored due to the presence of AKI."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, recent CRT/D, CAF, VT ablation, and ICD firings. He presents with VT with multiple ICD firings. The patient has clean coronaries, an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, and a recent heart failure exacerbation. He is currently in afib with V-paced rhythm and has undergone EP study and repeat VT ablation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 100/43-126/88 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals a flush in the face, supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) at 12 cm, lateralized point of maximal impulse (PMI), occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and a paradoxically split S2. There is a question of an S3 heart sound in the left lower decubitus position (LLDP). No chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis are noted. The abdomen is soft and nontender, with trace pre-tibial edema and 1+ posterior ankle edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) who underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy/direct current cardioversion (CRT/D) and catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia (VT). He presented with VT and multiple ICD firings.
- The patient has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with clean coronaries on catheterization.
- He has a known non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The patient recently experienced a heart failure exacerbation, which improved with increased diuretics. Currently, he has jugular venous distention (JVD) at 12 cm and a third heart sound (S3). However, there is no significant lower extremity edema, and he is oxygenating well. This suggests systolic heart failure with increased venous constriction.
- The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, but his current creatinine is 2.4. He has received intravenous fluids and underwent a ventricular tachycardia ablation study. His blood pressures are borderline, limiting more aggressive diuresis. He would benefit from improved cardiac output and consequent increased forward flow to the kidneys. His creatinine has decreased on milrinone therapy.
- The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing rhythm. He is receiving amiod"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), who underwent CRT/D, CAF, VT ablation, and ICD placement. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and multiple ICD firings. The patient has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with clean coronaries on catheterization. He has been diagnosed with systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 15%. His symptoms have improved with increased diuresis. However, he is still experiencing JVP at 12cm and + S3, indicating increased venous constriction. The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear. He has stable renal function with a creatinine level of 2.5. Digoxin was discontinued, and milrinone was stopped on [**12-7**].

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient has no history of CAD, with clean coronaries on catheterization.
2. Pump: The patient has known non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15%. He has had a recent heart failure exacerbation, which has improved with increased diuresis. Currently, he presents with JVP at 12cm and + S3. However, he is not showing prominent lower extremity (LE) edema and is oxygenating well. He likely has systolic heart failure with increased venous"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), who underwent CRT/D, CAF, and VT ablation. He presented with ventricular tachycardia and had multiple ICD firings. The patient's coronary arteries are clean, and he has no history of CAD. He has an ejection fraction of 15% and experienced a recent heart failure exacerbation. His symptoms have improved with increased diuretics. Currently, he shows signs of systolic heart failure with increased venous constriction, as evidenced by a JVP of 12cm and a positive S3 heart sound. However, there is no prominent lower extremity edema, and he is oxygenating well.

The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, but his current creatinine is stable at 2.5. Digoxin was discontinued, and milrinone was stopped on [12-7]. The patient's blood pressure is borderline, limiting more aggressive diuretic use. There are concerns about renal and heart failure, and the patient would benefit from improved cardiac output and increased forward flow to the kidneys.

The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular-paced rhythm. He is on amiodarone IV and lidocaine, which will be transitioned to oral amiodarone and mexiletine. His thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is"
