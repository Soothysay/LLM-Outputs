   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Unclear source at this point.  He is now
   afebrile after receiving meropenem and tylenol.  Potentially
   superimposed PNA resistant to vanco/zosyn, possible new infectious
   source (e.g. bacteremia).  UA negative for infection.  Doubt CNS source
   as mental status is clearing and FROM in neck, more likely delirium.
   Lactate trending down, WBC trending down.
   - cont vanco (vanco trough 15) and meropenem for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial flutter, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He presented with acute confusion, fever, and leukocytosis after being transferred from a rehabilitation center. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, but the source of infection is unclear. His mental status is improving, and he is no longer febrile. He requires close monitoring for potential complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever and leukocytosis suggests an infectious process. The source of infection is still unclear, and there is a possibility of superimposed pneumonia resistant to vancomycin and zosyn. The patient's condition should be closely monitored for signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxia that is improving. However, due to his underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there is a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and weaning of oxygen therapy as tolerated are necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.4 to 1.8, indicating acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). He was recently admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and presents with acute confusion, fever, and leukocytosis. He has been receiving meropenem and Tylenol, but remains afebrile. The patient has altered mental status, which is improving, and shows signs of pneumonia. He also has chronic systolic CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he has acute on chronic renal failure. He is currently in sinus rhythm, and his diabetes is complicated by peripheral neuropathy. His blood pressure is currently controlled without medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, which may be resistant to the current antibiotics. Further evaluation of the source of infection is necessary, such as obtaining blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures.
2. Delirium: The patient's acute confusion could be attributed to delirium, potentially induced by medications or underlying infections.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's chest X-ray suggests volume overload, which can lead to respiratory distress if not managed appropriately.

   This is a 75 year-old man with CHF, afib on coumadin, diabetes, CAD s/p
   MI, recent admission for PNA, who presents from rehab with altered
   mental status, found to have new fever and leukocytosis.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Unclear source at this point.  She is now
   afebrile after receiving meropenem in the ED and tylenol.  Potentially
   superimposed pna resistant to vanco/zosyn, possible new infectious
   source (e.g. bacteremia).  UA negative for infection.  Doubt CNS source
   as mental status is clearing and FROM in neck, more likely delirium.
   - cont vanco and meropenem for now
   - check vanco level in AM
   - IVF boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/h
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx
   - repeat lactate
   - monitor fever curve, tylenol prn
   - monitor WBC trend

   # Altered mental status:  Likely toxic metabolic in the setting of
   infection.  Also compounded by receiving ativan at the rehab.  Doubt
   meningitis or encephalitis.  Not uremic.  No evidence of liver failure.
   - hold all psychotropic medications
   - keep NPO for now
   - will try haldol if becomes agitated
   - CT head if mental status worsens

   # Hypoxia:  Improving.  Large component likely secondary to undiagnosed
   OSA as pt had witnessed apneic events during initial physical exam.
   Could also be related to pneumonia.  Does not appear to be volume
   overloaded.
   - wean O2 as tolerated, using face mask as pt is mouth breather
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 1.8 from baseline of 1.4.  Likely
   prerenal.
   - IVF bolus
   - monitor UOP and bolus prn for <30cc/h as above

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease who presents with acute confusion, fever, and leukocytosis. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient initially had a fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. After receiving meropenem in the emergency department, the patient's fever resolved.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing acute confusion, which is likely due to a combination of factors including infection and metabolic imbalances. Other potential causes such as meningitis or encephalitis are less likely.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygen levels, likely due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. There is also a possibility of pneumonia contributing to the hypoxia.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.4 to 1.8, indicating worsening renal function. This is likely pre-renal in nature.
5. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%. He is currently appearing dry, indicating potential fluid overload.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial flutter but is currently in sinus rhythm"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial flutter, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction. He was recently admitted for pneumonia and presented with altered mental status, fever, and leukocytosis. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Acute confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to infection or metabolic imbalances.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent pneumonia admission, and there is a possibility of superimposed pneumonia resistant to vancomycin and zosyn. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which could be attributed to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or pneumonia. Oxygen therapy is being provided, and the dosage will be adjusted as necessary.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.4 to 1.8, indicating prerenal failure. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and urine output is being closely monitored.

5. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 15%. Lasix and beta-blockers have been withheld due to possible infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Continued improvement during course of present
   hospitalization suggests drug-induced or toxic-metabolic process.
   Meningitis or encephalitis much less likely.  Avoid psychotropic
   drugs.  Consider head CT in context of elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 8**] have
   underlying OSA or sleep disturbance in context of chronic heart
   failure.  Check ABG if possible to obtain safely.
   PNEUMONIA -- RLL.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent persistent infection (poorly
   responsive to current antimicrobials) or evolution of resistant
   organism.  Adjust antimicrobials, now on Vanco, Meropenem and add
   Azithro.  Monitor exam and radiographs.
   SEPSIS -- may represent partial treatment of pneumonia, or new
   infection (such as C. diff, hepatobiliary infection, skin-infection).
   Plan check cultures.  Continue supportive care, empirical
   antimicrobials.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- reflects hypoperfusion.  Resussitate with fluids,
   monitor lactic acid.  Maintain BP MAP > 60 mmHg.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin, and elevation likely poor
   nutrition and antimicrobial effect.  Monitor to therapeutic level, then
   resume Coumadin.  Reverse (FFP and Vit K) if bleeding develops.
   CHF
 severly depressed EF, but no evidence for active heart failure.
   Monitor I/O, exam.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Likely prerenal due to
   hypovolemia and sepsis.  Replete iv fluids.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   CAD -- No evidence for active disease.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   POTASSIUM -- replete to >4.0 while on Digoxin.
   NIDDM -- maintain glucose <150.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Replete with fluids, monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- adequate rate control.  Continue Amioderone, Digoxin,
   Toprolol.  Monitor HR.
   VEA -- pacer in place.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's medical history includes a variety of conditions, including altered mental status, delirium, pneumonia, sepsis, lactic acidosis, coagulopathy, CHF, acute renal failure, CAD, hypophosphatemia, hyperkalemia, NIDDM, hypovolemia, A-FIB, VEA, and ICU care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia and sepsis, indicating a possible ongoing or recurring infection. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, chest X-ray results, and laboratory values such as white blood cell count would be important in assessing the progression or resolution of these infections.

2. Renal dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be acute on chronic. It is crucial to monitor renal function by checking BUN and creatinine levels regularly and ensuring appropriate fluid management.

3. Bleeding risk: The patient has coagulopathy, likely due to coumadin therapy and malnutrition. Close monitoring of the patient's clotting parameters, such as INR, and being prepared to reverse anticoagulation if significant bleeding occurs are essential.

4. Fluid balance: The patient has hypovolemia, which needs to be addressed by repleting fluids. Monitoring the patient's intake and output (I/O) will help assess the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation.

5. Glycemic control"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have altered mental status, possibly due to a drug-induced or toxic-metabolic process. There are also signs of pneumonia in the right lower lobe, sepsis, lactic acidosis, coagulopathy, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypophosphatemia, hyperkalemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypovolemia, and atrial fibrillation (A-FIB). The patient requires close monitoring and management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug-induced or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The altered mental status could be a result of medication side effects or an imbalance in metabolic processes.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, cough, and infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest a respiratory infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's systemic inflammatory response indicates a possible infection spreading throughout the body.
4. Lactic acidosis: Elevated levels of lactic acid may indicate inadequate oxygenation and tissue hypoperfusion.
5. Coagulopathy: Abnormal bleeding or clotting parameters may be due to poor nutrition, use of anticoagulant medications, or sepsis.
6. Congestive heart failure: Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) suggests compromised cardiac function.
7. Acute renal failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Continued improvement during course of present
   hospitalization suggests drug-induced or toxic-metabolic process.
   Meningitis or encephalitis much less likely.  Avoid psychotropic
   drugs.  Head CT in context of elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 8**] have underlying OSA or
   sleep disturbance in context of chronic heart failure.  ABG
   reassuring.  Improved control with Zyprexa.
   PNEUMONIA -- RLL.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent persistent infection (poorly
   responsive to current antimicrobials) or evolution of resistant
   organism.  Adjust antimicrobials, now on Vanco, Meropenem and Azithro.
   Monitor exam and radiographs.
   SEPSIS -- may represent partial treatment of pneumonia, or new
   infection (such as C. diff, hepatobiliary infection, skin-infection).
   Plan check cultures.  Continue supportive care, empirical
   antimicrobials.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- reflects hypoperfusion.  Resussitate with fluids,
   monitor lactic acid.  Maintain BP MAP > 60 mmHg.  Slow clearance may be
   related to cardiac dysfuntion.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin, and elevation likely poor
   nutrition and antimicrobial effect.  Monitor to therapeutic level, then
   resume Coumadin.  Reverse (FFP and Vit K) if bleeding develops.
   CHF
 severly depressed EF, but no evidence for active heart failure.
   Monitor I/O, exam.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Likely prerenal due to
   hypovolemia and sepsis.  Replete iv fluids.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   CAD -- No evidence for active disease.  Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   POTASSIUM -- replete to >4.0 while on Digoxin.
   NIDDM -- maintain glucose <150.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with altered mental status and agitation. They were unable to provide their medical history due to encephalopathy. The patient has multiple known drug allergies, including sulfa, Lyrica, ace inhibitors, metformin, dofetilide, quinidine, and fentanyl. The patient received several antibiotics over the past day, including meropenem, azithromycin, and vancomycin. They were also given haloperidol and famotidine. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/63 to 133/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is being paced and has a fluid balance of +2,920 mL since midnight.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight status, and no focal neurologic deficits. Their cardiovascular examination is notable for a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and absent S1 heart sound. The respiratory examination shows clear lung sounds bilaterally without wheezing or crackles. The abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds with no distention or tenderness. Extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination shows a sedated patient who is attentive and follows simple commands"

","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient remains disoriented and agitated despite receiving Haldol. Eventually, Zyprexa was given with good effect, suggesting a possible drug-induced or toxic-metabolic process.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia in the right lower lobe. It is unclear whether this represents persistent infection poorly responsive to current antimicrobials or an evolution of a resistant organism. Adjustments to antimicrobials are recommended, including adding Azithromycin.

3. Sepsis: The patient may be experiencing sepsis, which could be related to the pneumonia or a new infection such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff), hepatobiliary infection, or skin infection. Cultures should be checked, and supportive care along with empirical antimicrobials should be continued.

4. Lactic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactic acid levels, indicating hypoperfusion. Fluid resuscitation is recommended to maintain blood pressure and monitor lactic acid levels. Slow clearance may be related to cardiac dysfunction.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, likely attributed to Coumadin and poor nutrition and antimicrobial effect. Monitoring to therapeutic levels is advised, and Coumadin should be resumed. Reverse with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and Vitamin K if"
