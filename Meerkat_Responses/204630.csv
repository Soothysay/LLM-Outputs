158953.0,204630,2159-02-19 18:03:00,Physician ,Physician Attending Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Patient with history of rapidly evolving lung cancer
   was transferred to medical floor following brief [**Hospital Ward Name 51**] ICU stay where
   she was seen for dyspnea.
   Now, on the floor patient has evolved significant tachycardia with
   rhythm of A-fib with rapid ventricular response.
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient with history of ASD repair and complication of sternal wound
   infection.  Lung CA diagnosed on evlauation of dyspnea and back pain
   with chest CT scan showing significant hilar lesions and bronchoscopy
   revealing Large Cell Lung CA.
   24 Hour Events:
   1-A-Fib with Rapid Ventricular Response--Patient did have significant
   evolution of A-Fib with tachcardia to 130 bpm.  Rate control was
   achieved with Diltiazem IV
   2-Respiratory Distress--Patient with recent history of left sided
   complete collapse of lung.  In the setting of A-Fib as above patient
   evolved some worsening hypoxemia requiring increased FIO2 to maintain
   saturations.  Oxygen at 5 lpm at time of transfer.
   Given A-Fib with RVR and further compromise of tenuous respiratory
   status patient to ICU for further care

   shift of structures to right side of midline
   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo female with history of ASD s/p repair now found to have
   substantial burden from Lung CA now identified as Large Cell CA.  She
   has had left sided lung collapse likely secondary to proximal
   obstruction which now has evidence of some shift to right side of chest
   consistent with some evolution of co-existing pleural effusion.  In
   addition onset of A-Fib with RVR has complicated respiratory
   instability.
   1)Atrial Fibrillation-Patient with history of A-fib now with evolution
   of RVR and co-existing respiratory compromise.  Incrased PAP
   intermittent hypoxemia may be current stress.  No evidence of
   Hyperthyroidism or evidence of active ischemia-
   -Dilt gtt started and rate stabilized
   -Will move to po Rx and will need to consider Dilt po given significant
   co-existing lung disease and failure of B-blocker in past.
   -Cardioversion only for hemodynamic compromise
   2)Hypoxemia-Patient with left lung collapse, lung cancer, underlying
   COPD which was not limiting prior and suspicion for but absence of
   documentation of post-obstructive pneumonia
   -Supplemental O2 as needed
   -Right side down
   -Vanco/Zosyn for possible post obstructive pneumonia
   -Would need to evaluate sputum culture and consider bronchoscopy for
   acute worsening
   3)Lung Cancer-large cell, bilateral, rapidly evolving
   -Continued XRT and plans for chemotherapy
   -Will need to consider local airway RX given significant collapse
   distally if not amenable to clearance of secretions alone

","Summary:
- Patient with a history of rapidly evolving lung cancer was transferred to the medical floor.
- The patient is experiencing significant tachycardia with atrial fibrillation (A-fib) and rapid ventricular response (RVR).
- The patient has a history of ASD repair and a complication of a sternal wound infection.
- Lung cancer was diagnosed during evaluation of dyspnea and back pain.
- Chest CT scan showed significant hilar lesions, and bronchoscopy revealed large cell lung cancer.
- The patient developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia, requiring increased FiO2 to maintain saturations.
- Patient's respiratory status worsened, and they were transferred to the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (A-fib with RVR): The patient has evolved significant tachycardia with A-fib and RVR. Rate control was achieved with Diltiazem IV, but further management is required, considering the patient's co-existing lung disease and previous failure of beta-blockers.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient has left lung collapse, lung cancer, underlying COPD, and suspicion for post-obstructive pneumonia. Supplemental O2 is needed, and the patient should be positioned with the right side down. Antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) may be necessary, and a bronchoscopy might be considered for acute worsening.
3. Lung Cancer: The patient has large"

   Pathology [**2-15**]:
   Immunocytochemical studies (S08-6176, S08-6164) show
   positive staining of some of the tumor cells with
   pan-keratin (AE1-3/Cam 5.2), cytokeratin 7 and synaptophysin
   and negative staining of the tumor cells with TTF-1,
   cytokeratin 20, chromogranin and LCA. These findings
   supports the diagnosis. Based on morphologic features, a
   large cell carcinoma is favored.
   CXR [**2-19**]:
   There continues to be complete opacification of the left hemithorax, [**Doctor Last Name **]
   though
   the patient is mildly rotated.  There appears to be mild shifting of th
   e
   cardiac silhouette towards the right side suggesting increase in left p
   leural
   effusion.  There is no right pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion
   .  Left
   PICC remains in place.  There is no evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with paroxysmal Afib and new diagnosis of mediastinal [**Hospital **]
   transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR:
   Patient has known paroxysmal Afib.  Current episode most likely
   triggered by hypoxia.  Less likely to be due to ischemic event as EKG
   and cardiac enzymes negative.  TSH is normal.
   -          continue PO diltiazem; increase as tolerated by BP
   -          would not anticoagulate with heparin or coumadin at present
   given concern for bleed from mediastinal mass
   -          will discuss with IP if patient is candidate for stent; if
   no, would start ASA
   -          appreciate cardiology input
   # Hypoxia:
   Patient has obstruction of bronchus with collapse of left hemithorax
   and associated pleural effusion.  She is also thought to have
   post-obstructive pneumonia, although she has not developed fevers,
   leukocytosis, or positive sputum Cx.  Fluid overload may also play a
   role given that she has been receiving IV fluids for tumor lysis
   syndrome prophylaxis.
   -          Will discuss with IP whether patient is candidate for stent
   (per bronch report, obstruction is from outside the bronchus)
   -          treat possible PNA with vanc, zosyn for total of 10 day
   course (day 1 of both = [**2-13**])
   -          CXR currently without pulmonary edema; moreover, would not
   want to drop BP with lasix while up-titrating diltiazem.  Hold on
   diuresis for now.
   # Hilar mass:
   Prelim pathology suggestive of large cell carcinoma.
   -          f/u final pathology
   -          appreciate Rad/Onc recs
   -          follow tumor lysis labs (LDH, uric acid) [**Hospital1 **]
   -          patient has recent Echo with EF 60% in case adriamycin
   treatment indicated
   -          MRI with 2 liver lesions; CT head without mets
   # Metabolic alkalosis
   Multifactorial in setting of receiving bicarb for tumor lysis, GI
   losses (diarrhea), and diuresis.
   -          holding bicarb
   -          hold lasix because of concern for dropping BP as discussed
   above
   # HTN
   -          increasing diltiazem as tolerated by BP
   # C Diff
continue po vancomycin for total of 2 week course since

   Pathology [**2-15**]:
   Immunocytochemical studies (S08-6176, S08-6164) show
   positive staining of some of the tumor cells with
   pan-keratin (AE1-3/Cam 5.2), cytokeratin 7 and synaptophysin
   and negative staining of the tumor cells with TTF-1,
   cytokeratin 20, chromogranin and LCA. These findings
   supports the diagnosis. Based on morphologic features, a
   large cell carcinoma is favored.
   CXR [**2-19**]:
   There continues to be complete opacification of the left hemithorax, [**Doctor Last Name **]
   though
   the patient is mildly rotated.  There appears to be mild shifting of th
   e
   cardiac silhouette towards the right side suggesting increase in left p

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with paroxysmal Afib and new diagnosis of mediastinal [**Hospital **]
   transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR:
   Patient has known paroxysmal Afib.  Current episode most likely
   triggered by hypoxia.  Less likely to be due to ischemic event as EKG
   and cardiac enzymes negative.  TSH is normal.
   -          continue PO diltiazem; increase as tolerated by BP
   -          appreciate cardiology input
   # Hypoxia:
   Patient has obstruction of bronchus with collapse of left hemithorax
   and associated pleural effusion.  She is also thought to have
   post-obstructive pneumonia, although she has not developed fevers,
   leukocytosis, or positive sputum Cx.  Fluid overload may also play a
   role given that she has been receiving IV fluids for tumor lysis
   syndrome prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a new diagnosis of mediastinal cancer. She was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has borderline tachycardia. Her physical examination reveals a sternal wound with brown eschar, mild erythema, no induration or fluctuance, absent breath sounds on the left side, diminished breath sounds on the right with mid-inspiratory crackles, soft abdomen, and no edema in the extremities. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal complete opacification of the left hemithorax with mild shifting of the cardiac silhouette towards the right side, suggesting an increase in left pleural effusion. The patient's pathology results indicate large cell carcinoma. The patient's assessment includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxia, post-obstructive pneumonia, fluid overload, metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and Clostridium difficile infection. The plan involves treating possible post-obstructive pneumonia, continuing prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and providing full code"

   Imaging: CXR yesterday with left sided collapse and mediastinal shift
   to right
   Bedside u/s performed - has small left pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o F with newly diagnosed lung cancer, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   afib with RVR, now improved on oral diltiazem.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Improved rate control on diltiazem.  TTE
   this admission did not show any pericardial disease, so likely has afib
   as a result of atrial stretch from her ASD.  Would hold systemic
   anticoagulation given her risk of bleeding from mass with XRT, but
   would at least start aspirin.  However, will first discuss with IP and
   make sure she does not need further procedures.
 HYPOXEMIA:  Initially treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with
   vanc and zosyn.  She does not have a new fever or increased secretions
   to suggest HAP, so will continue her current antibiotics for empiric 10
   day course.  The collapse will hopefully respond to XRT.  Will discuss
   with IP whether they think she is amenable to stent.
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC:  Likely due to bicarbonate she was receiving in
   anticipation of tumor lysis.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER:  Likely large cell lung Ca per

   Imaging: CXR yesterday with left sided collapse and mediastinal shift

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o F with newly diagnosed lung cancer, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   AFib with RVR, now improved on oral diltiazem.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Improved rate control on diltiazem.  TTE
   this admission did not show any pericardial disease, so likely has afib
   as a result of atrial stretch from her ASD vs. from the metabolic load
   of tumor.  Begin aspirin given high stroke risk.  Will discuss with IP
   and make sure she does not need further procedures, then consider
   additional anticoagulation.
 HYPOXEMIA:  Initially treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with
   vanc and zosyn.  She does not have a new fever or increased secretions
   to suggest HAP, so will continue her current antibiotics for empiric 10
   day course.  The collapse will hopefully respond to XRT.  Will discuss
   with IP whether they think she is amenable to stent.
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC:  Likely due to bicarbonate she was receiving in
   anticipation of tumor lysis.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER:  Likely large cell lung cancer
   with neuroendocrine features, per preliminary reports.  Getting XRT.
   Chemo decision is pending final pathology.  Oncology following.
 COPD:  Cont spiriva and advair.  Not wheezing currently.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), large cell lung cancer, post-obstructive pneumonia (pna), and obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU due to recurrent AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was treated with diltiazem drip. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm and blood pressure of 143/68 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and her SpO2 is 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes chest physiotherapy (PT), nebulizers (nebs), and suctioning.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), with normal hemoglobin (Hct) and creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level (K+). Other lab values, including liver enzymes and cardiac markers, are within normal limits. Imaging shows a white-out left lung with volume loss, consistent with the known large cell lung cancer. The ECG shows AFib with RVR, but without evidence of ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of AFib, which"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female who underwent an atrial septal defect repair and has a history of large cell lung cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 150 bpm, blood pressure of 101/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and she is on diltiazem infusion at 15 mg/hour.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), hypoxemia, metabolic alkalosis, benign hypertension, and Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis). She is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 43200/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 116 mg/dL, creatinine at 1.1 mg/dL, potassium at 4.2 mEq/L, sodium at 137 mEq/L, chloride at 29.0%, bicarbonate at 6.4 K/uL, and magnesium at 2.3 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 1414 IU/L, low troponin-T levels, and normal calcium and phosphate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, crackles in the right lower lung base, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and attentive mental status. The patient is not experiencing chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, or pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, hypoxemia, C. diff infection, and the patient's underlying malignancy. The patient's large cell lung cancer may progress and lead to further complications. Additionally, the patient's metabolic alkalosis needs to be monitored and managed appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Likely provoked by lung malignancy versus post-obstructive pneumonia.
   No evidence of pericardial/cardiac malignant disease on recent imaging.
   However given apparent aggressive pace of her pulmonary malignancy will
   repeat TTE to reassess for evidence of pericardial mets that may be
   provoking afib.
   Rate remains inadequately controlled on diltiazem drip. Increase PO
   diltiazem today and continue diltiazem drip. Will review this choice
   with oncology re potential for interaction  with future chemotherapy
   (e.g. anthracyclines). Start heparin for anticoagulation, recognizing
   risk of bleeding related to malignancy. If patient has any evidence of
   bleeding (e.g. hemoptysis) will discontinue heparin.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Clinically good response to zosyn and vancomycin with no leukocytosis
   and resolved fevers, though still with impressive opacification L
   hemithorax. Would add ciprofloxacin for double gram negative coverage.
   As post-obstructive etiology sputum cx likely low yield
 in any case
   patient has been on broad spectrum abx for >1 week.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Pathology prelim c/w large cell with neuroendocrine features. Oncology
   recommendations appreciated.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   On diltiazem as above.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vancomycin complete 14day course following end of broad
   spectrum antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Likely provoked by lung malignancy versus post-obstructive pneumonia.
   No evidence of pericardial/cardiac malignant disease on recent imaging.
   However given apparent aggressive pace of her pulmonary malignancy will
   repeat TTE to reassess for evidence of pericardial mets that may be
   provoking afib.
   Rate remains inadequately controlled on diltiazem drip. Increase PO
   diltiazem today and continue diltiazem drip. Will review this choice
   with oncology re potential for interaction  with future chemotherapy
   (e.g. anthracyclines). Start heparin for anticoagulation, recognizing
   risk of bleeding related to malignancy. If patient has any evidence of
   bleeding (e.g. hemoptysis) will discontinue heparin.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Clinically good response to zosyn and vancomycin with no leukocytosis
   and resolved fevers, though still with impressive opacification L
   hemithorax. Would add ciprofloxacin for double gram negative coverage.
   As post-obstructive etiology sputum cx likely low yield
 in any case
   patient has been on broad spectrum abx for >1 week.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Pathology prelim c/w large cell with neuroendocrine features. Oncology
   recommendations appreciated.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   On diltiazem as above.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vancomycin complete 14day course following end of broad
   spectrum antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year-old woman returns to ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR in
   the setting of complete lung collapse from large cell lung cancer with
   neuroendocrine features (presumptive)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - continue diltiazem gtt
   - discuss with oncology whether drug interactions would prohibit
   amiodarone
   - if not, amio load since we are not achieving adequate rate control at
   present
   - repeat echocardiogram to exclude new pericardial disease
 ANTICOAGULATION RISK
   She has substantial risks for stroke, PE, and airway bleeding.  Given
   the debilitating nature of embolic strokes, and her high risk for such
   an event, we will give a trial of anticoagulation.  If she has any
   airway bleeding, would then stop.  If her tumor erodes  and causes
   communication between aiway and PA (which is possible), then whether
   anticoagulation is present or not will not affect outcome since such an
   event would be fatal.  Overall, then, the benefits of a trial of
   anticoagulation outweigh risks in this circumstance.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of large cell lung cancer, admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She has a complete lung collapse due to the cancer. The patient is currently on diltiazem for rate control, but it is not adequately controlling her heart rate. Anticoagulation therapy has been initiated due to her high risk of stroke and pulmonary embolism, despite the potential risk of airway bleeding. Antibiotics have been prescribed for a possible postobstructive pneumonia. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are planned for her cancer treatment. The patient also has C. difficile infection, for which oral vancomycin has been given. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Stroke: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation, which can lead to a stroke if the clot travels to the brain.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: Anticoagulation therapy has been initiated due to the patient's high risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.

3. Airway Bleeding: The patient is at risk of airway bleeding, especially if her tumor erodes and causes communication between the airway and pulmonary artery.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has postobstructive pneumonia, which requires antibiotic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of cancer undergoing radiation therapy. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition. The patient has several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation (AF), pneumonia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 118/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 5 liters of nasal cannula. The patient is awake and throwing up small amounts of clear liquid. Physical examination reveals no breath sounds in the left lung, a warm extremity without edema, and distal pulses bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Kidney function is normal, but liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium. Imaging studies show mild dilatation of the left atrium, normal left ventricular function, and mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, cancer, hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and C."

   and Afib with RVR.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   In setting of hypoxia, mediastinal malignancy, and possible
   dehydration.  Not felt to be ischemic in setting of normal cardiac
   enzymes.  TSH normal.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a preliminary diagnosis of large cell lung cancer. She is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pneumonia, and cancer. She has undergone radiation therapy and is scheduled for chemotherapy. The patient's symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which are likely due to compression of the esophagus and possibly the involvement of chemotherapy. She has been on various medications such as amiodarone, diltiazem, heparin, lorazepam, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 118/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 5L NC. Her lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and glucose, while her creatinine and potassium levels are within normal range. The echocardiogram shows mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, as well as mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ischemic stroke: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases the risk of blood clots forming in the heart, which can then travel to the brain and cause an ischemic stroke.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. He presents with nausea, vomiting, and hypoxemia. The patient has been receiving radiation therapy and has a PICC line inserted. His vital signs show a heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 118/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 5L NC. The patient is awake and throwing up small amounts of clear liquid. Physical examination reveals no significant findings except for absent breath sounds in the left lung and warm extremities without edema or dependent rubor. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 446 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and decreased platelet count of 12 K/uL. Blood chemistry reveals elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and sodium level of 28 mEq/L. The patient's liver enzymes (AST, ALT) are within normal range. An echocardiogram shows mild dilatation of the left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, good systolic function, and mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. There is also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, cancer, atrial fibrillation, nausea/vomiting, and potential metabolic alkalosis. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis, H2 blocker for stress ulcer, and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has a history of cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. The patient is experiencing shortness of breath with activity, constipation, and concerns about her prognosis and chemotherapy specifics. She also has allergies to tetracycline, yeast infection, and a rash from a metal can/brush top applicator.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/82 to 97/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,790 mL and output of 3,130 mL, with a negative balance of 340 mL. She is receiving IV fluids for hypercalcemia and poor oral intake.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is awake, oriented, and pale. Her lungs show absent breath sounds on the left side and crackles on the left. Her abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or distention. There is no lower extremity edema, but she has pneumatic boots in place with dorsalis pedis pulses of +2 bilaterally.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/u"

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with new malignancy, probable large cell carcinoma, hypoxia,
   and Afib with RVR.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   In setting of hypoxia and mediastinal malignancy.  Thought to be
   dehydrated yesterday, but patient
s response to fluid challenge was to
   increase her urine output, suggesting that she is in fact euvolemic.
   TSH normal.  No evidence for ischemia.
   -          currently on diltiazem gtt; will wean if possible, but will
   not try to be aggressive with decreasing dilt given tenuous control of
   HR
   -          s/p amiodarone IV load, dc
d per cardiology recs
   -          continue to titrate up PO metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          anticoagulate with heparin gtt
   -          appreciate cardiology recs
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Postobstructive
   -          continue vanc and zosyn for total of 2 week course (day 1 =
   [**2-13**]; last day to treat = [**2-26**])
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Prelim diagnosis is large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
   Probably liver metastases.
   -          per oncology, plan to initiate chemotherapy today in setting
   of rapid progression of tumor
   -          plan to start taxol and carboplatin today
   -          will watch for potential toxicities:  taxol
anaphylaxis
   (would give more IV steroid), bradycardia; carboplatin
acute renal
   failure
   -          will start G-CSF tomorrow
   -          appreciate rad/onc input (per oncology, plan will be to
   continue XRT)
 HYPERCALCEMIA (HIGH CALCIUM)
   -          awaiting PTHrp
   -          Calcium improved with IV fluids
   -          Will check ionized calcium given that albumin is low, so
   total calcium is likely to be underestimation of extent of
   hypercalcemia
   -          No indication for pamidronate at this time
 HYPOXEMIA
   -          patient has obstruction of left main bronchus with collapsed
   left lung
   -          not a candidate for stenting per IP
   -          monitor daily CXR
 NAUSEA / VOMITING
   -          likely to be from compression of esophagus, though
   constipation may contribute
   -          likely to worsen with initiation of chemotherapy
   -          zofran and compazine
   -          KUB without evidence of obstruction
   -          Bowel regimen
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   -          diltiazem, beta blocker
   # C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   -          continue PO vanc for 14 day course after IV vanc/zosyn
   stopped
   -          not currently having diarrhea

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a new malignancy, likely large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features, and hypoxia. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and is currently on diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control. She is also receiving heparin for anticoagulation. The patient has pneumonia, possibly due to postobstructive causes, and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She has hypercalcemia, which has improved with IV fluids, and is awaiting further evaluation for parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). The patient has hypoxia due to obstruction of the left main bronchus with collapsed left lung and is not a candidate for stenting. She also has constipation and is likely to worsen with the initiation of chemotherapy. The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with diltiazem and beta-blockers. She has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and is on a bowel regimen. The patient is receiving regular diet with ensure but has poor oral intake. Her blood glucose levels have been monitored and are within normal range. She has multiple lines, including a PICC line, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is ICU.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   In setting of hypoxia and mediastinal malignancy.  Thought to be
   dehydrated yesterday, but patient
s response to fluid challenge was to
   increase her urine output, suggesting that she is in fact euvolemic.
   TSH normal.  No evidence for ischemia.
   -          currently on diltiazem gtt; will wean if possible, but will
   not try to be aggressive with decreasing dilt given tenuous control of

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Prelim diagnosis is large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
   Probably liver metastases.
   -          per oncology, plan to initiate chemotherapy today in setting
   of rapid progression of tumor
   -          plan to start taxol and carboplatin today
   -          will watch for potential toxicities:  taxol

   -          awaiting PTHrp
   -          Calcium improved with IV fluids
   -          Will check ionized calcium given that albumin is low, so
   total calcium is likely to be underestimation of extent of
   hypercalcemia
   -          No indication for pamidronate at this time
 HYPOXEMIA
   -          patient has obstruction of left main bronchus with collapsed

   Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] was seen and examined with the ICU team; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**]
   note reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that she continues to
   have fairly difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation, but that her
   respiratory status remains stable.  We appreciated oncology
s help, and
   understand that they are planning to begin systemic therapy today.
   Cardiology
s help is also appreciated, and we have stopped the
   amiodarone for now and are focusing on nodal agents for rate control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a new malignancy, probable large cell carcinoma, hypoxia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. The patient's current medications include diltiazem, metoprolol, heparin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She is also scheduled to start chemotherapy with taxol and carboplatin today. The patient has concerns about her prognosis and the specifics of her chemotherapy. She reports feeling short of breath with activity and still experiences constipation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR needs to be closely monitored and managed. Diltiazem and metoprolol are being used for rate control. The patient's response to these medications will determine the next steps in management.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has an obstruction of the left main bronchus with collapsed left lung, causing hypoxia. Stenting may not be an option due to the location of the tumor. Monitoring daily chest X-rays will help assess any changes.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which has improved with IV fluids. Further evaluation for PTHrP is pending. Ionized calcium levels should be checked due to low albumin"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   In setting of hypoxia and mediastinal malignancy.  Thought to be
   dehydrated yesterday, but patient
s response to fluid challenge was to
   increase her urine output, suggesting that she is in fact euvolemic.
   TSH normal.  No evidence for ischemia.
   -          currently on diltiazem gtt; will wean if possible, but will
   not try to be aggressive with decreasing dilt given tenuous control of
   HR
   -          s/p amiodarone IV load, dc
d per cardiology recs
   -          continue to titrate up PO metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          anticoagulate with heparin gtt
   -          appreciate cardiology recs
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Postobstructive
   -          continue vanc and zosyn for total of 2 week course (day 1 =
   [**2-13**]; last day to treat = [**2-26**])
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Prelim diagnosis is large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
   Probably liver metastases.
   -          per oncology, plan to initiate chemotherapy today in setting
   of rapid progression of tumor
   -          plan to start taxol and carboplatin today
   -          will watch for potential toxicities:  taxol
anaphylaxis
   (would give more IV steroid), bradycardia; carboplatin
acute renal
   failure
   -          will start G-CSF tomorrow
   -          appreciate rad/onc input (per oncology, plan will be to
   continue XRT)
 HYPERCALCEMIA (HIGH CALCIUM)
   -          awaiting PTHrp
   -          Calcium improved with IV fluids
   -          Will check ionized calcium given that albumin is low, so
   total calcium is likely to be underestimation of extent of
   hypercalcemia
   -          No indication for pamidronate at this time
 HYPOXEMIA
   -          patient has obstruction of left main bronchus with collapsed
   left lung
   -          not a candidate for stenting per IP
   -          monitor daily CXR
 NAUSEA / VOMITING
   -          likely to be from compression of esophagus, though
   constipation may contribute
   -          likely to worsen with initiation of chemotherapy
   -          zofran and compazine
   -          KUB without evidence of obstruction
   -          Bowel regimen
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   -          diltiazem, beta blocker
   # C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   -          continue PO vanc for 14 day course after IV vanc/zosyn
   stopped
   -          not currently having diarrhea

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   At rest, rate control is improved though tachycardic with stimulation.
   Likely has irritable atria secondary to her extensive mediastinal and
   pulmonary disease. Continue diltiazem PO and drip, and increase
   metoprolol PO further today. Has received IV amiodarone load, will
   discuss further with cardiology regarding PO amiodarone. On IV heparin
   for anticoagulation.
 Postobstructive pneumonia
   Afebrile, not coughing. Complete 14 day course of empiric vancomycin
   and zosyn last day [**2-26**].
 Lung cancer
   Prelim diagnosis is large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
   Probably liver metastases. s/p bronchoscopy with extraluminal
   compression L side, not a candidate for stenting per IP.
   Being treated with radiation and now s/p first dose of taxol and
   carboplatin. Watch for potential chemotherapy-related toxicities
   taxol
anaphylaxis (would give more IV steroid), bradycardia;
   carboplatin
acute renal failure. Discuss neupogen plans with oncology.
   Plan for next dose radiation next week.
 HYPERCALCEMIA (HIGH CALCIUM)
   Ca improved following IVFs, phos recently in normal range though low
   today likely nutritional. PTH-RP pending. Discuss bisphosphonate with
   oncology.
 Confusion
   Seems improved today
 may be secondary to poor sleep, medications
   (e.g. compazine), infection, metabolic disturbances (e.g.
   hypercalcemia). No evidence of CNS mets on scan. Follow.
 HYPOXEMIA
   Likely multifactorial in setting of extensive malignancy, likely
   post-obstructive pneumonia, and evidence of edema on chest film. Will
   diurese today goal -1L negative as BP tolerates.
 NAUSEA / VOMITING
   Resolved, ok to continue prn antiemetics. No evidence of intracranial
   mets on [**2-14**] CT head with contrast, no evidence of obstruction on KUB.
 HYPERTENSION
   On diltiazem and metoprolol. BP under adequate control.
 h/o C. difficile colitis
   Afebrile with benign abdominal exam, no diarrhea. Complete 14 day
   course of PO vancomycin following discontinuation of broad spectrum

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial septal defect repair, recent shortness of breath, and a new diagnosis of large primary lung cancer, stage III. She is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient has no change in neuro exam and has post-obstructive pneumonia. She has allergies to tetracycline and yeast infection. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 123/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. She is on various medications including carboplatin, taxol, heparin sodium, diltiazem, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent onset shortness of breath. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, which indicates an infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is slightly low at 95% on supplemental oxygen. If not adequately managed, this can result in inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organs.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a high calcium level. If not treated promptly, hypercalcemia can lead to various complications such as kidney damage,"

   -          Complete 14 day course of empiric vancomycin and zosyn last
   day [**2-26**].
 Lung cancer - Prelim diagnosis is large cell carcinoma with
   neuroendocrine features.  Probably liver metastases. s/p bronchoscopy
   with extraluminal compression L side, not a candidate for stenting per
   IP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with large cell lung cancer, left lung collapse, atrial fibrillation, and worsening respiratory status. She experienced prolonged respiratory decompensation with increased work of breathing, dropping SaO2 with increasing O2 requirement, and altered mental status/delirium. The patient was treated with Lasix, morphine, nebs, steroids, and BiPAP. She required sedation with Ativan and Haldol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient likely has irritable atria secondary to her extensive mediastinal and pulmonary disease. She is on a diltiazem drip but has poor control now that she is not taking oral medication (off po dilt). The concern is that metoprolol may be causing bronchospasm, but it will continue to be dosed IV. The patient previously received IV amiodarone, but it was discontinued per cardiology advice. They will discuss further regarding restarting amiodarone today.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial in the setting of extensive malignancy, post-obstructive pneumonia, and evidence of worsening edema on chest film. She is unable to tolerate further duresis given the rise in creatinine. There are no EKG changes to explain decompensation, and it is unlikely that the cause is pulmonary embolism since"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with large cell cancer. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 148 bpm, blood pressure of 133/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of pneumonia, cancer, hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, hypertension, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat. This increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics. If the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are ineffective, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, indicating inadequate oxygen levels in the blood. This can result in tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which can affect various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function. If left untreated, it can lead to kidney damage and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Cancer: The patient's large cell cancer requires ongoing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing various health issues. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation but it was stopped after a short period of time. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (114 bpm) and blood pressure (104/78 mmHg). The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF), which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can lead to poor blood flow. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and glucose. The patient also has an increased white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. The troponin-T level is normal, indicating no cardiac injury. The lactic acid level is slightly elevated, and the albumin level is below normal. Other lab results such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, LDH, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal range.

The patient has multiple diagnoses including pneumonia, cancer, hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, hypertension, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and others. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including antibiotics, anticoagulants,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a diagnosis of large cell lung cancer and liver metastasis. She has been admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she was receiving diltiazem and amiodarone infusions. She also has pneumonia, possibly post-obstructive given her underlying malignancy. The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, considering her extensive mediastinal and pulmonary disease, as well as worsening edema seen on chest x-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a known history of AFIB, which is worsening with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Her irritable atria may be due to extensive mediastinal and pulmonary disease.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including post-obstructive pneumonia, extensive malignancy, and worsening edema on chest x-ray. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation but requires further management.

3. Pneumonia, Other: The patient has postobstructive pneumonia, which was treated with empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, the course is now complete, and there is a concern for other types of pneumonia.

4. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Other: The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation but was later switched to biPAP due to agitation and pulling at the mask.
- The patient became increasingly somnolent during the night and is now minimally conversant.
- The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/78 mmHg to 151/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature of 36.1°C.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, and their lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, troponin T, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, and magnesium levels. Other lab results are within normal range.
- The patient has pneumonia, cancer, hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient is on various medications including amiodarone, diltiazem, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and others.
- The patient has a PICC line in place for ICU care.
- The patient's code status is comfort measures only.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and elevated LDH level suggest a possible pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, administer appropriate antibiotics, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including wound infection after ASD repair, large cell lung cancer with neuroendocrine features, recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pneumonia, and malignant neoplasm. She has been transitioned to comfort measures due to her condition. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low oxygen saturation, and fluctuating blood pressure. She has been on non-invasive ventilation, amiodarone, and morphine for comfort. The patient's laboratory results indicate hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging studies show multiple lung masses with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and compromised lung function.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias, including recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
3. Hypoxemia and respiratory distress due to low oxygen saturation.
4. Infection and sepsis due to wound infection and elevated white blood cell count.
5. Hypercalcemia and its associated complications, such as renal dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Malignant neoplasm progression and metastasis.
7. C. difficile infection due to antibiotic use.
8. Nausea, vomiting, and poor glycemic control due to morphine use for comfort measures.
9. Pressure ulcers and skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility.

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history including sternal wound infection post ASD repair, newly diagnosed large cell lung cancer with post-obstructive pneumonia, and recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was previously on non-invasive ventilation but switched to amio gtt for a rapid heart rate. She then became acutely dyspneic with decreased breath sounds on the right side and trialed bipap but became agitated, requiring restraints. The patient's code status was changed to comfort measures only after a family meeting yesterday, with no further lab checks.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 C, heart rate of 147 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/85 to 151/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient is currently on amiodarone infusion and other ICU medications including morphine sulfate and lorazepam.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose level ranging from 105 to 175 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a history of malignancy and current symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib), respiratory failure, and cancer. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 156 bpm, blood pressure of 104/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is irregular and tachycardic at around 150 beats per minute. The patient has been receiving comfort measures only (CMO) due to their condition, but this decision has been reversed back to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) based on the patient's improved alertness. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and has a history of malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in AFib with a rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the 150s. This can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, and an increased risk of stroke if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, indicating potential respiratory distress. This could be due to the underlying malignancy or other factors contributing to respiratory failure.
3. Malignancy: The patient has a history of malignancy, which may be causing systemic effects and contributing to the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI pending evaluation by radiation oncology to determine eligibility for palliative radiation therapy. The patient is alert and requesting breakfast without any complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Medications have been discontinued, including amiodarone and diltiazem.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 156 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 104/66 to 109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is irregular and tachycardic in the 150s, making it difficult to appreciate any murmurs or gallops.

Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general, head/eyes/nose/throat, or neurologic assessments. However, there is a CTAB lesion over the left lung base. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. No other external findings are noted.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count at 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin at 8.8 g/dL, sodium at 142 mg/dL, potassium at 3.8 mEq/L, creatinine at 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and respiratory failure. She was previously on do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status but has been changed back to full code status. The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure due to a bulky pulmonary tumor burden, hypercalcemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently receiving palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 156 bpm, blood pressure of 104/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, but normal platelet count, creatinine, and troponin levels. The patient is receiving appropriate medications for her conditions and is currently on a regular oral diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to the bulky pulmonary tumor burden encasing the left mainstem bronchus and left lobe collapse. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications like pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU. He was previously on comfort measures only status but has now resumed full code status per discussions with hem/onc & palliative XRT. The patient is experiencing tachycardia and irregularly irregular rhythm due to atrial fibrillation. He has a history of pneumonia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), hypercalcemia (high calcium), hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is receiving diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control and has been restarted on his diet. He is being closely monitored in the ICU for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregularly irregular rhythm indicates atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which can worsen if not treated adequately and may lead to respiratory failure or sepsis.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can cause complications like renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which can be caused by underlying lung conditions like pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory distress and organ damage.

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a diagnosis of large cell lung cancer and left lung collapse. She was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and worsening respiratory status requiring intubation. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently extubated and stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula without respiratory distress. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol. She has a history of cancer, which is currently being treated with radiation therapy, and she is scheduled to receive 10 more treatments. The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection, for which she has been restarted on a 14-day course of vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a heart rate of 122 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 109/66 to 137/86 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an intake of 418 mL and output of 1340 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 922 mL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history including post-obstructive pneumonia, large cell lung cancer, recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, sternal wound infection post ASD repair, and fatigue. The patient has received treatment for pneumonia, but her condition is still unstable with ongoing respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is currently stable on nasal cannula oxygen but may require increased support if her respiratory status worsens.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient has high calcium levels which need to be monitored and managed to prevent complications such as renal dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has completed treatment for C. difficile infection, but she is at risk for recurrence due to antibiotic use.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control is improving with metoprolol and digoxin, but further management is required to prevent thromboembolic events or heart failure.
5. Large cell lung cancer: The patient has been diagnosed with large cell lung cancer and is currently undergoing palliative radiation therapy. The next steps in cancer management, such as chemotherapy or further radiation therapy, need to be discussed with the oncology and radiation oncology services.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed to optimize the patient's clinical outcome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history including post-obstructive pneumonia, large cell lung cancer, and recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has a sternal wound infection following ASD repair and is now receiving palliative radiation therapy. The patient's mental status and respiratory status have improved. Her code status has been reversed to full code, and she is being treated with metoprolol for rate control. The patient also has hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, and a Clostridium difficile infection. She is receiving nutritional support through a regular oral diet and has a PICC line in place. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's current condition is stable on nasal cannula oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can cause hemodynamic instability and increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
3. Lung Cancer: The patient's large cell lung cancer can progress and spread to other organs, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's high calcium levels can cause various symptoms such as confusion, kidney dysfunction, and cardiac arr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer, presenting with tachycardia. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), pneumonia, cancer, hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff). The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by a bulky pulmonary tumor burden, but has now been extubated and is stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula without respiratory distress. She completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia last day [2-25], and ceftriaxone and restart antibiotics were started today. The patient's chest X-ray shows improved left lung air field. She has been restarted on radiation therapy after it was stopped due to worsening mental status, which has now resolved. The patient will receive 10 more radiation treatments, and further chemotherapy will be discussed with a fellow tomorrow. She has been diagnosed with C. diff and has been on a 14-day course of vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status initially required intubation due to a bulky pulmonary tumor burden causing left lung collapse. Although she has been extubated and is stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the tumor burden worsens or if she develops any new"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer, who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and worsening respiratory status requiring intubation. She was previously extubated and is now stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula without respiratory distress. 

The patient has completed a course of vancomycin andzosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia last day [2-25]. CIS and restart antibiotics. Today's chest X-ray shows improved left lung air field. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was up to 180 yesterday. She is rate-controlled on oral diltiazem and PO metoprolol. The heart rate ranges from 100 to 130s. Dilt and metoprolol will be titrated for persistently elevated blood pressures above 140. The goal heart rate is 90-110. The CHADS score is 0, and she is on aspirin. Due to bleeding risk, further anticoagulation will be deferred at this time. 

The patient's cancer has been restarted today after being stopped in the setting of worsening mental status, which has now resolved. She will receive 9 more radiation treatments. It is likely that there will be no more chemotherapy, but a meeting will be held tomorrow with the medical oncologist to discuss further.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history. She has a sternal wound infection post ASD repair, a newly diagnosed large cell lung cancer causing post-obstructive pneumonia, recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, improving mental and respiratory status, and code status changed from comfort measures only to full code. The patient is currently undergoing palliative radiation therapy (XRT) for her cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) - The patient has a history of recurrent AF with RVR, which has improved with medication adjustments. However, the patient's tumor burden and prior ASD repair contribute to persistent AF. Anticoagulation therapy may be considered pending further evaluation.
2. Pneumonia - The patient has completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia, and her chest x-ray shows improving aeration in the left upper lobe. Ongoing monitoring is required to ensure resolution of the infection.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm) - The patient is continuing with palliative XRT for her cancer. Additional palliative chemotherapy options are being discussed with the oncology team.
4. Leukopenia - The patient's recent chemotherapy may have caused leukopenia. Daily monitoring of the differential and potential administration of G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) are planned.
5. Hypercalcemia (High Calcium) - The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history including a sternal wound infection post ASD repair, newly diagnosed large cell lung cancer causing post-obstructive pneumonia, recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, improving mental status and respiratory status, and reversal of code status from comfort measures only (CMO) to full code. 

The patient has been receiving palliative radiation therapy (XRT) and is scheduled to receive 11 more treatments. There is a discussion about potential palliative chemotherapy options with the oncology team tomorrow. The patient is also dealing with leukopenia, likely due to a post-chemotherapy response, and may start granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) pending oncology approval.

The patient has been treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn, and the chest X-ray shows improving aeration in the left upper lobe, suggesting a possible response to radiation therapy rather than chemotherapy. The patient is also experiencing hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, and Clostridium difficile infection, for which she is completing an additional two weeks of treatment.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin due to prolonged immobilization. The patient's diet consists of a regular oral diet, and she has a peripherally inserted central"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer. She was admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and worsening respiratory status, requiring intubation. The patient has been extubated and is now stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula without respiratory distress. She completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia yesterday. Her chest X-ray shows improved left lung air field.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by a bulky pulmonary tumor burden encasing the left mainstem bronchus and resulting in left lobe collapse. The patient's respiratory status is now stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula without respiratory distress.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib with RVR. She was up to 180 beats per minute yesterday but is currently rate-controlled on maximum doses of diltiazem and metoprolol. The goal heart rate is between 90-110 beats per minute. The patient's CHADS score is 0, and she is on aspirin. Due to bleeding risk, further anticoagulation is deferred at this time.

3. Cancer: The patient's cancer treatment involves radiation therapy (XRT), which was temporarily stopped due to worsening mental status but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer, who was admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and worsening respiratory status requiring intubation. She was extubated and is currently stable on supplemental oxygen. The patient completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia, and recent chest X-ray showed improved aeration of the right lung. She has been started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the bulky tumor burden encasing the left mainstem bronchus and left lobe collapse.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may progress and become difficult to control, leading to potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Neutropenia: The patient has developed neutropenia, which increases the risk of infection. She will require daily Neupogen injections to increase her absolute neutrophil count.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection while on vancomycin and zosyn. She will need to continue with oral vancomycin and be monitored for any signs of recurrence.
5. Cancer Progression: The patient's large cell lung cancer may progress despite chemotherapy and radiation therapy, potentially leading to further complications and deterioration of her overall health status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history. She has undergone ASD repair and has been diagnosed with large cell lung cancer causing post-obstructive pneumonia. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, improving mental status, and respiratory status. Her code status was recently changed from comfort measures only (CMO) to full code, and she is now on palliative chemotherapy. She is neutropenic due to recent chemotherapy treatment and has been started on G-CSF. She also has hypercalcemia, hypoxemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She remains stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and has completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has persistent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia secondary to lung cancer. This can progress and lead to severe respiratory distress or sepsis.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has high levels of calcium in her blood, which can cause kidney stones, bone pain, confusion, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient is currently stable on nasal cannula oxygen but may require more advanced respiratory support if her oxygenation levels deteriorate.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including a sternal wound infection post ASD repair, newly diagnosed large cell lung cancer, recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and undergoing palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient is currently in the ICU, stable from an ICU standpoint, and awaiting transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Rate control measures, such as metoprolol and PO diltiazem, are being used to manage this condition. However, the patient's multiple reasons for persistent atrial fibrillation, including tumor burden in the lung and prior ASD repair, need to be addressed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has completed the course of antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia and remains stable on 4 L NC, with improved aeration on the most recent chest X-ray. However, there is a risk of ongoing infection or new infections due to the patient's compromised immune system and extensive lung involvement from malignancy.

3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient is continuing palliative radiation therapy for her large cell lung cancer. Goals of care have been readdressed with the oncology team, and the plan is to continue palliative chemotherapy. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient has developed eosinophilia, which is likely paraneoplastic and should be followed with a differential. This condition requires further investigation and management.

5. Neutropenia: The patient is expected to have a nadir post recent chemotherapy, and G-CSF has been restarted to stimulate the production of neutrophils. The patient is on neutropenic precautions and is at high risk for mucositis, so neutropenic oral care has been initiated.

6. Hypoxemia: The patient has extensive lung involvement from malignancy, and currently stable on NC O2. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and providing adequate oxygen supplementation is essential to maintain proper oxygenation.

7. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is completing an additional two weeks of treatment for Clostridium difficile infection since completing antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia. Repeat cultures are pending.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications that require careful monitoring and management. Close collaboration between the ICU team, oncology team, and other specialists is crucial to optimize the patient's care and address potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer, presenting with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR). She was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and required intubation. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia and has shown improved aeration of the right lung on recent chest X-ray. She has also undergone one cycle of chemotherapy and two sessions of radiation therapy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a bulky tumor burden encasing the left mainstem bronchus and left lobe collapse. However, her respiratory status is now stable on 4L nasal cannula without respiratory distress.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation with a high risk of bleeding. She has achieved better rate control with rates between 90-130s on oral diltiazem and metoprolol. Systemic anticoagulation is being held due to the tumor burden and high risk of bleeding. Digoxin may be considered for rate control.
3. Neutropenia: The patient is neutropenic and was started on Neupogen. Empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime is being initiated. Daily monitoring of counts is planned, and transfusion for a hematocrit (Hct) less than 21 is anticipated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of large cell lung cancer and left lung collapse. She was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and worsening respiratory status requiring intubation. The patient's vital signs are stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. She has completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia and received one cycle of chemotherapy and two treatments of external beam radiation therapy. 

The patient has newly diagnosed large cell lung cancer with significant tumor burden and has been neutropenic since [**3-1**]. She has a central line infection and was started on empiric vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's recent lab results show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, but her platelet count has improved. Her creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are elevated. She also has an elevated lactate level and low albumin level. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation has been better controlled with rates between 90-130s on oral diltiazem and metoprolol. Systemic anticoagulation will be held due to high risk of bleeding. 

The patient has a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile and is being treated with oral vancomycin. She is currently not experiencing any acute distress and is alert and oriented. 

Plan:
1. Continue supplemental oxygen as needed.
2. Start CIS"
