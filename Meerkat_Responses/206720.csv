   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today, 100
   TID [**11-30**] with dilantin level in [**11-30**] am.
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, add back low dose
   propofol if necessary.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, UA and urine cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   extubation tomorrow AM after studies & seizures under control.
   - titrate vent by ABGs
   - wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if possible
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Trend in AM.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs in the
   AM (2 sets 12 hours apart).
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. (diet at facility no potatoes, tomatoes, oranges,
   or bananas due to renal disease). replete lytes prn.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of hyperperfusion syndrome, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), recent carotid endarterectomy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with seizures three times earlier today. The patient has a history of right focal motor seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on dilantin for a period of time. He was intubated for airway protection in the emergency department (ED) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and had three episodes earlier today. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these seizures, and appropriate treatment will be required to prevent further seizure activity.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection in the ED and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Weaning off sedation and extubation may be considered once his respiratory status improves and seizure activity is under control.
3. Lactic acidosis: The patient had an elevated lactate level on admission, which has since resolved. Monitoring and management of lactate levels will continue to ensure normal metabolic function.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), indicating possible liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of right focal seizures, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent carotid endarterectomy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with three episodes of seizures earlier today. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is sedated with propofol. He is responding to voice and moving all four extremities.

The patient's medical history is significant for hyperperfusion syndrome following his first carotid endarterectomy. He was on dilantin for a period of time but never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The differential diagnosis for the current seizure episodes includes infectious, stroke, toxic/metabolic, and primary seizure disorder. A CT scan of the head showed no acute hemorrhage but revealed multiple hypodensities that appear chronic. The CSF analysis showed mild elevation of protein but was otherwise normal. Lactate levels were elevated on admission but have since returned to normal.

The patient is being covered with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir pending HSV PCR results. An EEG is being monitored overnight. Dilantin levels are being monitored, and the dosage is being adjusted accordingly. Seizure precautions are in place, and the patient is on a low dose of propofol as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi lumen start. The patient has undergone a lumbar puncture, urine culture, and received various medications including propofol, heparin sodium, and dilantin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's ABG results show respiratory alkalosis, improving with decreased VT and FiO2. The patient is responding to voice early in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation is important.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Close monitoring of renal function through laboratory tests and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte balance is necessary.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient has experienced seizure activity, and antiepileptic drugs like lorazepam and dilantin have been administered. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity and ensuring proper seizure management is crucial.
4. Infection: The patient's urine culture has been obtained, indicating a concern for infection. Regular assessment"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today, 100
   TID [**11-30**] with dilantin level in [**11-30**] am.
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, add back low dose
   propofol if necessary.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, UA and urine cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   extubation tomorrow AM after studies & seizures under control.
   - titrate vent by ABGs
   - wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if possible
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Trend in AM.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs in the
   AM (2 sets 12 hours apart).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of right focal seizures, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent carotid endarterectomy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with three episodes of seizures earlier today. Differential diagnoses for the seizures include infectious, stroke, toxic/metabolic, and primary seizure disorder. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels and several abnormalities in kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of focal motor seizures, and the recent episodes of seizures need to be managed effectively to prevent further seizures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection in the emergency department and may require continued mechanical ventilation until his respiratory function improves.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had an elevated lactate level on admission, which resolved on repeat ABG. Monitoring for any signs of recurrence is important.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate an underlying liver condition or drug-induced liver injury. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD): The patient has chronic kidney disease requiring regular hemodialysis. Close monitoring of renal function and adherence to the HD schedule are crucial.
6. Type 2 DM: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with recent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) who presented with seizures and respiratory failure. He has a history of focal motor seizures after a previous CEA. The patient is alert, but critically ill. He is on mechanical ventilation and sedated. Notably, he has a history of allergies to lorazepam, hallucinations, and antibiotic use.

24-hour events include multi lumen start, lumbar puncture, and urine culture. The patient has been receiving various medications such as propofol, heparin sodium, dilantin, chlorhex, acyclovir, sertraline, lipitor, calcitriol, and prevacid.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizure with status epilepticus: No evidence of further seizure activity. Unclear etiology. No evidence of new CNS vascular event, although an MRI will be done to confirm. Lumbar puncture not consistent with CNS infection, will stop antibiotics and await HSV PCR before stopping acyclovir.
2. Respiratory failure/airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): Will attempt to extubate once MRI is completed.
3. Renal failure, end stage (end stage renal disease, ESRD): Hemodialysis today.
4. Hypertension: Meds held while sedated and relatively [Name (NI)].

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to prolonged hospitalization, use of invasive lines, and immunosuppression.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest and immobility can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Renal failure: The patient already has end-stage renal disease, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
6. Seizure recurrence: Although no further seizure activity is currently observed, there is a risk of recurrent seizures due to the patient's history and underlying condition.
7. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the inability to protect the airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and subsequent status epilepticus. The patient has a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and seizure disorder. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/60 mmHg to 190/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is extubated successfully and not on any respiratory support.

The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone) for suspected sepsis but was discontinued due to an elevated creatinine level. Dilantin was started for seizure prophylaxis, and heparin sodium was initiated for DVT prophylaxis.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of hallucinations. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

Lab results show elevated levels of potassium, creatinine, and glucose. White blood cell count is within normal range. The patient's platelet count is stable. Other lab values, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include hypertension, seizure with status epilepticus, and risk for airway compromise due to inability to protect the airway. The patient also has end"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today,
   Dilatin level 7.8 this am given additional 300mg x1, to get 100 TID
   [**11-30**]. Dilatin level and free dilatin ([**1-29**] renal failure) to be
   collected 1 hr after 300mg dose this am
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, wean  low dose propofol
   as tolerated.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, and urine cultures
   - Vascular suggest transcranial Doppler to r/o reperfusion syndrome
   non-emergently after MR, EEG. Talk to rads have no equipment to do
   test. Need to contact neuro to see if they do test.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   today  after MR studies & seizures under control.
   -          wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if
   possible
   -          called by rads, ET tube against R tracheal wall, balloon
   hyperinflated, respiratory to adjust
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Stable this AM. Continue to trend
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   -          continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   -          clarify with neuron rads if contrast needed cause may need
   hd tomorrow if getting contrast.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs with
   flat CK, stable trop (2 sets 12 hours apart).

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of right focal seizures, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent carotid endarterectomy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with three episodes of seizures earlier today. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and likely will be extubated today after MR studies and seizure control. He is on multiple medications including dilantin, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is responsive with strong bilateral hand grip on command. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for cool feet with plus pulses bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine and lactate levels, but other values are within normal limits. Assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of seizure activity, weaning of sedation, MRI/MRA brain and neck evaluation for cerebrovascular accident (CVA), continuation of antiepileptic medication, and further evaluation of potential causes of seizures. The patient also has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, lactic acidosis, transaminitis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), type 2 DM, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypertension. The patient's family has been informed and consented to full code status."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old man with a medical history of right focal seizures with hyperperfusion syndrome, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent carotid endarterectomy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with seizures three times earlier today. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Seizures: The patient has a history of right focal motor seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy. Neurology suspects this may be consistent with a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and reperfusion syndrome, as well as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on imaging. Other etiologies including toxic-metabolic, hypoglycemic have been ruled out. A final MRI read and neurology recommendations are pending.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he was successfully extubated yesterday.

3. Transaminitis: The cause of transaminitis is unknown. It is resolving, and the patient should continue to be monitored.

4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD): The patient's plan includes HD today, continuing nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo.

5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient's HbA1c levels indicate poor glycemic control. Further evaluation and management are needed.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is near recent baseline. It should continue to be monitored.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is near baseline. It should continue to be monitored.

8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has improved. His home regimen will be restarted today, including enalapril, and his current medication will be monitored. If stable, diovan may be added.

9. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient should continue with aspirin (ASA) and statin therapy. Coronary angiography (CE) was negative.

10. Fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition: The patient requires repletion of electrolytes as needed and is allowed to advance his diet as tolerated.

11. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent future episodes.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, he may still require monitoring and support.
3. Transaminitis: The cause of transaminitis should be identified and treated to prevent further liver damage.
4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient requires ongoing management of ESRD, including regular hemodialysis sessions and medication adjustments.
5. Type 2 DM: Poor glycemic control increases the risk of complications such as infections and cardiovascular events. Further evaluation and management are needed.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Monitoring and management of these conditions are necessary to prevent complications associated with low blood cell counts.
7. Hypertension: Blood pressure control is essential to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage.
8. CAD: Ongoing management of CAD is necessary to prevent further cardiac events.
9. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: Close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte levels are crucial to prevent complications such as dehydration or electrolyte disturbances.
10. Infections: Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent infections such as DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

It is important to note that the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications."

He has a history of hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 141/55 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 550 mL, RR set at 10 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 14 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination reveals blind right eye, normocephalic head, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, and no muscle wasting or ability to stand. Neurological examination shows attentive and oriented to person, purposeful movement, and normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine level of 6.7 mg/dL, low hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose level of 244 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.
