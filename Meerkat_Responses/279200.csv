","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented after being found down with hyperglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and an acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: The patient has hyperglycemia, and there is a possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to the presence of anion gap, lactic acidosis, and renal failure. It is important to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin to maintain blood sugar within a normal range.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating muscle breakdown, likely due to the fall/found down incident. This condition can lead to kidney damage and other complications. Fluid resuscitation and monitoring of kidney function are crucial.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has signs of ARF, which may be secondary to rhabdomyolysis, severe volume depletion, and other factors. Repletion of volume deficit and close monitoring of renal function are essential.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be caused by subdural hematoma, electrolyte and metabolic"

1. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: The patient has hyperglycemia with an elevated blood glucose level of 363 mg/dL. It is uncertain whether this is due to Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HONK) or Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis but also has lactic acidosis and acute renal failure. No ketones were detected in the initial urine analysis, so further evaluation is needed.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is significantly elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 1757**], indicating muscle breakdown. This is likely a result of the patient's fall and being found down. The patient is currently receiving fluid boluses with 1/2NS plus 1.5 amp bicarb gtt to promote urine output and prevent kidney damage.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has evidence of acute renal failure with elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. This is likely related to severe volume depletion, rhabdomyolysis, and possibly the use of certain medications.

   80M with history of DM on insulin, presenting after found down with
   hyperglycemia, rhabdo, ARF, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia/diabetes.  Does not have ketones, making this
   hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome.  Glucoses normalized with the
   insulin drip and we are now attempting to transition back to SQ
   insulin.  Unclear what the precipitating event for his hyperglycemia
   was, or whether the HONK is causing his altered mental status.
   - Check labs Q8hrs today to follow in the setting of massive
   electrolyte shifts.  Now replete for K<3.5 only because of renal
   failure.
   - Received total of 30 units of Lantus this morning, which we will
   supplement with a sliding scale.
   - Follow finger sticks Q2hrs but avoid stacking insulin doses.
   - Hold oral antidiabetic meds for now.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis.  Highest CK to date is [**Numeric Identifier **], which is almost
   definitely due to the patient being found down for an unclear amount of
   time.  His venous pH was reassuring (slightly alkalotic as desired).
   We will begin today be being aggressive with our rehydration at 500ccs
   an hour, monitoring closely for signs of hypoxia, which would suggest
   pulmonary congestion.
   - hold home statin.
   - continue to keep patient slightly alkalotic with 1/2NS plus 1.5 amp
   bicarb gtt at 500cc/hour.
   - Goal UOP 300cc/hr.
   .
   # ARF.  Almost definitely due to rhabdomyolysis and dehydration as
   above, which should improve with aggressive rehydration.  Given his
   severe diabetes, he may have a chronic component as well.
   - Replete volume deficit; goal UOP as above.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Likely multifactorial with subdural,
   electrolyte and metabolic disturbances.  We do not know his baseline.
   We should monitor for stabilization of his subdural (largely chronic)
   and try to find a contact for him who can tell us his baseline mental
   status.
   - repeat head CT this morning
   - correct lytes as above.
   - f/u TSH, B12, folate, RPR, tox screens.
   - repeat UA and sediment.
   - social work consult to identify social contacts.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Anion gap 20 on admission, improved to
   15 this morning.  Likely primarily due to acute renal failure.
   - Repeat urinalysis.
   - Management of renal failure as above.
   .
   # Subdural hematoma.  Acute on chronic, though acute component small.
   Unclear if was result of fall, cause of fall, or unrelated.
   Neurosurgery consulted.
   - Next head CT 24 hours after first.
   - Hold ASA.

   # Hyponatremia.  Normalizes to 143 when corrected for glucose.  At risk
   for hyperglycemia when glucose corrects given overall volume depletion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented after being found down with hyperglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and an acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: The patient has hyperglycemia but does not have ketones, indicating hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome (HONK). The glucose levels have normalized with the insulin drip, and there is an attempt to transition back to subcutaneous insulin. It is unclear what triggered the hyperglycemia or if HONK is causing the altered mental status.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has high levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating rhabdomyolysis, likely due to being found down for an unknown duration. Aggressive hydration is being administered to prevent further kidney damage.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has ARF, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis and dehydration. Aggressive rehydration is being initiated to improve renal function.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including subdural hematoma, electrolyte, and metabolic disturbances. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man who was found down and diagnosed with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK), rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. He is currently on an insulin drip and has become euglycemic. The patient's renal function is improving, but he experiences intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). There are no known drug allergies, and he is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for an elevated heart rate ranging from 110-134 beats per minute. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,098 mL and output of 1,130 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a SpO2 of 99%. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, with clear breath sounds and warm skin. Neurological assessment shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Lab results show elevated levels of glucose (363 mg/dL), creatinine (4.8), blood urea nitrogen (148 K/uL), potassium (4.8 mEq/L), and lactate (2.9 mmol/L). Other labs indicate elevated white blood cell count (19.6 K/uL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a chief complaint of acute renal failure (ARF). He was found down and diagnosed with hypoglycemic on ketosis (HONK), rhabdomyolysis, and ARF. The patient has been on an insulin drip, became euglycemic, and was placed on long-acting insulin. He experienced mild hypoglycemia but received D5. His renal function is improving, and he is now producing more urine. The patient also had an episode of intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but responded well to medication. The patient's allergies, medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions. Vital signs are within normal ranges, with a heart rate of 110 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 149/69 mmHg to 165/120 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with total intake of 4,098 mL and output of 3,593 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and nasal cannula oxygen with an ABG pending. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, warm skin, attentive neurologic status, and normal extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit,"

   We will begin today be being aggressive with our rehydration at 500ccs
   an hour, monitoring closely for signs of hypoxia, which would suggest
   pulmonary congestion.
   - hold home statin.
   - continue to keep patient slightly alkalotic with 1/2NS plus 1.5 amp
   bicarb gtt at 500cc/hour.
   - Goal UOP 300cc/hr.
   .
   # ARF.  Almost definitely due to rhabdomyolysis and dehydration as
   above, which should improve with aggressive rehydration.  Given his
   severe diabetes, he may have a chronic component as well.
   - Replete volume deficit; goal UOP as above.
   - Renal following.

   # Altered mental status.  Likely multifactorial with subdural,
   electrolyte and metabolic disturbances.  We do not know his baseline.
   We should monitor for stabilization of his subdural (largely chronic)
   and try to find a contact for him who can tell us his baseline mental
   status.
   - repeat head CT this morning
   - correct lytes as above.
   - f/u TSH, B12, folate, RPR, tox screens.
   - repeat UA and sediment.
   - social work consult to identify social contacts.

   15 this morning.  Likely primarily due to acute renal failure.
   - Repeat urinalysis.
   - Management of renal failure as above.

   Unclear if was result of fall, cause of fall, or unrelated.
   Neurosurgery consulted.
   - Next head CT 24 hours after first.
   - Hold ASA.

   # Possible C-spine trauma: there are OSH CT c-spine images that were
   seen here, but there is not a documented read.  We will follow-up with
   neurosurg that these images are normal, and then clear the patient
   clinically.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient has intermittent SVT, seems less likely sinus
   rhythm as he changes abruptly between rhythms.  First appeared to be
   linked to agitation, but not necessarily concordant.  Could be afib,
   though the rhythm appears regular on strips.
   - repeat ECG.
   - start lopressor 2.5mg Q6hrs and titrate up if tolerated.  Convert to
   POs once patient able.
   .
   # Abnormal LFTs.  Likely representative of muscle breakdown.
   - f/u final abdominal ultrasound read.

   # Elevated troponin.  In setting of renal failure and rhabdo, both
   which may be contributing. ECG without concerning findings at OSH and
   here.
   - Continue to trend.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus on insulin, presenting with hyperglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), and acute on chronic subdural hematoma. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: The patient has hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome (HONK) due to uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin therapy is being administered, but the underlying cause of his hyperglycemia needs to be determined.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels suggest rhabdomyolysis, likely caused by prolonged immobilization. Aggressive hydration is being given to prevent kidney damage.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF, which may be secondary to rhabdomyolysis and dehydration. Renal function should improve with aggressive rehydration.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including subdural hematoma, electrolyte and metabolic disturbances. Stabilization of the subdural hematoma and correction of electrolytes are ongoing.

5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis, which has partially improved. Management of renal failure is ongoing.

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 TRAUMA, S/P
   80M with history of DM on insulin, presenting after found down with
   hyperglycemia, rhabdo, ARF, and acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia/diabetes.  Does not have ketones, making this
   hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome.  Glucoses normalized with the
   insulin drip and we are now attempting to transition back to SQ
   insulin.  Unclear what the precipitating event for his hyperglycemia
   was, or whether the HONK is causing his altered mental status.
   - Check labs Q8hrs today to follow in the setting of massive
   electrolyte shifts.  Now replete for K<3.5 only because of renal
   failure.
   - Received total of 30 units of Lantus this morning, which we will
   supplement with a sliding scale.
   - Follow finger sticks Q2hrs but avoid stacking insulin doses.
   - Hold oral antidiabetic meds for now.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis.  Highest CK to date is [**Numeric Identifier **], which is almost
   definitely due to the patient being found down for an unclear amount of
   time.  His venous pH was reassuring (slightly alkalotic as desired).
   We will begin today be being aggressive with our rehydration at 500ccs
   an hour, monitoring closely for signs of hypoxia, which would suggest
   pulmonary congestion.
   - Check one set of pm lytes
   - Check PM CK
   - hold home statin.
   - continue to keep patient slightly alkalotic with 1/2NS plus 1.5 amp
   bicarb gtt at 400cc/hour.
   - Goal UOP >150 cc/hour
   .
   # ARF.  Almost definitely due to rhabdomyolysis and dehydration as
   above, which should improve with aggressive rehydration.  Given his
   severe diabetes, he may have a chronic component as well. Improving.
   - Replete volume deficit; goal UOP as above.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Likely multifactorial with subdural,
   electrolyte and metabolic disturbances.  We do not know his baseline.
   We should monitor for stabilization of his subdural (largely chronic)
   and try to find a contact for him who can tell us his baseline mental
   status. Improving.
   - correct lytes as above.
   - f/u TSH, B12, folate, RPR, toxicology screens.
   - repeat UA and sediment.
   - social work consult to identify social contacts and get a sense for
   patient
s baseline mental status.
   - speech & swallow consult today
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Anion gap 20 on admission, improved to
   15 this morning.  Likely primarily due to acute renal failure.
   - Repeat urinalysis.
   - Management of renal failure as above.
   .
   # Subdural hematoma.  Acute on chronic, though acute component small.
   Unclear if was result of fall, cause of fall, or unrelated.
   Neurosurgery consulted.
   - Next head CT 24 hours after first.
   - Hold ASA.
   .
   # Hct and platelet decrease
 appears dilutional.
   - Check 3PM CBC
   .
   # Possible C-spine trauma: there are OSH CT cervical spine images that
   were seen here, but there is not a documented read.  We will follow-up
   with neurosurgery that these images are normal, and then plan to clear
   the patient clinically.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient has intermittent SVT, seems less likely sinus
   rhythm as he changes abruptly between rhythms.  First appeared to be
   linked to agitation, but not necessarily concordant.  Could be afib,
   though the rhythm appears regular on strips.
   - repeat ECG.
   - start Lopressor 2.5mg Q6hrs and titrate up if tolerated.  Convert to
   POs once patient able.
   .
   # Abnormal LFTs.  Likely representative of muscle breakdown.
   - f/u final abdominal ultrasound read.
   .
   # Elevated troponin.  In setting of renal failure and rhabdomyolysis,
   both which may be contributing. ECG without concerning findings at OSH
   and here.
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated lipase.  Abdominal ultrasound prelim unremarkable, and
   patient has no abdominal pain on exam.  Not clinically important at
   this time.
   # BPH. Alpha blockers can affect mental status and patient has foley in
   place.  Will hold home alpha blocker for now.
   .
   FEN: IVFs as above, replete electrolytes; had difficulty taking with
   ice chips this morning, so place speech & swallow consult today
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   Access: Peripherals
   Code:  Presumed full
   Communication: Patient, no known contacts -> social work consult, f/u.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with hyperglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and acute subdural hematoma.
- Hyperglycemia has been managed with insulin, and electrolyte imbalances have been addressed.
- Rhabdomyolysis is being treated with aggressive hydration.
- Acute renal failure is expected to improve with continued hydration.
- Altered mental status is likely due to multiple factors including subdural hematoma, electrolyte and metabolic disturbances, and possibly the hyperglycemic episode.
- Anion gap metabolic acidosis is present and is being managed along with renal failure.
- Neurosurgery consultation has been obtained for the subdural hematoma.
- Possible C-spine trauma needs further evaluation.
- Tachycardia is present and may require further investigation and treatment.
- Abnormal liver function tests are likely related to muscle breakdown.
- Elevated troponin levels may be due to renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
- Elevated lipase levels are not clinically significant at this time.
- BPH is being managed by holding alpha-blocker medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's initial presentation included hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome (HONK)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man who was found down and admitted with hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and acute renal failure. He has shown improvement since admission. The patient has no known drug allergies and has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis and metoprolol.

24-hour events include changes in medical and family history, review of systems, and flowsheet data. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate between 65-113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/54-170/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a thin-appearing patient with a right eye hematoma, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological assessment shows the patient to be attentive, oriented to times three, and able to follow simple commands.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 148 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 4.8 and 3.6 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T levels, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 363 mg/dL, and abnormalities in liver function tests.

Assessment and plan include cardiac dysrhythmia, rhabdomyolysis, high risk for fall, impaired health maintenance, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), altered mental status, and trauma. The patient's altered mental status is improving but it is unclear if he will be able to take care of himself at home. Aggressive intravenous fluids will continue for rhabdomyolysis, and the patient's acute renal failure is improving with good urine output. Diabetes management should focus on better blood sugar control. Lopressor will be used for ectopic atrial tachycardia, and a social services evaluation is needed. The patient will be transferred to the floor."
