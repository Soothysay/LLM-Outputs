   87 y/o woman with hypertension, prior TIA admitted with right hand
   numbness, resolved, in setting of acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage.
   #. Subdural hemorrhage: Small area of acute hemorrhage in
   chronic-appearing subdural per imaging. No residual deficits per exam
   on arrival to MICU.
   - Holding all anticoagulation
   - INR goal 1 (1.4 per neuron), check q4h.  On 5^th unit FFP.  Post
   transfusion coags.
   -rec
d  vitamin K 10 mg PO X 1
   - Q2h neuro checks
   - Recheck HCT later today
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery and Neurology input
   - Neurosurg would like pt medically cleared prior to going to OR.  Will
   consult cards to help clear pt given that she will equivocally rule in
   with elev troponins
   - dilantin load tonight (1000 mg) then 100 mg TID per NSG recs.  Side
   effect of dilantin is hypotension which may explain her relative
   hypotension
   - [**Name (NI) **] elevated
   - repeat head CT this am
   - SSI for euglycemia
   # Chest pain: Patient did have one episode of chest pain in the ED,
   though now is pain-free. EKG does have symmetric T wave inversions,
   though difficult to assess given lack of baseline EKG and fact that
   prior EKG was paced. T wave inversions could reflect intracranial
   pathology though certainly ischemia should be ruled out.
   - CEs x 3.  Troponins elevated at 0.09
   - serial EKGs
   - ECHO in the AM to assess wall motion- [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 3798**] RN report- elevated
   PA pressures.  Need to f/up final read.
   - No anticoagulation
   - No BB currently due to relative hypotension
   - Consult cards for medical clearance in light of elev troponins and
   what will most likely be echo abnormalities
   # ? TIA: Neurology consultant believes symptoms compatible with lacunar
   infarct, will be difficult to see on CT. Cannot get MRI due to
   pacemaker. UA negative for infection though certainly infection could
   cause re-presentation of neuro deficits.
   - risk stratification with A1c, lipids in AM.  Labs pending
   - hold any anticoagulation as per above
   - consider CTA after acute bleed addressed (per Neurology)
   - no sign of infection but will sent blood cx with this morning
s labs
   #. Hypertension: Hypertensive on arrival, now with BPs 120s while
   resting comfortably.
   - Hold all antihypertensives
   - consider BB (due to ? ischemia) if SBP > 185
   #. Anemia: Baseline Hct unknown. Add on iron studies.  Will guiac next
   stool.
   # GERD: Continue ppi.
   # Osteoporosis: Hold fosamax for now, will resume when clinically
   stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and prior transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was admitted with right hand numbness, which has since resolved.
- She has an acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU).
- The patient's INR is elevated at 1.5 due to anticoagulation therapy, and she received four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.
- She is being held on anticoagulation, and her INR goal is 1.4 as per neurosurgery recommendation.
- Neurological checks are being done every two hours, and her head CT is scheduled for this morning.
- The patient has elevated troponins, and there is a concern for possible myocardial infarction (MI). However, given her head bleed, she cannot tolerate heparin.
- An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed symmetric T-wave inversions, which could indicate intracranial pathology or ischemia.
- The patient's chest pain has resolved, but serial EKGs are planned to assess for any changes.
- An echocardiogram (ECHO) is scheduled in the morning to evaluate for wall motion abnormalities.
- The patient has hypertension, which is currently being managed with medication hold.
- She also has anemia with a baseline Hct unknown, and iron studies are being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and previous episodes of hand numbness and expressive aphasia. She was admitted with subdural hemorrhage and currently has small areas of acute hemorrhage in chronic-appearing subdural space. There are no residual deficits. The patient's INR is elevated, and she is on blood thinners, which need to be reversed due to the presence of bleeding. Her chest pain and T-wave inversions on EKG are concerning for possible cardiac ischemia, but further evaluation is needed. The patient also has anemia, hypertension, and GERD. She has a pneumoboots and PPI regimen for home use. The patient is currently in the MICU and has code status set to full code. She is NPO and has been repleting electrolytes as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased risk of bleeding due to elevated INR and ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
2. Possible cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction indicated by chest pain and T-wave inversions on EKG.
3. Potential infection or re-presentation of neuro deficits, as mentioned in the neurology consultation.
4. Uncontrolled hypertension despite current treatment.
5. Anemia that requires further evaluation and management.
6. GERD, which may require ongoing management with PPI therapy.
7. Osteoporosis treatment should be resumed when clinically stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA.  TIA symptoms
   have resolved but SDH persists.  She also has substantial hypoxemia in
   the setting of multiple units of FFP.  Current problems include:
          Subdural hematoma
          Abnormal EKG and slightly positive troponin (neurogenic vs.
   cardiac)
          Normotense in the setting of history of hypertension
          Anemia
          Hypoxemia
   We will continue seizure prophylaxis.  She will likely need SDH
   drainage per neurosurgery.  We will follow up the echocardiogram report
   and ask cardiology to comment on risk-reducing maneuvers.
   Her hypoxemia is also concerning.  Most likely related to FFP: we will
   check a CXR to start the evaluation.
   For her anemia, we will guaiac stool and follow serial Hcts.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma and possible transient ischemic attack (TIA). The TIA symptoms have resolved, but the subdural hematoma persists. She also has substantial hypoxemia in the setting of multiple units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her current problems include subdural hematoma, abnormal EKG with slightly positive troponin (neurogenic vs. cardiac), normotensive in the setting of a history of hypertension, anemia, and hypoxemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural hematoma: If not managed appropriately, the subdural hematoma may worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
2. Abnormal EKG and positive troponin: These findings could indicate an underlying cardiac issue such as a myocardial infarction. If left untreated, it may lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels could be related to FFP transfusion. If not addressed, it may result in tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia. If not managed appropriately, it may lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Normotensive in the setting of history of hypertension: The patient's current normotensive state, despite a history of hypertension, requires further investigation and management to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA vs partial
   seizures as well as what appears to be an acute MI with substantial
   heart failure.  TIA symptoms have resolved but SDH persists.  She also
   has substantial hypoxemia in the setting of multiple units of FFP and
   newly diagnosed systolic CHF.  Current problems include:
   # SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 Stable. INR goal 1. Currently 1.4.  Very
   high risk surgical candidate per cards
 prefer medical management.
   -          Vitamin K 10mg PO today
   -          avoid warfarin until cleared by neurosurg
   -          follow INR.  At this point (given pulmonary edema), risks of
   FFP outweigh benefits barring further changes in SDH or increases in
   INR
   -          surgical management per neurosurgery
   -          change neuro checks to q4hours
   -          convert dilantin to PO for sz ppx/control
   -          f/u neurosurg, neurology recs
   # MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   -          management limited by SDH
   -          beta blockade.  Will tolerate SBPs down to 110 for now
   -          diurese gently today to try to decrease myocardial O2 demand
   and improve pulmonary edema (-500 goal)
   # TIA vs Seizure
 Aside from RUE weakness, sx largely resolved.
   -          f/u neurosurgery, neurology recs
   -          continue dilantin
   -          consider CTA as per neuro for further characterization of ?
   ischemia in setting of inability to do MR b/c pacer
   # HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE
   -          diuresis as above
   -          beta blockade given risk of VT in peri-infarct period
   -          hold on ACEI for now given that above takes priority and BP
   is limited
   -          f/u outpatient cardiology records (esp echo to determine if
   any acute ischemic changes manifesting as new pulmonary edema)
   # Anemia
   -          follow up iron studies
   # GERD
   -          PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma, possible transient ischemic attack (TIA) or partial seizures, acute myocardial infarction, anemia, and heart failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/80 mmHg to 98/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving various medications, including lasix, dilantin, and protonix. Her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, as well as abnormalities in kidney function. Imaging shows no significant change in the chronic left subdural hematoma, but reveals extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient's current problems include subdural hematoma, myocardial infarction, TIA/seizure, acute systolic heart failure, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Management plans include medical management of subdural hematoma, avoiding warfarin until cleared by neurosurgery, close monitoring of INR, and surgical management per neurosurgery. For the myocardial infarction, beta blockade and diuretic therapy are being initiated to decrease myocard"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including subdural hematoma, possible transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has ongoing issues with her cardiac, neurological, and respiratory functions. The main concerns include managing the subdural hematoma, treating the heart attack, addressing the acute systolic CHF, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or increased intracranial pressure due to the subdural hematoma.
2. Development of further neurological deficits or stroke due to compromised blood flow.
3. Cardiogenic shock or ventricular arrhythmias as a result of the heart attack.
4. Pulmonary edema or worsening respiratory distress due to the acute CHF.
5. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility.
7. Hypotension or arrhythmias from beta-blocker therapy.
8. Worsening anemia from chronic disease or blood loss.
9. Kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or medication effects.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including a subdural hematoma, possible transient ischemic attack (TIA) or partial seizures, and acute myocardial infarction with heart failure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a persistent subdural hematoma, which is a collection of blood between the covering of the brain and the surface of the brain. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack): The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, which is characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. If not managed effectively, this can lead to further damage to the heart muscle, heart failure, arrhythmias, and even death.

3. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is fluid accumulation in the lungs due to heart failure. This can compromise oxygenation and ventilation, leading to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

4. TIA vs Seizure: The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of a TIA or partial seizure. While the TIA symptoms have resolved, the underlying cause needs further investigation to prevent future episodes and to determine if any long-term"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma, possible transient ischemic attack (TIA) vs partial seizures, and an acute myocardial infarction (MI) with substantial heart failure. The patient's TIA symptoms have resolved, but the subdural hematoma persists. She also has hypoxemia and newly diagnosed systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current problems include subdural hematoma, acute MI, TIA vs seizure, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and osteoarthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a persistent subdural hematoma, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Acute Myocardial Infarction: The patient has experienced an acute MI, which increases the risk of further cardiac events such as ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even sudden cardiac death if not managed properly.

3. TIA vs Seizure: The patient may be at risk for recurrent TIAs or seizures if underlying causes are not addressed and appropriate preventive measures are not taken.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can further compromise oxygen delivery to tissues and may contribute to fatigue, weakness, or exacerbation of heart failure symptoms.

5. GERD: The patient has GERD"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA as well as what
   appears to be an acute MI with substantial heart failure.  TIA symptoms
   have resolved but SDH persists.  Her hypoxemia has improved but not
   resolved with diuresis. Current problems include:

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
          continue vitamin K
          avoid warfarin until cleared by neurosurg
          follow INR.  At this point (given pulmonary edema), risks of
   FFP outweigh benefits barring further changes in SDH or increases in
   INR
          surgical management per neurosurgery.  At present, the plan
   is to follow with intermittent CTs and neuro checks.  If her neurologic
   status declines she would need more urgent intervention.  However, the
   risks of surgical intervention are high in the peri-infarct period and
   we will defer as long as feasible.  Right now, I agree with
   neurosurgery and cardiology that the risks of surgical intervention
   outweigh benefits.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
          management limited by SDH
          Beta blockade.  Rhythm is not clear on telemetry right now
   (a-sensed v-paced vs. v-paced only).  Will check 12 lead and discuss
   with cardiology.
          Begin ACEI when beta blockade maximized or after a week
   (when VT risk is lower)
          Diurese gently today
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE
          diuresis as above
          beta blockade

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma, possible transient ischemic attack (TIA), and acute myocardial infarction (MI) presenting with substantial heart failure. Her TIA symptoms have resolved, but the subdural hematoma persists. The patient's hypoxemia has improved but not resolved with diuresis. The current problems include subdural hemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient's SDH persists, and there is a risk of further neurological decline if surgical management is not pursued. The risks of surgical intervention are high in the peri-infarct period, so intervention may be deferred as long as feasible.
2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The management of AMI is limited by the presence of SDH. The patient is on beta blockade and will be started on ACE inhibitors when beta blockade is maximized or after a week (when ventricular tachycardia risk is lower).
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient's heart failure is being managed with diuretics, beta blockade, and planned initiation of ACE inhibitors.
4. Anemia: Anemia is present, and further evaluation and management are required.
5. ICU Care: The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control"
