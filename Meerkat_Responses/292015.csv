   perirenal
   space compared to the most recent CT and consistent with hematoma.
   Possible
   subcapsular hematoma at the right inferior border of the liver.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension,
   impaired glucose intolerance POD 1 of right adrenalectomy for
   non-hormone secreting tumor admitted for anemia.
   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct < 28, receiving 3^rd unit this AM
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   .
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, and impaired glucose intolerance who underwent a right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor. She was admitted for anemia and experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels overnight. The patient received 2 units of blood, but the Hct levels continued to decrease. Further transfusion has been held off per surgery recommendations. The patient is experiencing nausea and dry heaves, and has been given Zofran IV. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient has been placed on NPO status, with plans for possible surgical intervention. Her Hct levels are being monitored every 4 hours. She is also being monitored for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treated with IV fluids as needed. Prophylactic IV PPI is being given, and a follow-up final read CT is planned. The patient will follow the recommendations from the primary general surgery team and monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency, although it is unlikely since no intervention was made to the left adrenal gland.

   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct, will space out checks if next hct stable
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   boluses PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   - Tylenol prn for fever/pain control
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.  Until then, can give IV synthroid.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   .
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension,
   impaired glucose intolerance POD 1 of right adrenalectomy for
   non-hormone secreting tumor admitted for anemia.
   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct, will space out checks if next hct stable
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   boluses PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   - Tylenol prn for fever/pain control
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.  Until then, can give IV synthroid.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   .
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, and impaired glucose intolerance.
- She underwent a right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor and was admitted for anemia.
- The patient experienced significant blood loss during surgery, leading to a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 30.1% to 21.1%. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and underwent further surgical intervention to address active bleeding.
- Postoperatively, the patient required reintubation due to tachypnea and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- Her temperature spiked to 101.3°F, and she has an upcoming blood and urine culture.
- The patient has low levels of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), which were replenished.
- Her white blood cell count (WBC) is increasing, and a differential count has been sent.
- The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, but she has impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and she is receiving appropriate medications for pain control, fever, and prophylaxis against stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient's surgical team is being consulted for further recommendations.
- The patient's disposition is currently"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, impaired glucose intolerance who underwent a right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor. She was admitted for anemia and re-exploration for post-operative bleeding. 

The patient's condition has been unstable since admission. She required IV levothyroxine due to hypothyroidism post-thyroidectomy. She also had a low Hct that necessitated a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells. The patient experienced active bleeding during surgery and required return to the operating room. 

She was reintubated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) due to tachypnea and agitation. Her endotracheal tube was placed too far, and it was withdrawn multiple times and placed 1 cm above the carina. The patient was extubated successfully without complications. 

The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and she has been febrile since midnight. Blood and urine cultures have been sent. 

Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation in PRVC/AC mode with a tidal volume of 440 mL, respiratory system resistance of 61, peak inspiratory pressure of 9 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient was extubated yesterday morning and is currently on bedrest, encouraged to perform incentive spirometry, and kept NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/77 mmHg to 154/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 3,397 mL, with an output of 2,845 mL. The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 190 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL, sodium level of 77 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.5 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 112 mg/dL. The patient's imaging, microbiology, and assessment/plans sections are pending or incomplete.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered if necessary.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,397"
