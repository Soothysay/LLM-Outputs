   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with history of CKD, Cirrhosis, BOOP and history of multiple
   drug overdoses with opiates presented to ER with lethargy.
   .
   # Lethargy - Most likely secondary to opiates given the history.  Ddx
   includes infectious (low grade fever in ED, LP negative) vs. other
   toxins like benzo (tox screen negative other than benzo) vs. metabolic
   (?uremia from renal failure, not very impressive) vs. Hypoglycemia (low
   BS now but on presentation it was 157).
   - CXR, UA negative for infection, LP negative. (received ceftriaxone in
   the ER).  Given history of cirrhosis may have ascities and thus would
   be improtant to rule out SBP.  Would check ultrasound for asicities.
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - hold sedating medications (neurontin, citalaprom)
   - Narcan 0.4mg X 1 overnight with minimal change but patient easily
   arousable at baseline.  Can d/c q2 hour neuro checks.
   - Will empirically give thimaine and folate for now eventhough daughter
   denies etoh [**Last Name (LF) 2697**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] ask pt in AM.
   - If no improvement in lethargy by AM would consider gettign RPR, TSH,
   B12 in AM and consider treatment with lactulose although Urea only
   30's.
   .
   #Overdose: Chronic issue for this substance abusing patient.
   - social work consult this AM.
   - Obtain OSH records
   - Discuss with family.
   .
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline(daughter stated she has some
   kidney failure).  Improved with IVF in ER.  Unclear baseline.  clearly
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - Urine Lytes equivocal with FeUrea of 35%
   - holding lasix, lisinpril for now.  Will need to get baseline labs
   from [**Hospital1 183**] in AM.
   .
   # Anemia - hct 29.6, unclear baseline, maybe from liver disease (MCV
   96) versus CKD
   - B12 and folate normal, Fe Sat 22%, Ferritin nml - Mixed picture with
   Anemia of chronic disease,
   - Continue PPI
   - Guaiac stools
   - Recheck AM labs as anticipate spurious value this AM.
   .
   #BOOP: Continue home prednisone dose, nebulizers PRN.
   - Follow oxygenation
   - Consider restarting lasix PRN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and multiple drug overdoses with opiates. The patient presented to the emergency room with lethargy and was found to have low blood sugar, which was initially thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia. However, further evaluation revealed negative results for infection, toxins other than benzodiazepines, metabolic causes, and hypoglycemia. The patient's lethargy is most likely attributed to the opiates given his history.

Plan:
- Narcan (naloxone) was administered overnight with minimal improvement, but the patient remains easily arousable.
- Thiamine and folate supplementation was given empirically.
- Further evaluation is planned in the morning, including a chest X-ray, urinalysis, and cultures.
- Social work consult and obtaining occupational safety and health records are also scheduled.
- The patient's family will be discussed with, and the patient's medical history from a previous hospital will be obtained.
- The patient's anemia and renal function will be further investigated, along with the cause of his acute renal failure.
- The patient's liver function tests will be reassessed, considering his history of cirrhosis.
- Chronic low back pain management will be postponed for now.
- Prednisone treatment for chronic lung disease/BOOP will be continued.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) until he is more arousable.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Potential Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which may increase the risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). An ultrasound to evaluate for ascites is planned, and cultures are pending.
2. Overdose: The patient has a history of substance abuse and multiple drug overdoses with opiates. Ongoing monitoring and social work consult are necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which could be due to liver disease or CKD. Further investigation is required to identify the underlying cause.
5. Diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels were initially low, but it is unclear if he has a history of diabetes. His insulin regimen will be reevaluated once more information is available.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient previously experienced elevated potassium levels, which may be related to renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
7. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests are currently unremarkable, but he has a history of cirrhosis. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and evaluation for complications such as ascites are important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old Spanish-speaking female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), depression, cirrhosis, and multiple previous admissions for opiate overdoses. She presents with lethargy, hypoglycemia, and a low-grade temperature. The patient responded to narcan, indicating possible opiate intoxication. She also has a history of chronic lung disease/BOOP and anemia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 141/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lethargy/Delirium: The patient's lethargy may be secondary to intoxication from street drugs, hypoglycemia, or an underlying infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a nongap metabolic acidosis, which could be related to intoxication, renal failure, or chronic kidney disease. Additional tests are required to assess the cause and severity of the acidosis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, but she has a history of CKD. Her recent improvement with intravenous fluids suggests possible prerenal azotemia. Further evaluation is necessary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), depression, cirrhosis, and previous admissions for drug overdoses. The patient presents with lethargy and drug intoxication symptoms. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/63 mmHg to 177/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, is well-nourished, and obese. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and no muscle wasting is observed. Neurological examination is unable to be assessed due to the patient's uncooperative nature.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, platelet count of 175 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 52 mg/dL. Other lab results including liver function tests, electrolytes, and imaging studies are provided but will not be discussed"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with history of CKD, Cirrhosis and history of multiple drug
   overdoses with opiates presented to ER with lethargy.
   .
   # Lethargy - Most likely secondary to opiates given the history and
   positive narcan test yesterday but is still extremely somnolent.  Ddx
   includes infectious (low grade fever in ED, LP negative) vs. other
   toxins like benzo (tox screen negative other than benzo) vs. metabolic
   (?uremia from renal failure, not very impressive) vs. Hypoglycemia (low
   BS now but on presentation it was 157).
   - At this time, would consider [**Doctor Last Name 2558**] scale and titrate as directed.
   Hold narcan unless non-responsive, or in resipratory distress.
   - CXR, UA negative for infection, LP negative. (received ceftriaxone in
   the ER).  Given history of cirrhosis may have ascities and thus would
   be improtant to rule out SBP.  Would check ultrasound for asicities.
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - hold sedating medications (neurontin, citalaprom)
   - Will empirically give thimaine and folate for now eventhough daughter
   denies etoh [**Last Name (LF) 2697**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] ask pt in AM.
   - If no improvement in lethargy by AM would consider gettign RPR, TSH,
   B12 in AM.
   .
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline(daughter stated she has some
   kidney failure).  Improved with IVF in ER.
   - Creatinine down to 0.8 this AM -> baseline.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - holding lasix, lisinpril for now.  Goal I/O net even and lasix prn.
   Would hold Lasix/ACE until stable x24 hours.
   - Continue maitnence fluids.  Need to be wary of volume overload.
   .
   # DM - hold glargine insulin for now and check fingersticks q2 given
   some low BS in the ER.
   - transition to q4H finger sticks
   - restart home insulin when taking PO's.
   .
   #Volume: H/o diastolic dysfunction and ARF leading to volume overload.
   - consider TTE for eval of cardiac function
   - Decreased fluids to 75cc/hr maintenence fluids while NPO.

","Summary of the progress note:

- The patient is a 58-year-old with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, and multiple drug overdoses with opiates.
- The patient presented to the emergency room with lethargy and was found to have a positive narcan test, indicating an opiate overdose.
- The patient's current condition includes lethargy, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, volume overload, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic low back pain, anemia, chronic lung disease/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), hyperkalemia, and fecal occult blood.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple drug overdoses and is currently on immunosuppressive medications such as prednisone for chronic lung disease/BOOP. This increases the risk of infection.

2. Liver failure: The patient has a diagnosis of NASH, which can lead to liver failure. Monitoring liver function tests and symptoms of liver dysfunction will be important.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of CKD and acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is necessary.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and experienced low blood sugar levels in the emergency room. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate insulin management is required.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with history of CKD, Cirrhosis and history of multiple drug
   overdoses with opiates presented to ER with lethargy.
   .
   # Lethargy - Most likely secondary to opiates given the history and
   positive narcan test yesterday but is still extremely somnolent.  Ddx
   includes infectious (low grade fever in ED, LP negative) vs. other
   toxins like benzo (tox screen negative other than benzo) vs. metabolic
   (?uremia from renal failure, not very impressive) vs. Hypoglycemia (low
   BS now but on presentation it was 157).
   - At this time, would continue [**Doctor Last Name 2558**] scale and titrate as directed.
   Hold narcan unless non-responsive, or in resipratory failure.
   - CXR, UA negative for infection, USD w/o ascites, LP negative.
   (received ceftriaxone in the ER).
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - hold sedating medications (neurontin, citalaprom)
   - Will empirically give thimaine and folate for now eventhough daughter
   denies etoh [**Last Name (LF) 2697**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] ask pt in AM.
   - If no improvement in lethargy by AM would consider gettign RPR, TSH,
   B12 in AM.
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Baseline 0.8
 improved with IVF
   - Creatinine down to 0.8 this AM -> baseline.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Restarting lasix today, holding ACE.  Restart ACE prn.
   .
   # DM - hold glargine insulin for now and check fingersticks q2 given
   some low BS in the ER.
   - transition to q4H finger sticks
   - restart home insulin when taking PO's.
   .
   #Hypertension: [**2-14**] to withdrawal but persistently hypertensive this AM
   and clearly not in withdrawal at this time.  Will start with lasix, and
   treat with opiates PRN for withdrawal.  Restart lisinopril PRN.
   .
   #Volume: H/o diastolic dysfunction and ARF leading to volume overload.
   - consider TTE for eval of cardiac function
   - Decreased fluids to 75cc/hr maintenence fluids while NPO.
   .
   # NASH - LFTs unremarkable but carries a diagnosis per history.
   - USD w/o e/o ascites, c/w NASH/fatty liver
   .
   # Chronic low back pain - would hold off on gabapentin and narcotics
   for now.
   - [**Doctor Last Name 2558**] scale
   .
   # Anemia - hct 29.6, unclear baseline, maybe from liver disease (MCV
   96) versus CKD
   - guaiac stools
   - B12 folate nml, Fe c/w ACD, stable from [**Hospital1 183**] records.
   .
   # Chronic lung disease/BOOP - would continue prednisone at 5mg
   - nebs prn -> improved this AM with nebulizer.  95-96% on RA
   currently.  Titrate O2 to sats = 90-95%.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia - resolved.
   # FEN - NPO for now until more arousable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, and multiple drug overdoses with opiates. The patient presented to the emergency room with lethargy and was found to have a positive narcan test, indicating exposure to opiates. The patient is still extremely somnolent and requires further evaluation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 164/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis and frequent admissions for volume overload and drug overdoses. It is mentioned that the patient is not receiving narcotics from primary care physicians or pain clinics, leading to the assumption that the patient may be obtaining narcotics from outside sources. The patient's social situation appears to be very difficult.

The patient has been started on the [**Initials (NamePattern4)**] scale and given 10 mg of methadone for narcotic withdrawal. An ultrasound was performed, showing a coarsened echotexture of the liver consistent with fatty liver and no ascites. The patient has a malpositioned right PICC line in the right atrium.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, depression, cirrhosis, and multiple admissions for opiate overdose. She presented with lethargy in the setting of drug intoxication and transient hypoglycemia. She was given Narcan, which responded well, but then showed signs of opiate withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated blood pressure. Her respiratory support is not required. Physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished and overweight, with crackles in the bases of her lungs. Her extremities are edematous. Lab results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, with low albumin. The patient has been diagnosed with nongap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, transient hypoglycemia, cirrhosis, anemia, chronic lung disease/BOOP, and FEN. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Opiate withdrawal: The patient is currently showing signs of opiate withdrawal after being given Narcan. This may lead to increased agitation and discomfort.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it is important to monitor for any sudden drops in blood pressure, which can lead to shock.
3. Respiratory issues: Although the patient's respiratory support is not currently required, her crackles in the lung bases suggest possible pulmonary edema or infection. Monitoring for any worsening respiratory symptoms is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, and multiple drug overdoses, presenting to the ER with lethargy. The patient responded to narcan but is still heavily sedated. There are no clear infectious sources, and metabolic disturbances are mild. The patient has acute renal failure, non-gap metabolic acidosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, volume overload, withdrawal symptoms, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic low back pain, thrush, anemia, chronic lung disease/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are receiving various medications including diuretics, anticoagulants, antibiotics, and analgesics. The patient's family has reported only opiate abuse, but the patient's daughter denies etoh use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's lethargy could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy due to his history of cirrhosis.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require ongoing management with dialysis.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's blood sugar levels are currently within normal range, there is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, and multiple drug overdoses, presenting to the ER with lethargy. The patient responded to narcan but took a long time to clear, raising concerns of secondary hepatic encephalopathy. There is no clear infectious source at this time, and metabolic disturbances are mild based on laboratory data. The patient's hypoglycemia has resolved. The patient is heavily sedated and will continue on the [**Doctor Last Name 2558**] scale, titrated as directed. Narcan will be held unless the patient is non-responsive or in respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.8 and has improved with IV fluids and diuresis. The patient's renal function is now stable after restarting ACE inhibitors and diuretics yesterday. However, the patient will continue to restart lasix today and hold ACE inhibitors, restarting them as needed. The goal is to achieve a net output of 1 liter.
2. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis has resolved.
3. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood sugar levels were low in the ER, so insulin administration was held. Fingersticks will be checked every two hours. The patient is not taking oral medications, and fingersticks are trending upwards overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, cirrhosis, and multiple admissions for opiate overdoses. She presents with lethargy in the setting of drug intoxication, transient hypoglycemia, and low-grade fever.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Lethargy/Delirium: The patient has been lethargic and delirious, possibly due to opiate intoxication. Narcan was administered, leading to withdrawal symptoms. The patient's lethargy/delirium has lingered, and further workup is needed to assess for a metabolic component.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia, which may be related to the drug intoxication. Blood glucose levels were in the range of 64-75 mg/dL.

3. Hypoventilation/Hypoventilation: The patient had hypoventilation/hypoventilation from narcotics. ABG results showed no significant CO2 retention.

4. Slightly More Alert: The patient is slightly more alert this morning but remains lethargic.

5. Repeat Narcan Dose: A repeat dose of Narcan should be considered.

6. Recheck ABG for CO2: Rechecking the ABG for CO2 levels is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), depression, cirrhosis, and multiple prior admissions for opiate overdoses. She presents with lethargy, transient hypoglycemia, and low-grade fever. The patient's vital signs show hypertension, and her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and elevated liver enzymes. She has been diagnosed with various conditions including delirium, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, anemia, chronic lung disease/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and potential hepatic encephalopathy (HE). She is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating a risk of hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

2. Infection: Despite the absence of new symptoms or findings, there is a possibility of infection due to the presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and low-grade fever. Regular assessment and appropriate cultures should be obtained if any signs of infection develop.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication. It is important to optimize antihypertensive therapy and closely monitor blood pressure to"
