","The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction. He presents with increased somnolence, which is believed to be due to hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to increased use of pain medication (percocet and fentanyl). The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, with a current oxygen saturation of 90%. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/69 mmHg to 152/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 of 90%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but has poor dentition and muscle wasting. Neurological examination reveals decreased muscle tone and strength. 

The patient's laboratory results show a TCO2 level of 49 and elevated lactic acid levels at 1.9 mmol/L. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely caused by CO2 narcosis and hypoventilation due to increased pain medication use. The plan is to discontinue steroids and antibiotics, continue supplemental oxygen with a target range of 88-92%, and continue bronchodilator therapy as needed.
2. Agitation/confusion:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, coronary artery disease, and a history of myocardial infarction. He presents with increased somnolence. The patient has been on home oxygen and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure after increased pain medication use. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he requires supplemental oxygen with an aim of 88-92%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has decreased breath sounds diffusely. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin, albuterol, atrovent, and others. His lab results show an elevated TCO2 level of 49 and increased lactic acid level of 1.9 mmol/L. The patient's neurologic examination is normal. The assessment and plan include discontinuing steroids and antibiotics, continuing supplemental oxygen, and managing pain with limited Percocet administration. The patient's agitation and confusion are likely due to narcotics and worsened by narcan administration. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be transferred to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's increased CO2 levels can lead to respiratory acidosis, which may require further intervention such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation.
2. CO2 narcosis: The high levels of CO2 can cause central nervous system depression, leading to confusion and decreased"

   69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   CAD (s/p , GERD, depression and chronic back pain on multiple sedating
   pain medications and psychiatric medications who presented with AMS,
   hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory distress / COPD : Most likely etiology is
   narcotic and BZD induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD
   retainer status at baseline. Patient is taking fentanyl patch, Percocet
   & Ativan at home.  Unlikely an underlying infection with  COPD
   exacerbation given his normal WBC count, lack of fevers, and normal
   CXR. Also unclear if he is compliant with his home oxygen.
   .
   -plan to continue on 4L NC with goal O2 sats >90%
   -f/up interval CXR read today
   -f/up blood cultures
   -continue on albuterol, ipratropium nebs q4hrs PRN
   -continue current 20mg Prednisone for COPD, adding Azithromycin as well
   x 5 days
   -continue daily Advair
   -continue PPx Bactrim)
   .
   #agitation/confusion: Likely secondary to hypercarbia and narcotics as
   outlined above. Half life of recently removed fentanyl patches ( 2)
   still lingering x 24 hours. CT head r/o any acute process.
   -continue to monitor O2 sats, ABGs
   - place order for ativan PRN
   -can add PRN Haldol if becomes belligerent  or refractory to Ativan
   - consider repeat ABD
   .
   #Right sided weakness: Subtle weakness with right sided hand grasp,
   other CNs [**2-17**] all normal on exam. Neurology service saw patient in ED
   and felt no acute exam focal findings, CT head negative. Recommended a
   f/up CTA which was ordered in ED. Recent slurred speech resolved now
   and was most likely secondary to his narcotics.
   -ff/up additional neurology recs
   -repeat neuro exam in afternoon , currently unremarkable
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Past medical history significant for prior
   NSTEMI in [**2101**]. He has no c/o current chest pain or palpitations.
   -continue on telemetry
   -continue usual home daily ASA 81mg
   -continue daily pravastatin
   #. Hypertension: Currently normotensive and stable. BPs in
   120-130s/60-70s range.

   69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   CAD (s/p , GERD, depression and chronic back pain on multiple sedating
   pain medications and psychiatric medications who presented with AMS,
   hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Most likely etiology is narcotic and
   BZD induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD retainer
   status at baseline. Patient is taking fentanyl patch, Percocet & Ativan
   at home.  Unlikely an underlying infection with  COPD exacerbation
   given his normal WBC count, lack of fevers, and normal CXR. Also
   unclear if he is compliant with his home oxygen.
   .
   -plan to continue on 4L NC overnight with goal O2 sats >90%
   -place back on BIPAP if desaturates
   -recheck ABG on current NC

   still lingering x 24 hours. CT head r/o any acute process.
   -continue to monitor O2 sats, ABGs
   -PRN Haldol if becomes belligerent
   .
   #Right sided weakness: Subtle weakness with right sided hand grasp,
   other CNs [**2-17**] all normal on exam. Neurology service saw patient in ED
   and felt no acute exam focal findings, CT head negative. Recommended a
   f/up CTA which was ordered in ED. Recent slurred speech resolved now
   and was most likely secondary to his narcotics.
   -f/up final read of CT
   -f/up formal neurology notes
   -repeat neuro exam in morning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease (prior NSTEMI), depression, chronic back pain, and GERD. He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been on high-flow nasal cannula (4L NC), BIPAP, and various medications including narcotics, benzodiazepines, and psychiatric medications. He also has a history of chronic pain management with sedating pain medications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/54 mmHg to 120/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's blood glucose level is 143 mg/dL, and his white blood cell count is normal.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The most likely etiology is narcotic and BZD-induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD retainer status at baseline. The patient is taking fentanyl patch, Percocet, and Ativan at home. It is unlikely an underlying infection with COPD exacerbation given his normal WBC count, lack of fevers, and normal chest X-ray. Also, unclear if he is compliant with his home oxygen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been tolerating BiPAP overnight. The patient has allergies to Levaquin (oral) and has received antibiotics (Azithromycin) previously. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/190 mmHg to 115/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. His physical examination reveals poor dentition, use of BiPAP, diminished pulses in the extremities, muscle wasting, cool skin, and attentive behavior with normal neurologic findings. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels, along with decreased potassium and calcium levels. Imaging shows hyperinflated lungs bilaterally without any infiltrates. The patient's prognosis is described as grave due to the severity of his underlying COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right-sided weakness: Although the patient has shown no current evidence of right-sided weakness, it should be monitored due to the possibility of neurological complications. A head CT within normal limits suggests no acute neurological issues at present.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease (s/p NSTEMI), depression, and chronic back pain. He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has a history of taking sedating narcotics and benzodiazepines at home.

Over the course of his ICU stay, the patient's agitation and confusion have improved slowly. It was determined that these symptoms were likely due to hypercarbia and narcotics. The patient continues to receive Klonopin and Ativan for agitation, with the option to add PRN Haldol if necessary.

The patient's coronary artery disease is being managed with a cardiac diet and he has no current chest pain or palpitations. However, he has a past medical history of NSTEMI in 2011.

The patient's depression is stable with no suicidal ideation. He is currently on Sertraline 50 mg and continues to receive Klonopin and Ativan for anxiety and agitation.

Regarding his chronic back pain, the patient's sedating narcotics have been held due to concerns about decreased respirations and somnolence. The palliative and pain service are now following up with him.

The patient's diet is cardiac-focused, and he has been started on bowel regimen with Senna, Colace, Miralax, and Lactulose. His access includes 20g and 22g lines"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting with acute exacerbation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and a respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall negative balance of 300 mL since 10 AM. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), with decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and hematocrit (Hct). The blood glucose level is within normal range, but other lab values such as total bilirubin (T Bili) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are slightly elevated. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including lorazepam (Ativan) and morphine for agitation and comfort. The patient's condition appears to be stable, but there is a potential risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers due to prolonged ICU stay and sedation. Additionally, the patient's COPD exacerbation may progress if not managed appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan:
   69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   CAD (s/p , GERD, depression and chronic back pain on multiple sedating
   pain medications and psychiatric medications who presented with AMS,
   hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory distress / COPD : Most likely etiology is
   narcotic and BZD induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD
   retainer status at baseline. Patient is taking fentanyl patch, Percocet
   & Ativan at home.  Unlikely an underlying infection with  COPD
   exacerbation given his normal WBC count, lack of fevers, and normal
   CXR. Also unclear if he is compliant with his home oxygen.
   .
   -plan to continue on 4L NC with goal O2 sats >90%
   -f/up interval CXR read today
   -f/up blood cultures
   -continue on albuterol, ipratropium nebs q4hrs PRN
   -continue current 20mg Prednisone for COPD, adding Azithromycin as well
   x 5 days
   -continue daily Advair
   -continue PPx Bactrim)
   .
   #agitation/confusion: Likely secondary to hypercarbia and narcotics as
   outlined above. Half life of recently removed fentanyl patches ( 2)
   still lingering x 24 hours. CT head r/o any acute process.
   -continue to monitor O2 sats, ABGs
   - place order for ativan PRN
   -can add PRN Haldol if becomes belligerent  or refractory to Ativan
   - consider repeat ABD
   .
   #Right sided weakness: Subtle weakness with right sided hand grasp,
   other CNs [**2-17**] all normal on exam. Neurology service saw patient in ED
   and felt no acute exam focal findings, CT head negative. Recommended a
   f/up CTA which was ordered in ED. Recent slurred speech resolved now
   and was most likely secondary to his narcotics.
   -ff/up additional neurology recs
   -repeat neuro exam in afternoon , currently unremarkable
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Past medical history significant for prior
   NSTEMI in [**2101**]. He has no c/o current chest pain or palpitations.
   -continue on telemetry
   -continue usual home daily ASA 81mg
   -continue daily pravastatin
   #. Hypertension: Currently normotensive and stable. BPs in
   120-130s/60-70s range.
   - continue on home Lisinopril 5 mg daily
   .
   #Depression: Mood stable. Denies any suicidal ideation.
   - continue Sertraline 50 mg
   - hold Ativan for now given recent over-sedation
   - SW consult
   .
   #. Chronic Back Pain:  Given concern for decreased respirations and
   somnolence with hypercarbia will hold sedating narcotics for now.
   Palliative and pain service now following.
   - f/up additional palliative team recs, appreciate input
   - continue on ATC Tylenol,
   - start lidocaine patch today
   -will add low dose PRN oxycodone once more stable
   -holding fentanyl patch and percocet
   -.
   #. GERD: Denies active reflux symptoms, stable without complaints.
   -continue on home Protonix 40mg PO daily
   .
   #BPH: urine output currently within normal limits, will plan to
   continue usual home Finasteride 5mg PO daily
   .
   #FEN:  cardiac diet
   #Access: got 20g and 22g
   #PPX: continue usual home PPI as above, bowel regimen with Senna,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease (s/p NSTEMI), depression, chronic back pain, and other medical conditions. He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 mmHg to 173/190 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination shows diffuse wheezes with expiration over both lung fields, normal cardiovascular system examination, and intact neurologic examination. Laboratory results indicate an elevated leukocyte count of 11.6 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL. Imaging studies such as a chest X-ray and CT head were performed, but no significant findings were mentioned.

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines the following potential medical complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress/COPD exacerbation: This is likely due to narcotic and benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD retainers status at baseline. The patient is on fentanyl patch, Percocet, and Ativan at home. The plan includes continuing 4L NC with goal O2 sats >90%, follow-up interval CXR, follow-up blood cultures, and continuing current medications.
2. Agitation/confusion: This is likely secondary to hypercarbia and narcotics. The patient's agitation and confusion may be attributed to the lingering effects of fentanyl patches. Monitoring O2 sats, ABGs, and administering Ativan PRN are part of the plan. Haldol can be added if the patient becomes belligerent or refractory to Ativan.
3. Right-sided weakness: The patient has subtle weakness with right-sided hand grasp, but other cranial nerves are normal on examination. Neurology service recommended a follow-up CTA, which was ordered. The recent slurred speech resolved and was most likely secondary to narcotics. The plan includes repeat neuro exam in the afternoon and following additional neurology recommendations.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of prior NSTEMI. He is currently stable without any chest pain or palpitations. Telemetry is continued, and usual home medications are maintained.
5. Hypertension: The patient is currently normotensive and stable. The plan includes continuing home Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
6. Depression: The patient's mood is stable, and he denies any suicidal ideation. Sertraline 50 mg is continued, and Ativan is held due to recent over-sedation.
7. Chronic back pain: The patient's sedating narcotics are held due to concern for decreased respirations"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with end-stage COPD who was previously on 4L O2 at home. He presented with increased somnolence, which initially improved with BiPAP. The patient stated that he does not want any further aggressive medical treatment, including BiPAP, except for what will keep him comfortable. He received Lorazepam and Morphine for agitation and pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still critically ill. The family has agreed to transfer him to a hospice facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation/Anxiety: The patient may continue to experience episodes of agitation and anxiety, which can be managed with ongoing use of sedatives such as Lorazepam, Klonopin, Haldol, and Sertraline.
2. COPD Exacerbation: Although the patient's COPD exacerbation is currently stable, there is a risk of further exacerbations. Continued use of prednisone, azithromycin, bactrim, albuterol/atrovent, and advair can help manage the symptoms.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD is being managed by discontinuing statin and lisinopril. However, there is a risk of cardiac complications due to the patient's critical condition.
4. Pain: The patient may continue to experience pain, for which lidocaine patch and standing"
