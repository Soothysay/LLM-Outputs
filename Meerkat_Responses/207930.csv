   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o F w/ PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation, hyponatremia,
   afib on coumadin and recent fall presenting from OSH small punctate
   intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia.
   1) Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: likely in setting of being on
   anticoagulation and getting XRT as it is near the tumor mass and may be
   the result of a tumor related aneurym.
   -- apprec NSURG advice
   -- hold warfarin for 7 days
   -- patient already received 10 mg IV vit K
   -- cont antiseizure medications
   2) Hyponatremia: pt with hx prior adrenal mass resection for benign
   cause, on fludrocort at [**Hospital1 586**] in past 2 month, ? adrenal pathology as
   cause, vs brain XRT SIADH, vs pt dehydrated vs AED effect. Posm 246,
   Uosm 436. Random cortisol 4.
   -- check Ulytes - pending
   -- restart fludrocort in am, pending confirmation at [**Hospital1 586**]
   -- hypertonic saline 3% at 32 mg /hr.--- STOP if NA > 122, and then
   recheck
   -- previously on spironolactone (perhaps to counteract hypoK found with
   fludrocort?), will hold given unclear reason for med
   3) Intracranial Mass: 1.7 cm in left insula, primative neuroectodermal
   tumor (PNET), s/p craniotomy, getting palliative XRT
   -- cont decradron
   -- discuss with onc at OSH
   -- palliative care c/s
   -- Bactrim DS every other day, due [**7-9**] given on decadron
   4) Seizure d/o: cont keppra, clarify dose of carbamazepime and start in
   PM
   5) Hypothyroidism:
   -- start synthroid 25 mcg daily
   6) Afib s/p ablation and placement of cardiac pacer ([**2197**]),
   sub-therapeutic on presentation INR 1.3
   -- on Imdur for unclear reason, last received [**7-7**], if pressures
   tolerate will restart [**7-8**]
   -- hold coumadin given bleed as above
   7) Left Pubic Ramus Fx: conservative management, weight bearing as
   tolerated
   -- tylenol prn for pain
   8) Resection adrenal mass, benign ([**2183**]): pm cortisol 4, which is
   non-specific
   -- get records from [**Hospital1 586**]
   9) Restless Legs
   -- cont Gabapentin 100 mg QPM
   10) Constipation: bowel regimen
   11) Nausea: improved this am, felt to be related to intracranial
   pressure, patient on both PPI and H2 blocker:
   -- cont iv PPI
   -- cont decadron
   12) Osteoporosis:
   --restart oscal + D as soon as able to take PO
   -- Vit D 50,000 unit once monthly, last given [**6-26**]
   13) Hyperglycemia: on decadron, trend BG, treat if > 200
   14) Leukocytosis: neg CXR, equivocal UA, may be due to ICH and/or fall.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation. The patient presented with hyponatremia, altered mental status, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/48-111/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished but has blurry vision, bruising on the left temporal and posterior head area, and normal cardiovascular findings. The patient's extremities are absent on the right side but present on the left side. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person and season. However, the patient's movement and tone are not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia with a sodium level of 115-116 mg/dL. Other lab values include a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 150 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 129 mg/dL, and a potassium level of 4."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation.
- She presents with hyponatremia, altered mental status, and intracranial hemorrhage.
- She has been on anticoagulation therapy and recently received radiation treatment, which may have contributed to the intracranial hemorrhage.
- The patient also has a history of prior adrenal mass resection for benign cause and is currently on fludrocortisone.
- Her sodium levels are low, and she is receiving hypertonic saline.
- She has an intracranial mass measuring 1.7 cm in the left insula, diagnosed as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), for which she has undergone craniotomy and is receiving palliative radiation.
- She has several other medical conditions including hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, a left hip fracture, restless legs syndrome, constipation, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: This is likely due to being on anticoagulation and receiving radiation therapy, which could have caused bleeding near the tumor mass.
2. Hyponatremia: The cause of hyponatremia is unclear, with possible contributing factors including adrenal pathology, brain radiation-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion"

","The patient's chief complaint is hyponatremia, which has been corrected with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline. The patient also has a history of an intracranial hemorrhage and is on anticoagulation therapy. There are multiple medical complications that can arise in this case. 

1) Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: This may be a result of anticoagulation therapy and could potentially lead to increased intracranial pressure or further bleeding.

2) Hyponatremia: The cause of hyponatremia needs to be determined, as it can be due to adrenal pathology, brain XRT-induced SIADH, dehydration, or the effect of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Appropriate treatment should be initiated based on the underlying cause.

3) Intracranial Mass: The patient has a 1.7 cm left insula primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), which is being treated with palliative radiation therapy. Close monitoring and management of the tumor's effects are necessary.

4) Seizure disorder: The patient requires continued antiseizure medication.

5) Hypothyroidism: The patient has started on synthroid 25 mcg daily for hypothyroidism.

6) Atrial fibrillation (afib): The patient has a history of afib, which was managed with ablation and placement of a cardiac pacemaker. The patient's INR was sub-"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia, which was corrected with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline. However, the sodium levels trended back down to 117.
2. The patient has a history of an adrenal mass resection for a benign cause, and there is a possibility of adrenal pathology as a cause of the hyponatremia.
3. The patient has an intracranial mass, identified as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), which was previously treated with craniotomy and is currently receiving palliative radiation therapy.
4. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and is on coumadin. There was a recent fall resulting in a small punctate intracranial hemorrhage. The neurosurgery team advised holding warfarin for 7 days and reversing it with vitamin K.
5. The patient has a left pubic ramus fracture, which is being managed conservatively with weight-bearing as tolerated.
6. The patient has a history of resected adrenal mass, which was determined to be benign.
7. The patient is experiencing restless legs and is being treated with gabapentin.
8. The patient has constipation and is on a bowel regimen.
9. The patient has nausea, which is believed to be related to intracranial pressure. The patient is on"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) undergoing palliative radiation, hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and a recent fall. She presented with a small punctate intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: This is likely due to anticoagulation therapy and radiation treatment near the tumor mass.
2. Hyponatremia: The cause of hyponatremia is uncertain, but it could be related to adrenal pathology, brain XRT SIADH, dehydration, or AED effect.
3. Intracranial Mass: A 1.7 cm left insula mass, identified as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), which has been treated with craniotomy and palliative XRT.
4. Seizure Disorder: The patient is on carbamazepine and keppra for seizure management.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has been started on synthroid 25 mcg daily.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had undergone ablation and placement of a cardiac pacer. Her INR was sub-therapeutic on presentation.
7. Left Pubic Ramus Fracture: Conservative management with weight-bearing as tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) undergoing palliative radiation. She presented with hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and a recent fall. The patient has a punctate intracranial hemorrhage, which is likely due to anticoagulation and radiation therapy. She also has hyponatremia, which could be caused by adrenal pathology, brain radiation-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), dehydration, or antiepileptic drug (AED) effect. The patient's sodium levels are being monitored closely.

Other medical conditions and plans include:
1) Intracranial Mass: The patient has a 1.7 cm left insula mass, which is a PNET. She underwent craniotomy and is receiving palliative radiation therapy.
2) Seizure Disorder: The patient is on carbamazepine and keppra for seizure management.
3) Hypothyroidism: The patient started on synthroid 25 mcg daily.
4) Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had ablation and placement of a cardiac pacemaker. Her INR is sub-therapeutic on presentation.
5) Left Pubic Ramus Fracture: Conservative management with weight bearing as tolerated.
6) Resection of Adrenal Mass: The mass was benign, and the patient's cortisol level"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation. She presents with hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and a recent fall. She has a small punctate intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia. The patient has multiple medical conditions including impaired balance, gait, knowledge, transfers, and ventilation. She also has altered mental status, hypothyroidism, thrombocytopenia, seizure disorder, and a history of adrenal mass resection for benign cause.

The patient is currently on several medications including antiseizure medications, warfarin, Bactrim DS every other day, cefpodoxime proxetil, and others. She has a left pubic ramus fracture managed conservatively, restless legs syndrome, constipation, and nausea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and radiation treatment near the tumor mass.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma. It needs to be managed carefully.

3. Impaired Balance, Gait, Knowledge, Transfers, and Ventilation: These impairments increase the risk of falls and injuries.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation. She has been admitted to the ICU with small punctate intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia. The patient's medical history includes a prior adrenal mass resection for benign cause, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, recent fall, and osteoporosis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy and receiving radiation treatment near the tumor mass. This increases the risk of further bleeding or development of a tumor-related aneurysm.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can be caused by various factors such as adrenal pathology, brain XRT-induced SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone), dehydration, or the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

3. Intracranial Mass: The patient has a 1.7 cm left insula mass, diagnosed as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), which has undergone craniotomy and will receive palliative radiation therapy.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, possibly due to intracranial hemorrhage and/or fall. It is improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) undergoing palliative radiation. She has hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and a recent fall resulting in small punctate intracranial hemorrhage. The patient is also hypothyroid and has a history of adrenal mass resection for benign cause. She is being treated for various medical conditions including impaired balance, gait, knowledge, transfers, ventilation, altered mental status, and punctate intracranial hemorrhage. The patient is on anticoagulation and receiving external beam radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient's recent fall and being on anticoagulation increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This condition may worsen if the patient continues to bleed or if there is expansion of the hemorrhage.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and respiratory distress if not managed properly.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. It is important to monitor her heart rate and consider anticoagulation therapy.
4. Impaired Balance and Gait: The patient's impaired balance and gait may increase the risk of falls and injuries.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation. She presents with small punctate intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia. The patient is on anticoagulation and is scheduled to receive XRT. She has a past medical history of adrenal mass resection for benign cause, possible adrenal pathology, SIADH, dehydration, and AED effect. She is also experiencing anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, left pubic ramus fracture, restless legs syndrome, constipation, nausea, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Punctate Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient is on anticoagulation and is receiving XRT, which increases the risk of bleeding in the brain. This can lead to neurological deficits or worsening of her current symptoms.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can cause confusion, seizures, or cardiac abnormalities. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of hyponatremia.
3. Adrenal Pathology: Given the patient's history of adrenal mass resection, there is a possibility of an adrenal pathology contributing to her current symptoms. This needs to be considered and ruled out through appropriate diagnostic tests.
4. SIADH: The patient may have Syndrome"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor, undergoing palliative radiation, hyponatremia, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. She presented from OSH with a small punctate intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia. The patient has a past medical history of prior adrenal mass resection for benign cause, unclear reason for medication spironolactone, and recent fall. 

The patient is currently being held on warfarin due to the intracranial hemorrhage and is scheduled to start radiation therapy on Monday. She has several ongoing medical issues, including punctate intracranial hemorrhage, hyponatremia, intracranial mass (PNET), E. coli UTI, left pubic ramus fracture, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, restless legs syndrome, constipation, nausea, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/69 to 137/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of PNET tumor undergoing palliative radiation, hyponatremia, and recent fall. She presents with small punctate intracranial hemorrhage and hyponatremia. The patient has a background of prior adrenal mass resection for benign cause, possible adrenal pathology as a cause, versus brain XRT SIADH, versus patient dehydration versus AED effect. The patient's sodium levels have been stable between 119 and 122.

The patient is on anticoagulation therapy and is undergoing radiation treatment, which increases the risk of bleeding. The warfarin medication has been held for 7 days. The patient continues to be on antiseizure medications.

The patient has several other medical issues including an intracranial mass, E. coli UTI, left pubic ramus fracture managed conservatively, leukocytosis resolved, anemia, thrombocytopenia, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation after ablation with placement of cardiac pacemaker, resection of adrenal mass, restless legs syndrome, constipation, nausea, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia.
