   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration).
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear,
   but differential includes pneumonia (?aspiration event with
   nausea/vomiting), flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension,
   ARDS, pneumonitis. Rapid resolution of infiltrate on CXR is highly
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient's acute onset of
   symptoms, hypertension, blood tinged hemoptysis and ET suctioning, BNP
   of 20,000 c/w pulmonary edema.  However, patient is febrile, on
   immumnosuppressants and has unilateral infiltrate on CXR suggestive of
   an infectious process ( negative sputum gram stain though).  Therefore,
   will cover with broad antibiotic coverage.  Appearance of secretions
   during bronch were consistent with CHF.  With increased sedation
   overnight, patient was able to be weaned significantly from FIO2 of 80
   down to 40, PEEP remains at 12.
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)
   - CMV viral load
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal
   - send sputum culture
   - r/o PCP given patient is on immunosuppressants, though only on 5 mg
   of prednisone daily
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - follow CVPs and gentle bolus fluids to keep CVP 8-12
   - wean FIO2, PEEP as tolerated
   - check glucan, galactomannan
   - aggressive sedation to keep patient comfortable and not dysyncrhonous
   with [**Known lastname **]
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, will try to
   maintain SBP < 110.  However, patient became hypotensive in setting of
   increasing sedation and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic
   shock.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60, consider dopamine if a second
   pressor needs to be added
   - consider labetolol drip if hypertensive off pressors again
   - small fluid boluses if needed due to worsening renal failure and high
   Fio2
   .
   4.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 and only 30 cc of urine over 6 hours.   Patient is getting
   evaluated for possible second transplant.   Given fluid overload,
   patient may require initiation of dialysis.  Falling bicarb and rising
   creatinine also due to worsening renal failure.
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - continue epo, zemplar
   - continue sirolimus
   - hold tacrolimus per renal
   - check sirolums level
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize fluid boluses given patients low urine output and high FIO2
   requirements
   .
   5.  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].
   - monitor fluid status
   - repeat Echo to further elucidate etiology of respiratory failure
   (?chf)
   - ROMI
   - daily EKGs
   .
   7.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on
   [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.
   - continue epo
   - tx to 21

","Summary:
Ms. [**Last Name (LF)**], a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant, was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia (?aspiration). The etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may include pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, or pneumonitis. The patient has been febrile, on immunosuppressants, and has a unilateral infiltrate on CXR suggestive of an infectious process. Therefore, broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated. Secretions during bronchoscopic evaluation were consistent with CHF. The patient's condition has improved with increased sedation, allowing for weaning from FIO2 of 80 to 40, while PEEP remains at 12.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to various causes such as pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, or pneumonitis. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and respiratory status closely.
2. Hypotension: The patient has ESRD and hypertension at baseline. In the ED, the patient was hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, an effort will be made to maintain SBP < 110. However, the patient became hypotensive in the setting of increasing sedation and fever, raising concerns for medication effect versus septic shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration).
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear,
   but differential includes pneumonia (?aspiration event with
   nausea/vomiting), flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension,
   ARDS, pneumonitis.  Patient's acute onset of symptoms, hypertension,
   blood tinged hemoptysis and ET suctioning, BNP of 20,000 c/w pulmonary
   edema.  However, patient is febrile, on immumnosuppressants and has
   unilateral infiltrate on CXR suggestive of an infectious process (
   negative sputum gram stain though).  Therefore, will cover with broad
   antibiotic coverage.  Appearance of secretions during bronch were
   consistent with CHF.  With increased sedation overnight, patient was
   able to be weaned significantly from FIO2 of 80 down to 40, PEEP
   remains at 12.
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)
   - CMV viral load
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal
   - send sputum culture
   - r/o PCP given patient is on immunosuppressants, though only on 5 mg
   of prednisone daily
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - follow CVPs and gentle bolus fluids to keep CVP 8-12
   - ARDSnet ventilation
   - check glucan, galactomannan
   - aggressive sedation to keep patient comfortable and not dysyncrhonous
   with [**Known lastname **]
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, will try to
   maintain SBP < 110.  However, patient became hypotensive in setting of
   increasing sedation and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic
   shock.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60, consider dopamine if a second
   pressor needs to be added
   - consider labetolol drip if hypertensive off pressors again
   - small fluid boluses if needed due to worsening renal failure and high
   Fio2
   .
   4.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 and only 30 cc of urine over 6 hours.   Patient is getting
   evaluated for possible second transplant.   Given fluid overload,
   patient may require initiation of dialysis.  Falling bicarb and rising
   creatinine also due to worsening renal failure.
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - continue epo, zemplar
   - continue sirolimus
   - hold tacrolimus per renal
   - check sirolums level
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize fluid boluses given patients low urine output and high FIO2
   requirements
   .
   5.  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].
   - monitor fluid status
   - repeat Echo to further elucidate etiology of respiratory failure
   (?chf)
   - ROMI
   - daily EKGs
   .
   7.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on
   [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.
   - continue epo
   - tx to 21

","Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and the etiology is unclear. Differential diagnoses include pneumonia (possibly aspiration), flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension, ARDS, and pneumonitis. The patient has been covered with broad antibiotic coverage, and measures are being taken to wean off oxygen and improve ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of ESRD and hypertension at baseline. In the ED, the patient was hypertensive, but now they have become hypotensive. This could be due to the increasing sedation and fever, or it may indicate septic shock. Pressor support with levophed and dopamine is being considered to maintain MAPs above 60.

3. ESRD s/p renal transplant: The patient underwent renal transplant in 2152 but has had rising creatinine levels over the past few months. Currently, the patient has a creatinine level of 5.5 and low urine output. This indicates worsening renal failure, and the patient may require initiation of dialysis. 

4. Type 1 DM: The patient now has hyperglycemia and an anion gap of 16, putting them at risk for development of DKA. Insulin drip is being maintained to keep the fasting blood sugar between 80 and 120.

   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS.
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)
   - CMV viral load
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean FIO2, PEEP as tolerated and change to PS ventilation.
   >  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, became
   hypotensive in the setting of labetalol raising concern for infectious
   vs caridogenic  and possibly compounded by falling Hct
   - Check TTE today to assess for decompensation of ventricular function.
   - Continue to follow cardiac enzymes.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60, consider dopamine if a second
   pressor needs to be added
   - Stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone usage.
   .
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte mangement
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize fluid boluses given patients low urine output and high FIO2
   requirements
   .
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - Start reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   >  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].
   - TTE
   - monitor fluid status
   - daily EKGs
   >  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history including Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post failed transplant in [**2152**], and nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 20%. The patient was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) versus pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy due to her compromised lung function. There is a possibility of further deterioration in respiratory function if not closely monitored and managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline. She experienced hypotension in the emergency department during treatment for flash pulmonary edema. This may indicate ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation, possibly compounded by her chronic kidney disease.

3. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a severely reduced EF, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, particularly if there is further decompensation of ventricular function.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Despite the patient's Type 1 DM, there are no current ketones in the urine. However, she is at risk for"

She was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) versus pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST mode, indicating respiratory support. There is a need to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated and change to pressure support ventilation (PS). The rapid resolution of her respiratory symptoms suggests the possibility of an inflammatory lung condition.

2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of ESRD and hypertension at baseline. She became hypotensive in the setting of labetalol administration, raising concerns for infectious or cardiac causes, compounded by falling hematocrit (Hct). Sedation may also contribute to hypotension.

3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an elevated BUN level of 38.3 on 07-14, indicating potential electrolyte disturbances. This could be related to renal dysfunction and the ongoing use of diuretics.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS.
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)pending final results on clx
   data
   - CMV viral load
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean FIO2, PEEP as tolerated and change to PS ventilation.
   >  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, became
   hypotensive in the setting of labetalol raising concern for infectious
   vs caridogenic  and possibly compounded by falling Hct. Finally
   sedation is likely contributing to the hypotension.
   - Check TTE today to assess for decompensation of ventricular function.
   - Continue to follow cardiac enzymes.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60,
   - Stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone usage.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte mangement
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize fluid boluses given patients low urine output and high FIO2
   requirements
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - Start reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   >  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].
   - TTE
   - monitor fluid status
   - daily EKGs
   >  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on
   [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.
   - transuse 1U pRBC

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant, admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia in the setting of progressive renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has likely multifactorial respiratory failure, which may be due to renal failure with volume overload, depressed EF of 15%, aspiration event, and an inflammatory lung condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline. She experienced hypotension in the ED, possibly due to flash pulmonary edema or infection. Sedation and falling Hct may also contribute to hypotension.
3. ESRD s/p renal transplant: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate the need for initiation of HD prior to extubation to assist with volume control and electrolyte management.
4. Type 1 DM: The patient is now hyperglycemic with a high anion gap. She is at risk for development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
5. Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly low ejection fraction (EF < 20). There is a need for further cardiac evaluation, monitoring fluid status, and daily EKGs.
6. Anemia: The patient has widely fluctuating Hct levels. Transfusion of packed red blood cells"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant, admitted
   with respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia
   (?aspiration).
   >Respiratory failure.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but
   differential includes pneumonia (?aspiration event with
   nausea/vomiting), flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension,
   ARDS, pneumonitis. Rapid resolution of infiltrate on CXR is highly
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient's acute onset of
   symptoms, hypertension, blood tinged hemoptysis and ET suctioning, BNP
   of 20,000 c/w pulmonary edema.  However, patient is febrile, on
   immumnosuppressants and has unilateral infiltrate on CXR suggestive of
   an infectious process ( negative sputum gram stain though).  Therefore,
   will cover with broad antibiotic coverage.  Appearance of secretions
   during bronch were consistent with CHF.  With increased sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD secondary to a failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure. The etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be due to pneumonia (possibly aspiration), flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, pneumonitis, or an infectious process. The patient has been febrile, on immunosuppressants, and has unilateral infiltrate on CXR suggestive of an infectious process. She is being covered with broad antibiotic coverage. Secretions during bronchoscopies were consistent with CHF. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has been hypotensive in the setting of increasing sedation and fever, which could be due to medication effect or septic shock. She also has ESRD and hypertension at baseline. The patient's renal function is worsening, and she may require initiation of dialysis. She also has hyperglycemia and anion gap metabolic acidosis, putting her at risk for development of DKA. Additionally, she has nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction <20 on most recent echo. Her hemoglobin levels have been fluctuating, indicating anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory failure, such as increased oxygen requirements, changes in vital signs, or decreased breath sounds.
2. Infection: Given the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration).
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear,
   but differential includes pneumonia (?aspiration event with
   nausea/vomiting), flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension,
   ARDS, pneumonitis. Rapid resolution of infiltrate on CXR is highly
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient's acute onset of
   symptoms, hypertension, blood tinged hemoptysis and ET suctioning, BNP
   of 20,000 c/w pulmonary edema.  However, patient is febrile, on
   immumnosuppressants and has unilateral infiltrate on CXR suggestive of
   an infectious process ( negative sputum gram stain though).  Therefore,
   will cover with broad antibiotic coverage.  Appearance of secretions
   during bronch were consistent with CHF.  With increased sedation
   overnight, patient was able to be weaned significantly from FIO2 of 80
   down to 40, PEEP remains at 12.
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)
   - CMV viral load
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal
   - send sputum culture

   - wean FIO2, PEEP as tolerated
   - check glucan, galactomannan
   - aggressive sedation to keep patient comfortable and not dysyncrhonous
   with vent
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, will try to
   maintain SBP < 110.  However, patient became hypotensive in setting of
   increasing sedation and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic

   pressor needs to be added
   - consider labetolol drip if hypertensive off pressors again
   - small fluid boluses if needed due to worsening renal failure and high
   Fio2
   .
   4.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 and only 30 cc of urine over 6 hours.   Patient is getting

   5.  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].
   - monitor fluid status
   - repeat Echo to further elucidate etiology of respiratory failure
   (?chf)
   - ROMI

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia (?aspiration). The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension, ARDS, pneumonitis, and aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's symptoms, such as acute onset of symptoms, hypertension, blood-tinged hemoptysis, and ET suctioning, along with a BNP of 20,000 c/w pulmonary edema, suggest a possible infectious process (negative sputum gram stain though). Therefore, broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

The patient's condition is complicated by several other conditions, including hypotension, ESRD s/p renal transplant, Type 1 DM, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and anemia. The patient's hypotension is attributed to ESRD and hypertension at baseline. Efforts are being made to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 110. However, the patient became hypotensive in the setting of increasing sedation and fever, raising concerns for medication effect versus septic shock.

The patient's ESRD s/p renal transplant is causing worsening renal failure, with a creatinine level of 5.5 and only 30 cc of urine output over 6 hours. The patient may require initiation of dialysis. Falling bicarbonate and rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who was admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonitis. They have been receiving mechanical ventilation and have shown improvement in their chest X-ray. The patient's renal function has been compromised, with elevated creatinine levels and limited urine output. Acidosis has also been present, but it has shown a slow trend upward. Central venous saturation has been above 80%. Lactate levels have been increasing, but the patient's urine output has improved towards the morning. 

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient initially presented with aspiration pneumonitis, which is an inflammation of the lungs caused by inhaling foreign substances like food or stomach acid. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of respiratory distress. This condition occurs when the lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygenation or remove carbon dioxide from the bloodstream.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This can be attributed to various factors such as dehydration, medication use, or underlying kidney disease. Renal failure may require dialysis for management.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's blood chemistry shows signs of metabolic acidosis, characterized by low pH and high lactate levels. Acidosis can result"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to ? aspiration
   pneumonitis versus steroid responsive pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear,
   but differential includes pneumonia (?aspiration event with
   nausea/vomiting), flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension,
   ARDS, pneumonitis. Rapid resolution of infiltrate on CXR is highly
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid responsive
   process.  Patient's acute onset of symptoms, hypertension, blood tinged
   hemoptysis and ET suctioning, BNP of 20,000 c/w pulmonary edema.
   However, patient is febrile, on immumnosuppressants and has unilateral
   infiltrate on CXR suggestive of an infectious process ( negative sputum
   gram stain though).  Therefore, will cover with broad antibiotic
   coverage.  Appearance of secretions during bronch were consistent with
   CHF.  There has been rapid improvement of vent settings in 1 day.
   Sputum cultures negative. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**].
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)
   - CMV viral load
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal
   - f/u blood cultures, sputum
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean PEEP to 5 as tolerated
   - wean sedation and then try for pressure support trial
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema so wanted to
   maintain SBP < 110.  However, patient became hypotensive in setting of
   increasing sedation and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic
   shock.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60
   .
   4.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 and only 30 cc of urine over 6 hours.   Patient is getting
   evaluated for possible second transplant.   Given fluid overload,
   patient may require initiation of dialysis.  Falling bicarb and rising
   creatinine also due to worsening renal failure and worsening
   hyperkalemia.  Will likely need CVVH.
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - continue epo, zemplar
   - continue sirolimus
   - hold tacrolimus per renal
   - check sirolums level
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize inputs given low UOP
   - start calcium acetate, nephrocaps
   .
   5.  Type 1 DM.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].  Had episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight.
   - repeat Echo to further elucidate etiology of respiratory failure
   (?chf)
   - ROMI
   - daily EKGs
   .
   7.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on
   [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.
   - continue epo
   - PRBC transfusion today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD secondary to a failed renal transplant, admitted with respiratory failure. The etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but possible causes include aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, or pneumonitis. The patient's symptoms, such as acute onset of symptoms, hypertension, blood-tinged hemoptysis, and ET suctioning, suggest aspiration pneumonitis or a steroid-responsive process. The patient is febrile, on immunosuppressants, and has a unilateral infiltrate on CXR, which is suggestive of an infectious process. Therefore, broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, likely due to ESRD and hypertension at baseline. The patient was hypertensive in the ED and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, but then became hypotensive in the setting of increasing sedation and fever, concerning for medication effect versus septic shock. Levophed has been started to maintain MAPs > 60.

The patient also has ESRD s/p renal transplant and is being evaluated for a possible second transplant. Rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal failure, and fluid overload may require initiation of dialysis. The patient's anemia is being managed with epo and PRBC transfusion.

Other conditions include nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with an EF < 20 on most"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella. Would fav
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)pending final results on clx
   data. Will d/c vancomycin today and plan for further titration of abx
   based on clx data.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, requiring [**10-11**]. Additional barrier includes
   altered MS (improving with hold on sedation)
   >  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, became
   hypotensive in the setting of labetalol raising concern for infectious
   vs caridogenic  and possibly compounded by falling Hct. Finally
   sedation is likely contributing to the hypotension.  TTE showing
   biventricular failure with worsened right sided function. Holding beta
   blocker and other empiric therapy for now.
   - Stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone usage, will
 dose
   today.
   - holding cardiac meds
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis
    >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: increase free water via tube feeds.
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - Start reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant in 2152. She was admitted with acute respiratory failure, which could be secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. The patient also has progressive renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 mmHg and is receiving fluids and medications through various lines. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in renal function tests, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count. Her chest X-ray shows an improving left-sided infiltrate, indicating possible improvement in the lung condition. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress if there is worsening of the lung condition or if the patient develops new complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's baseline hypertension and the use of sedation may contribute to hypotension. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS.
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)pending final results on clx
   data
   - CMV viral load
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean FIO2, PEEP as tolerated and change to PS ventilation.
   >  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, became
   hypotensive in the setting of labetalol raising concern for infectious
   vs caridogenic  and possibly compounded by falling Hct. Finally
   sedation is likely contributing to the hypotension.
   - Check TTE today to assess for decompensation of ventricular function.
   - Continue to follow cardiac enzymes.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60,
   - Stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone usage.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte mangement
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize fluid boluses given patients low urine output and high FIO2
   requirements
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - Start reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   >  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].
   - TTE
   - monitor fluid status
   - daily EKGs
   >  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on
   [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.
   - transuse 1U pRBC
   - continue epo

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD secondary to a failed transplant, admitted with acute respiratory failure due to CHF versus pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, ESRD requiring dialysis, Type 1 DM with hyperglycemia, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires close monitoring of respiratory parameters. Any deterioration in these parameters may indicate a worsening respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting a suspicion of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and positive cultures is important.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Monitoring for signs of cardiac decompensation, such as chest pain, dyspnea, and changes in vital signs, is crucial.
4. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis. Monitoring for worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload is essential.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has hyperglycemia and an elevated anion gap. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and acid-base balance is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM and ESRD who underwent a renal transplant in 2152. She was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia, possibly aspiration, in the setting of progressive renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial, including renal failure with volume overload, depressed left ventricular function, aspiration event, and inflammatory lung condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently hypotensive. Factors contributing to hypotension include ESRD, hypertensive medications, sedation, and possible infectious or cardiogenic causes.
3. Anemia: The patient did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which may require management through increased free water administration via tube feeds.
5. Type 1 DM with Hyperglycemia: The patient is at risk for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to hyperglycemia, bicarbonate level of 20, and anion gap of 16. Insulin therapy will be initiated to maintain blood glucose levels between 80-120 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to ? aspiration
   pneumonitis versus steroid responsive pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Likely two processes occurring.  Initially
   with high vent support and rapid improvement over 24 hours suggesting a
   steroid responsive element (?pneumonitis).  However, now has fevers,
   infiltrate on CXR, and moraxella in sputum suggestive of pneumonia.
   Will cover with zosyn/levaquin.  Viral panel negative.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of CHF given low urine output.
   - CMV viral load
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal, rising Cr
   - f/u blood cultures, sputum
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean sedation and then try for pressure support trial
   .
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline
   (on toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema.  However,
   patient became hypotensive in setting of increasing sedation and fever,
   concerning for med effect versus septic shock.  Now off pressors for >
   24 hours in setting of lightening sedation.
   -monitor bp
   - taper stress dose steroids
   .
   4.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   7.2 and with some urine output.   Patient is getting evaluated for
   possible second transplant as outpatient.   Given fluid overload,
   patient may require initiation of dialysis.  Falling bicarb and rising
   creatinine also due to worsening renal failure.  Will likely need HD at
   some point, but not emergently.
   - renal following
   - follow urine output
   - continue epo (increase dose per renal)
   - d/c zemplar
   - continue sirolimus
   - hold tacrolimus per renal
   - check sirolums level
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, but can wean today
   - minimize inputs given low UOP
   - start calcium acetate, nephrocaps
   - trial of lasix today
   .
   5.  Type 1 DM.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].  Had episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight two
   nights ago.  Has mildly elevated troponin and CK.  Echo is unchanged.
   - daily EKGs
   .
   7.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3
   prior to admissionon [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.  Poor response to
   blood transfusion yesterday, so will transfuse again.
   - increase epo dose per EPO
   - PRBC transfusion today
   .
   8.       Hypernatremia.
   - free water boluses through NGT
   - D5W
   - follow Na
   PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, VAP precautions
   FEN: tube feeds through NGT

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid-responsive pneumonia. This condition requires close monitoring and management.

2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is on medications for it. However, they became hypotensive during the course of their illness, which could be due to medication effects or septic shock. Monitoring blood pressure closely is essential.

3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant: The patient had a failed renal transplant and is now experiencing rising creatinine levels and fluid overload. They may require initiation of dialysis and further evaluation for a possible second transplant.

4. Type 1 diabetes mellitus: The patient has type 1 DM and requires careful management of their blood sugar levels with an insulin drip.

5. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (<20%) on most recent echocardiogram. This increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

6. Anemia: The patient has fluctuating hemoglobin levels and an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with a high red cell distribution width (RDW). This indicates the need for further investigation and management of the anemia.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which may"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to ? aspiration
   pneumonitis versus steroid responsive pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear,
   but differential includes pneumonia (?aspiration event with
   nausea/vomiting), flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension,
   ARDS, pneumonitis. Rapid resolution of infiltrate on CXR is highly
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid responsive
   process.  Patient's acute onset of symptoms, hypertension, blood tinged
   hemoptysis and ET suctioning, BNP of 20,000 c/w pulmonary edema.
   However, patient is febrile, on immumnosuppressants and has unilateral
   infiltrate on CXR suggestive of an infectious process ( negative sputum
   gram stain though).  Therefore, will cover with broad antibiotic
   coverage.  Appearance of secretions during bronch were consistent with
   CHF.  There has been rapid improvement of vent settings in 1 day.
   Sputum cultures negative. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**].
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)
   - CMV viral load
   - rapid respiratory viral panel
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal
   - f/u blood cultures, sputum
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean PEEP to 5 as tolerated
   - wean sedation and then try for pressure support trial
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema so wanted to
   maintain SBP < 110.  However, patient became hypotensive in setting of
   increasing sedation and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic
   shock.
   - levophed drip to maintain MAPs > 60
   .
   4.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 and only 30 cc of urine over 6 hours.   Patient is getting
   evaluated for possible second transplant.   Given fluid overload,
   patient may require initiation of dialysis.  Falling bicarb and rising
   creatinine also due to worsening renal failure and worsening
   hyperkalemia.  Will likely need CVVH.
   - renal consult for posssible initiation of dialysis
   - follow urine output
   - continue epo, zemplar
   - continue sirolimus
   - hold tacrolimus per renal
   - check sirolums level
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   - minimize inputs given low UOP
   - start calcium acetate, nephrocaps
   .
   5.  Type 1 DM.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].  Had episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight.
   - repeat Echo to further elucidate etiology of respiratory failure
   (?chf)
   - ROMI
   - daily EKGs
   .
   7.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3 on
   [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.
   - continue epo
   - PRBC transfusion today
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD secondary to a failed renal transplant, admitted with respiratory failure. The etiology of respiratory failure is unclear but may include aspiration pneumonitis, flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, or pneumonia. The patient has shown rapid improvement in ventilation settings and has negative sputum gram stain. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated. There are concerns about CHF and an infectious process. 

The patient also has hypotension, hypertension at baseline, and increasing sedation and fever, which could be due to medication effect or septic shock. Levophed drip has been started to maintain MAPs > 60.

The patient has ESRD post renal transplant and is being evaluated for a possible second transplant. There is fluid overload, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia, indicating the need for dialysis. CVVH may be required.

The patient also has Type 1 DM and requires insulin drip to maintain fasting blood sugar between 80 and 120. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 20% is present. Anemia is also present with fluctuating hematocrit levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis, flash pulmonary edema, ARDS, or pneumonia.
2. Hypotension due to ESRD and hypertension at baseline.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella.  Her issue at present is that she is markedly volume
   overloaded
   - Stopped Vanco. Will stop pip-tazo [**12-2**], will treat for 10 day course
   of levaquin.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, but now vol overloaded
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis but conts to require transfusion. Will recheck
   hemolysis labs again as well as Fe, B12 and folate as well as retic
   count and
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC, recheck Hct, goal >25
   - anemia work up
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: remains hypernatremic but volume overloaded
   (interdependent factors ), she will need to cont to get free water and
   also IV diuresis
   - q 6 hr lyte checks
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with acute respiratory failure. She has a history of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and is suspected to have either congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics but has negative BAL and viral panel results. She is also volume overloaded and requires dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which could be due to CHF, pneumonia, or a combination of both. There is a need to monitor her respiratory status closely and ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Volume Overload: The patient is markedly volume overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function. Monitoring fluid balance and implementing appropriate diuretic therapy will be crucial in managing this condition.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Further investigation is required to determine the cause of the anemia, including checking for hemolysis, iron, vitamin B12, folate levels, reticulocyte count, and stool occult blood.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient remains hypernatremic and requires careful management of free water and electrolyte balance.

5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): With the patient's current hyper"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella. Would fav
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)pending final results on clx
   data. Will d/c vancomycin today and plan for further titration of abx
   based on clx data.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, requiring [**10-11**]. Additional barrier includes
   altered MS (improving with hold on sedation)
   >  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, became
   hypotensive in the setting of labetalol raising concern for infectious
   vs caridogenic  and possibly compounded by falling Hct. Finally
   sedation is likely contributing to the hypotension.  TTE showing
   biventricular failure with worsened right sided function. Holding beta
   blocker and other empiric therapy for now.
   - Stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone usage, will
 dose
   today.
   - holding cardiac meds
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis
    >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: increase free water via tube feeds.
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) versus pneumonia. She also has a history of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to immunocompromise but has negative results for both BAL and viral panel. Her respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including renal failure with volume overload, aspiration event, and an inflammatory lung condition. There is a positive culture for Moraxella.

The patient has hypotension, which may be due to ESRD, hypertension at baseline, and altered mental status. She has biventricular failure with worsened right-sided function as seen on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Beta blockers and other cardiac medications are being held.

The patient also has anemia that did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She requires additional transfusion today, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. Guaiac stool test should be done to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.

She has hypernatremia and requires increased free water via tube feeds. The patient's Type 1 diabetes mellitus is poorly controlled, with hyperglycemia and an elevated anion gap. She is at risk for the development of diabetic ketoacid"

   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella. Would fav
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin for pneumonia (vanco requires dosing by level
   due to impaired renal function, oliguria)pending final results on clx
   data. Will d/c vancomycin today and plan for further titration of abx
   based on clx data.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, requiring [**10-11**]. Additional barrier includes
   altered MS (improving with hold on sedation)
   >  Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema, became
   hypotensive in the setting of labetalol raising concern for infectious
   vs caridogenic  and possibly compounded by falling Hct. Finally
   sedation is likely contributing to the hypotension.  TTE showing
   biventricular failure with worsened right sided function. Holding beta
   blocker and other empiric therapy for now.
   - Stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone usage, will
 dose
   today.
   - holding cardiac meds
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis
    >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: increase free water via tube feeds.
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD, and a history of failed renal transplant. She was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, hypernatremia, and potential development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure likely due to multifactorial causes such as renal failure with volume overload, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and aspiration event in an immunocompromised host. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and consider weaning from mechanical ventilation once stable.

2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which could be attributed to several factors including ESRD, hypertension at baseline, flash pulmonary edema, sedation, and potential infectious or cardiogenic causes. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting medications accordingly is essential.

3. Anemia: The patient did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), indicating possible dilutional anemia. Further evaluation, including guaiac stool test and additional transfusion, is necessary to determine the underlying cause.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which should be managed by increasing free water via"

2. Hypotension: The patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline. Hypotension may be due to flash pulmonary edema, infectious vs cardiogenic causes, falling hematocrit, or sedation.

3. Anemia: The patient did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). It could be dilutional anemia, and further investigation is needed, including stool occult blood test, reticulocyte count, and assessment of iron, B12, and folate levels.

4. ESRD: The patient underwent renal transplant in 2015 but developed rising creatinine levels over the past several months. She now has a creatinine level of 5.5, indicating the need for hemodialysis (HD) prior to extubation to manage volume control and electrolyte balance.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella.  Her issue at present is that she is markedly volume
   overloaded
   - Stopped Vanco. Will stop pip-tazo [**12-2**], will treat for 10 day course
   of levaquin.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, but now vol overloaded
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis but conts to require transfusion. Will recheck
   hemolysis labs again as well as Fe, B12 and folate as well as retic
   count and
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC, recheck Hct, goal >25
   - anemia work up
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: remains hypernatremic but volume overloaded
   (interdependent factors ), she will need to cont to get free water and
   also IV diuresis
   - q 6 hr lyte checks
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant in 2015, admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) versus pneumonia, possibly aspiration. She also has progressive renal failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and concerns about volume overload. There is a possibility of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.

2. Anemia: The patient's anemia has not responded to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). She continues to require transfusion, and there is a possibility of dilutional anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of unresponsiveness to PRBC transfusion.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient remains hypernatremic due to interdependent factors, including volume overload. She requires continued management with free water administration and intravenous diuresis to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient is at risk for the development of DKA due to hyperglycemia and an elevated anion gap. Close monitoring of fingerstick glucose levels and appropriate insulin therapy are necessary to prevent DKA.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, EF 20%, ESRD post failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure. She has a history of aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid-responsive pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has evidence of volume overload with pleural effusions. Renal function is impaired, and there are plans for dialysis. The patient also has hypotension, ESRD s/p renal transplant, Type 1 DM, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, anemia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis or steroid-responsive pneumonia.
2. Pleural effusions secondary to volume overload.
3. Hypotension, which may be due to medication effects or septic shock.
4. Graft failure in ESRD s/p renal transplant.
5. Fluctuating Hct in anemia management.
6. Hypernatremia requiring free water boluses and D5W administration.
7. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF < 20.
8. Wide complex tachycardia and mildly elevated troponin and CK levels.
9. Poor response to blood transfusion.
10. Potential complications related to the use of immunosuppressive medications such as Sirolimus and Tacrolimus."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed
   transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to ? aspiration
   pneumonitis versus steroid responsive pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Likely two processes occurring.  Initially
   with high vent support and rapid improvement over 24 hours suggesting a
   steroid responsive element (?pneumonitis).  However, now has fevers,
   infiltrate on CXR, and moraxella in sputum suggestive of pneumonia.
   Will cover with zosyn/levaquin.  Viral panel negative.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of CHF given low urine output.
   - CMV viral load
   - renal consult for eval of HD for fluid removal, rising Cr
   - f/u blood cultures, sputum
   - follow WBC, fever curve
   - wean sedation and then try for pressure support trial
   2.Hypotension.  Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline (on
   toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED, patient was
   hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema.  However,
   patient became hypotensive in setting of increasing sedation and fever,
   concerning for med effect versus septic shock.  Now off pressors for >
   24 hours in setting of lightening sedation.
   -monitor bp
   - taper stress dose steroids
   .
   3.  ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   7.2 and with some urine output.   Patient is getting evaluated for
   possible second transplant as outpatient.   Given fluid overload,
   patient may require initiation of dialysis.  Falling bicarb and rising
   creatinine also due to worsening renal failure.  Will likely need HD at
   some point, but not emergently.
   - renal following
   - follow urine output
   - continue epo (increase dose per renal)
   - d/c zemplar
   - continue sirolimus
   - hold tacrolimus per renal
   - check sirolums level
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, but can wean today
   - minimize inputs given low UOP
   - start calcium acetate, nephrocaps
   - trial of lasix today
   4.  Type 1 DM.
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks
   5.  Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].  Had episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight two
   nights ago.  Has mildly elevated troponin and CK.  Echo is unchanged.
   - daily EKGs
   6.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctating Hct.  Most recently 38.3
   prior to admissionon [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.  Poor response to
   blood transfusion yesterday, so will transfuse again.
   - increase epo dose per EPO
   - PRBC transfusion today
   7.Hypernatremia.
   - free water boluses through NGT
   - D5W
   - follow Na
   PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, VAP precautions
   FEN: tube feeds through NGT

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 6610] is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid-responsive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Ms. [Known Lastname 6610] is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to two processes occurring - aspiration pneumonitis and steroid-responsive pneumonia. She has fevers, infiltrate on CXR, and moraxella in sputum suggestive of pneumonia. She will be covered with Zosyn/Levaquin. Viral panel negative.
2. Hypotension: The patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at baseline. She became hypotensive in the setting of increasing sedation and fever, concerning for medication effect versus septic shock. Now off pressors for more than 24 hours in the setting of lightening sedation.
3. ESRD s/p renal transplant: The patient underwent renal transplant in [2152], but had rising Cr over the past several months. Now, her Cr is 7.2 with some urine output. She is getting evaluated for possible second transplant as an outpatient. Given fluid overload, she may require initiation of dialysis. Falling bicarb and rising creatinine also due to worsening renal failure. She will likely need HD at some point, but not emergently.
4. Type 1 DM: The patient requires insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120.
5. Nonishcemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has an EF < 20 on most recent echo in [4-14]. She had an episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight two nights ago. She has mildly elevated troponin and CK. Echo is unchanged.
6. Anemia: The patient has widely fluctuating Hct. Most recently, it was 38.3 prior to admission on [7-14]. MCV 82 with elevated RDW. Poor response to blood transfusion yesterday, so she will be transfused again.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed with free water boluses through NGT and D5W.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving free water boluses to address hypernatremia, and their condition has improved. Renal failure is mentioned, but no immediate dialysis is planned, and the patient is being given Lasix and an increased dose of Epo.

The patient is also receiving stress dose steroids, which have been tapered down to 50 mg every 12 hours. They are experiencing increasing tachypnea and gagging on the tube but are still following simple commands. As a result, they have been given IV boluses of Versed for sedation.

The patient has allergies to Percocet and a rash. Antibiotics such as Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Levofloxacin, and Piperacillin have been administered at different times.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate between 89-108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/74 to 165/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission at 52.1 kg.

Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 34 mmHg, with total input and output balances within normal limits. Fluid balance is also within normal limits.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory"

   2. Hypotension.  Resolved. Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at
   baseline (on toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED,
   patient was hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema.
   However, patient became hypotensive in setting of increasing sedation
   and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic shock.  Now off
   pressors for > 48 hours in setting of lightening sedation and pressure
   have resolved..

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, EF 20%, ESRD s/p
   failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to ?
   aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid responsive pneumonia.
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Initially infiltrate, high vent support
   responding to steroids. Now infiltrate, fevers, moraxella. [**12-1**]
   started Zosyn/Levo.  CMV VL negative. Today [**12-2**] evidence of volume
   overload w/ pleural effusions.
   Moraxella, Levofloxacin for 10 day course to end [**12-7**]
   Trend WBC, fevers
   Sedation with propofol starting [**12-2**]
   Failed [**Last Name (LF) 3406**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] retry later today
   Diuresis goal negative 1-2L today
   2. Hypotension.  Resolved. Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at
   baseline (on toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED,
   patient was hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema.
   However, patient became hypotensive in setting of increasing sedation
   and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic shock.  Now off
   pressors for > 48 hours in setting of lightening sedation and pressure
   have resolved..
   Monitor BP
   Taper stress dose steroids to 12.5 mg q12hr
   3.  ESRD s/p renal transplant [**2152**]. Evidence graft slowly failing over
   past several months. Patient under consideration 2^nd transplant. Off
   Zemplar currently.
   Appreciate Renal Recs, no plans for HD today given patient response to
   lasix
   UOP good with lasix, cont using lasix for goal neg 1-2 L [**2161-12-2**]
   Continue EPO
   Continue Sirolimus, HOLDING Tacrolimus per renal
   Calcium acetate, nephrocaps
   Check Sirolimus level
 [**12-4**]
   4.  Type 1 DM.
   Insulin drip to maintain FS between 150-200
   Follow fingersticks
   5.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].  Had episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight two
   nights ago.  Has mildly elevated troponin and CK.  Echo is unchanged.
   Daily EKGs
   6.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctuating Hct.  Most recently 38.3
   prior to admission [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.  Poor response to
   blood transfusion yesterday, so will transfuse again.
   On Increased EPO dose per renal
   Transfuse to goal HCT >25
   7. Hypernatremia: resolved
   Free water boluses through NGT, decreased as sodium normalized
   Follow Na

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hyperglycemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient received dialysis and was given 1.5 liters of fluid removal. He was also administered 160 mEq of potassium chloride due to ongoing diuresis. The patient tolerated 80 mg IV lasix well and had free water flushes decreased to 200ml every 6 hours. Propofol was started for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Given the patient's current condition and ongoing diuresis, there is a risk of hypotension due to fluid removal and medication administration.
2. Hyperkalemia: With the administration of potassium chloride, there is a potential for hyperkalemia if the levels become elevated.
3. Respiratory distress: As the patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay, there is a possibility of developing infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pneumonia.
5. Fluid overload: Despite the fluid removal during dialysis, the patient may still be at risk for fluid overload if not properly managed.
6. Renal function deterioration: The patient already has ESRD, and further deterioration of renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms.  [**Known lastname 6610**] is a 52 year old female with Type 1 DM, EF 20%, ESRD s/p
   failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to ?
   aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid responsive pneumonia.
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Initially infiltrate, high vent support
   responding to steroids. Now infiltrate, fevers, moraxella. [**12-1**]
   started Zosyn/Levo.  CMV VL negative. Today [**12-2**] evidence of volume
   overload w/ pleural effusions.
   Moraxella, Levofloxacin for 10 day course to end [**12-7**]
   Trend WBC, fevers
   Sedation with propofol starting [**12-2**]
   Failed [**Last Name (LF) 3406**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] retry later today
   Diuresis goal negative 1-2L today
   2. Hypotension.  Resolved. Patient has ESRD and is hypertensive at
   baseline (on toprol 200 mg and nifedipine 90 daily at home).  In ED,
   patient was hypertensive and given concern for flash pulmonary edema.
   However, patient became hypotensive in setting of increasing sedation
   and fever, concerning for med effect versus septic shock.  Now off
   pressors for > 48 hours in setting of lightening sedation and pressure
   have resolved..
   Monitor BP
   Taper stress dose steroids to 12.5 mg q12hr
   3.  ESRD s/p renal transplant [**2152**]. Evidence graft slowly failing over
   past several months. Patient under consideration 2^nd transplant. Off
   Zemplar currently.
   Appreciate Renal Recs, no plans for HD today given patient response to
   lasix
   UOP good with lasix, cont using lasix for goal neg 1-2 L [**2161-12-2**]
   Continue EPO
   Continue Sirolimus, HOLDING Tacrolimus per renal
   Calcium acetate, nephrocaps
   Check Sirolimus level
 [**12-4**]
   4.  Type 1 DM.
   Insulin drip to maintain FS between 150-200
   Follow fingersticks
   5.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient with EF < 20 on most recent
   echo in [**4-14**].  Had episode of wide complex tachycardia overnight two
   nights ago.  Has mildly elevated troponin and CK.  Echo is unchanged.
   Daily EKGs
   6.  Anemia.  Patient has widely fluctuating Hct.  Most recently 38.3
   prior to admission [**7-14**].  MCV 82 with elevated RDW.  Poor response to
   blood transfusion yesterday, so will transfuse again.
   On Increased EPO dose per renal
   Transfuse to goal HCT >25
   7. Hypernatremia: resolved
   Free water boluses through NGT, decreased as sodium normalized

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, EF 20%, ESRD s/p failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid-responsive pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, ESRD s/p renal transplant, Type 1 DM, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, anemia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had an infiltrate and required high ventilator support. She responded to steroids but now has a new infiltrate and fever, indicating a possible bacterial infection. She is being treated with Zosyn/Levo and has a negative CMV VL.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved and is likely due to her ESRD and hypertension at baseline. She was given concern for flash pulmonary edema but later became hypotensive in the setting of increasing sedation and fever, possibly due to medication effect versus septic shock.

3. ESRD s/p renal transplant: The patient has evidence of graft slowly failing over the past several months. She is under consideration for a second transplant and is currently not on Zemplar.

4. Type 1 DM: The patient requires an insulin drip to maintain fasting blood sugar (FS) between 150-200. She also has fluctuating Hct levels and an elevated MCV with RD"

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 52.1 kg. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 29 cmH2O, total input of 4,986 mL, total output of 3,445 mL, urine output of 1,595 mL, and negative fluid balance of 1,541 mL.

The patient is on multiple medications including insulin, propofol, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, metoprolol, hydrocortisone, epoetin alfa, vit K, metoclopramide, calcium acetate, nephrocaps, sirolimus, albuterol, acetaminophen, pravastatin, docusate, senna, and bisacodyl.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 18.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, sodium of 144 mg/dL, potassium of 6.0 mg/dL, chloride of 23 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 26.3%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 112 mg/dL, creatinine of 7.4 mg/dL, glucose of 258 mg/dL, and slightly elevated liver enzymes.

Assessment and plan include hypertension, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and respiratory failure. The patient is on nutrition support with Renal (Full) at 30 mL/hour and is being monitored for glycemic control. Arterial and central lines have been placed for monitoring and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits but needs to be monitored closely to prevent any complications associated with hypertension such as stroke or heart disease.
2. Renal Failure: As an ESRD patient, the patient is at risk for further deterioration of renal function. Complications may include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for continued dialysis.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia. If left uncontrolled, this can lead to diabetic complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation to support their breathing. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or volutrauma.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and indwelling lines, they are at an increased risk of developing infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella.  Her issue at present is that she is markedly volume
   overloaded
   - Stopped Vanco. Will stop pip-tazo [**12-2**], will treat for 10 day course
   of levaquin.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, but now vol overloaded
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis but conts to require transfusion. Will recheck
   hemolysis labs again as well as Fe, B12 and folate as well as retic
   count and
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC, recheck Hct, goal >25
   - anemia work up
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: remains hypernatremic but volume overloaded
   (interdependent factors ), she will need to cont to get free water and
   also IV diuresis
   - q 6 hr lyte checks
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD following a failed renal transplant, admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus pneumonia, in the setting of progressive renal failure. The patient is also experiencing anemia, hypernatremia, and is at risk for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which could be due to CHF or pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate respiratory support will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and a failed renal transplant. The rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, and the patient may require dialysis to manage volume overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia, and additional PRBCs may be required to maintain an adequate hematocrit level.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient remains hypernatremic, likely due to volume overload. Free water administration and IV diuresis may be necessary to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood glucose levels and bicarbonate indicate the risk of developing DKA. Close monitoring of fingersticks and"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. Would favor
   lightening sedation significantly and attempt at PS. Only positive clx
   is moraxella.  Her issue at present is that she is markedly volume
   overloaded
   - Stopped Vanco. Will stop pip-tazo [**12-2**], will treat for 10 day course
   of levaquin.
   - initiation of HD will discuss with renal.
   - PS trial at present, but now vol overloaded
   > Anemia: did not respond to a unit of PRBC. Will need to guiac stool.
   Could be dilutional Will transfuse an additional unit today. No
   evidence of  hemolysis but conts to require transfusion. Will recheck
   hemolysis labs again as well as Fe, B12 and folate as well as retic
   count and
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC, recheck Hct, goal >25
   - anemia work up
   >ESRD s/p renal transplant.  Patient underwent renal transplant in
   [**2152**], however had had rising Cr over past several months, now with Cr
   5.5 she will likely require initiation of HD prior to extubation to
   assist with volume control and electrolyte management although there is
   no acute indication it would seem likely that she will need HD soon.
   - discuss timing of HD with renal
   - follow urine output
   - stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use, decrease by
 today.
   > hypernatremia: remains hypernatremic but volume overloaded
   (interdependent factors ), she will need to cont to get free water and
   also IV diuresis
   - q 6 hr lyte checks
   >  Type 1 DM. Patient now with hyperglycemia and bicarb of 20, and
   anion gap of 16.  No urine ketones at present, but at risk for
   development of DKA.
   - reglan for ? of diabetic gastroparesis vs opiate effect
   - insulin drip to maintain FS between 80 and 120
   - follow fingersticks

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Type 1 DM, ESRD (end-stage renal disease) after a failed renal transplant in 2015, admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF (congestive heart failure) versus pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure. She is currently in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and requires multiple interventions to manage her conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 141/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV (continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC (white blood cell count), Hct (hematocrit), and creatinine, as well as electrolyte imbalances including hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Her liver function tests are abnormal with elevated ALT/AST and alkaline phosphatase levels. Other lab abnormalities include elevated troponin T, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia. She also had progressive renal failure. The patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated and placed on room air.

The patient underwent renal transplantation in 2015 but had rising creatinine levels over the past several months, with a current creatinine level of 5.5. She had one episode of hemodialysis (HD) but showed good urine output to 80 with intravenous lasix. It is planned to remove the dialysis catheter and assess if further HD is needed based on urine output.

The patient's anemia did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and guaiac stool test should be done to check for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient continues to require transfusion, and hematocrit (Hct) is now stable.

The patient has hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 258 mg/dL and bicarbonate of 20, with an anion gap of 16. She is at risk for development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Insulin gtt has been discontinued, but Lantus/SSI should be continued, and fingersticks should be followed.

   52 year old female with Type 1 DM, ESRD s/p failed transplant ([**2152**]),
   admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to CHF versus
   pneumonia (?aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure.
   >Respiratory failure.  Likely multifactorial: ? renal failure with
   volume overloaded  with hx of depressed EF of 15% (BNP 20,000),
   aspiration event in an immunocomprimised host (on broad coverage) with
   neg BAL eval and neg viral panel.  Its possible that this is also an
   inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution.  Dialysis
   initiated yesterday to help with volume status. Extubated this am

   5.5.  s/p one episode of HD, but also with good UOP to 80 IV lasix.
   -          Renal to d/c dialysis cath
   -          If UOP continues to be okay, then no further need for HD. If
   not, will attempt to get tunneled HD cath by IR tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration in the setting of progressive renal failure. She is currently extubated and on room air. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 141/74 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15% and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 20,000.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia that did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level. Her renal function is compromised, as indicated by a creatinine (Cr) level of 5.5. She underwent a renal transplant in 2015 but had rising Cr levels over the past few months. She has received one session of hemodialysis (HD) and has good urine output (UOP) to 80 with intravenous (IV) lasix. The plan is to discontinue dialysis catheter and attempt to get a tunneled HD catheter by interventional radiology (IR) tomorrow."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-failed transplant, admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) versus pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of progressive renal failure. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including renal failure with volume overload, aspiration event in an immunocompromised host, and negative BAL and viral panel evaluations. Dialysis was initiated yesterday to help with volume status, and the patient was extubated yesterday and now on RA (removal assistance). She is on levaquin to cover Moraxella in sputum per ID.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a combination of factors, including renal failure with volume overload, aspiration event in an immunocompromised host, and possible inflammatory lung condition. Dialysis has been initiated to assist with volume status.
2. Anemia: The patient did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfused on [11-30]. Her hematocrit (Hct) is stable, likely due to negative fluid balance. There is no evidence of hemolysis.
3. ESRD s/p renal transplant: The patient underwent renal transplant in [2152], but had rising creatinine levels over the past several months. Her current creatinine level is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of a failed renal transplant. She was admitted with respiratory failure, which may have been secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia (possibly aspiration pneumonia). The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including volume overload due to renal failure and an aspiration event in an immunocompromised host. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the BAL evaluation and viral panel were negative. It is possible that the patient also had an inflammatory lung condition, given the rapid resolution. 

The patient underwent dialysis yesterday to help with her volume status and was extubated yesterday, now on room air. She is currently on levaquin to cover Moraxella in her sputum, as per the Infectious Disease (ID) recommendation.

The patient also has anemia that did not respond to a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC), and her hemoglobin concentration is stable. There is no evidence of hemolysis.

Regarding her ESRD and previous renal transplant, the patient underwent renal transplant in [**2152**], but had rising creatinine levels over the past several months, now with a creatinine level of 5.5. She had one episode of hemodialysis (HD) and is autodiuresing well. There is no acute indication"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 6610] is a 52-year-old female with Type 1 DM, EF 20%, ESRD s/p failed transplant, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonitis versus steroid-responsive pneumonia. She has a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, anemia, and hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but spent most of the day on room air. She required reintubation overnight due to respiratory distress. 

The patient has been diagnosed with Moraxella infection and is being treated with Levofloxacin for a 10-day course. She is also receiving insulin for her diabetes management and has been started on a PO diabetic diet. 

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, but currently stable. She has been weaned off pressors and her sedation has been lightened. 

The patient has chronic kidney disease and is under consideration for a second renal transplant. Her urea and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired renal function. 

She has anemia with a widely fluctuating Hct and poor response to blood transfusion. 

The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated but have been corrected with free water boluses. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which may be due to aspiration pneumonitis or steroid-responsive pneumonia. She required invasive ventilation but spent most of the day on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hyperglycemia. He is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been extubated for a period of time. The patient has received dialysis and is now on insulin and a diabetic diet. His vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/69 mmHg to 198/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination shows no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal systems. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood glucose, and some liver enzymes, while other values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial chief complaint and ongoing need for respiratory support indicate a potential risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings show significant fluctuations, indicating the need for close monitoring and management to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): As the patient has ESRD, there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased susceptibility to infections.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently elevated, requiring close monitoring and management to prevent complications related to high blood sugar, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
5. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESRD and the use of invasive lines and procedures, there is a risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT formation, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information. A thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and additional diagnostic tests would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."
