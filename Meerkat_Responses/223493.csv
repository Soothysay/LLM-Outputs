","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple complications including acute respiratory failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. The patient has been admitted to the medical ICU for respiratory distress and has been receiving aggressive diuretics, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antifungal treatment.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening pulmonary infiltrates may indicate the development of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and fluid balance is crucial.

2. Infection: The patient is immunocompromised and has been diagnosed with various infections such as HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), CMV viremia, and febrile neutropenia. Close observation for signs of infection and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

3. Renal Function: The patient has a history of ARF, and there are concerns about the impact of aggressive diuretic therapy on renal function. Regular monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of renally dosed medications are essential.

4. Hypertension/PAF/Tachycardia: The patient is hypertensive and tachycardic. It is important to closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust the antihypertensive medication as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has experienced multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, veno-occlusive disease, febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status has worsened over the past few days with evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging. He is immunocompromised and had an acute decompensation after bronchoscopy, which may have precipitated pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. Other possible diagnoses include non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal infection, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient responded well to diuretics and is now stable on a face tent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening respiratory status and evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities suggest a potential respiratory complication. The differential diagnosis includes non-bacterial pneumonias, fungal infection, PCP, HAP, and other respiratory infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT). He has experienced multiple complications, including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. The patient presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) in respiratory distress, with worsening respiratory status over the past few days. Imaging showed pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities. He also has hypertension, altered mental status, bladder pain possibly due to a foley catheter, and hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with evolving pulmonary infiltrates on imaging. Immunosuppression and non-bacterial pneumonias, such as fungal infection or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), should be considered. The patient has responded well to aggressive diuresis and is now oxygenating well on a face tent.

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant and has had multiple complications including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress. He has worsening respiratory status over the past few days with evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging. He is immunocompromised and acutely decompensated after bronchoscopy, which may have precipitated pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal infection, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's current treatment plan includes aggressive diuresis with Lasix, monitoring of pulmonary toilet, continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem for previously diagnosed HAP, continuation of azithromycin, and prophylaxis for PCP. He is also receiving voriconazole for suspected fungal infection.

Other ongoing assessments and plans include management of bladder pain possibly due to Foley catheter irritation, hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), altered mental status, CMV viremia, multiple myeloma, ARF, hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now admitted to the ICU with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He requires noninvasive ventilation (NIV) support. The patient has also developed unilateral pupilary dilation with a fixed pupil.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition is worsening, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Immediate intervention is necessary to improve oxygenation and prevent further lung damage.
2. CMV Viremia: The patient's tachycardia may be indicative of a viral infection, specifically cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. This condition requires prompt treatment with antiviral medication such as ganciclovir (GCV).
3. GVHD: Given the patient's history of BMT, there is a risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclosporine and methylprednisolone, may be required to manage this condition.
4. Unilateral Mydriasis: The unilateral pupilary dilation with a fixed pupil could be a sign of neurological impairment or pressure on the oculomotor nerve. Further evaluation by a neurologist and ophthalmologist is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Urinary Discomfort: The patient is experiencing discomfort related to his urinary system. A"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of chronic thrombocytopenia and multiple myeloma (cancer). He presented with hypoxia after undergoing an allogeneic stem cell transplantation approximately 60 days ago. The patient remains ill with generalized ground-glass opacities (GGOs) throughout his lungs, which have improved somewhat with diuretics but still require close monitoring.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 82 bpm (79-99 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 129/86 mmHg to 108/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (16-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL (9.8-13.0 K/uL), hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL (31.0-31.9 g/dL), platelet count of 46 (23-72) x 10^3/mm^3, and a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL (1.8-1.8 mg/dL).

The patient is currently on several medications including at"

The patient remains ill and continues to be monitored for hypoxia, with ongoing cultures and reassessment of oxygen requirements.

The patient also experienced bladder spasm, likely due to a malfunctioning Foley catheter. This has been addressed, and the patient is receiving oxybutinin.

There is a mention of mydriasis, which is improving and is not believed to be related to any primary neurological problem. Further evaluation and follow-up with neurology are planned.

The patient has hypertension and tachycardia, which are thought to be related to atrial fibrillation. He is being managed with metoprolol.

GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) is being treated with immunosuppressants. The patient's disposition will be discussed with the bone marrow transplant team, and there is a possibility of transferring him to the floor for further treatment.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition with lipids and glycemic control with regular insulin. He has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, a stress ulcer H2 blocker, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) and has experienced multiple complications including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. He is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, which is thought to be caused by evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging. The patient has shown improvement in the last 24 hours with aggressive diuresis and is now oxygenating well on a face tent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal infection, PCP, or PNA. Aggressive pulmonary toilet, continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, and weaning off oxygen as tolerated should be continued.
2. Urinary Retention: Despite having a Foley catheter in place, the patient is retaining urine. Urology consultation is recommended to evaluate and possibly replace the Foley catheter.
3. Bladder Spasms: The patient has chronic bladder spasms that have not responded to oxybutynin. Further assessment of the response to anticholinergics and follow-up on urology recommendations are advised.
4. Left Eye Dilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.  Bronch washing
   negative to date.   O2 requirement decreased to 3-4L NC.

   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Overnight management with metoprolol and dilt per overnight
   events above.  Patient remains of the dilt drip with a HR of < 100.
   -cont dilt gtt and wean as tolerated.  Will start PO dilt today.
   -ECG in am.
   #) Urinary retention:  Patient seems to be retaining as he has urine on
   bedside BS.  [**Month (only) 11**] be that clots are getting stuck in foley.
   - Per uro: obtain formal BS. If > 450 urine then will place larger
   foley with ability for CBI.
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.  Patient still having severe
   spasms, may have had a slight positive response to oxybutinin.
   -F/u urology recs
   -continue oxybutinin, valium and morphone IV for spasms.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia: currently weaning off dilt gtt.
   Will start PO dilt this am.
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who has undergone allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT). He presents with multiple complications, including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. The patient was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress and is currently on face tent with decreased oxygen requirements.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, which may be due to non-bacterial pneumonia such as fungal infection, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or bacterial pneumonia. He has responded well to diuresis and is now tolerating the face tent with decreased oxygen requirements.

2. Narrow complex tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, possibly due to a severe bladder spasm or missing a dose of metoprolol. The differential diagnosis includes atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). The patient has been managed with metoprolol and diltiazem, and his heart rate is now below 100.

3. Urinary retention: The patient is retaining urine"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging. This could be due to various causes such as bacterial pneumonia, fungal infection, or PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). The patient has responded well to diuretics and is now saturating well on a face tent. Bronch washings have been negative to date.

2. Narrow Complex Tachycardia: The patient has a narrow complex tachycardia, possibly atrial fibrillation or AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. The cause may be related to severe bladder spasm or missing a dose of metoprolol. Management includes metoprolol and diltiazem infusion, with plans to wean off the diltiazem as tolerated.

3. Urinary Retention: The patient is retaining urine with clots getting stuck in the Foley catheter. A formal bladder scan has been ordered, and if the volume is greater than 450 mL, a larger Foley catheter with the ability for clean intermittent catheterization (CBI) will be placed.

4. Bladder Spasms: The patient is experiencing chronic bladder spasms, which have not responded well to oxybutynin. Oxybutynin and valium are being continued, along with morphine"

   shown instability as last evening he developed Afib/flutter.  This AM
   he remains in Afib but with a controlled rate due to IV dilt drip.   We
   are concerned that his bladder spasms which are painful, may have
   contributed to his arrhythmia.  Urology is following closing and are
   awaiting results of a bladder scan we
ve ordered.  Meanwhile we will

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT). He has been experiencing multiple complications, including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. 

The patient was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory distress, and he is currently on face tent with improved oxygenation. He has responded well to diuretics and is now able to tolerate lower levels of oxygen. The pulmonary toilet is being aggressively pursued, and cultures from bronchial lavage and blood have been obtained. 

The patient also presents with narrow complex tachycardia, which appears to be related to a severe bladder spasm. The differential diagnosis includes atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Overnight management with metoprolol and diltiazem has been initiated, and the patient remains on a diltiazem drip with a heart rate below 100 beats per minute. 

Urinary retention has been noted, with urine present on the bedside bladder scan. The Foley catheter may be obstructed, leading to urine clots. U"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) and has experienced multiple complications including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. The patient was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current conditions include evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, hypertensive episode after bronchoscopies, hypotension, urinary retention, bladder spasms, left eye dilation, hypertension/pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)/tachycardia, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/immunosuppression, altered mental status, CMV viremia, multiple myeloma, ARF, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and history of GIB.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging in an immunocompromised patient. Acute decompensation and pulmonary edema may have been precipitated by bronchoscopy in the setting of impaired renal function. Non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal infection, Pneumocystis"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function with question of
   fungal infection. Was diuresed initially with good response and
   stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -Holding off on diuresis for now as patient had had tenuous BP in
   setting of narrow complex tachycardia.
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -Continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -Completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving Cr, decreased to 1.7 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   - Appreciate renal recs: No indication for hemodialysis at this point
   - Appreciate Heme-Onc input
   - Check 24-hour urine creatinine
   - Guaiac stools to r/o GIB
   - DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   - Renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   - Has already completed tx for VOD

   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma as has been
   chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given past [**Last Name (un) 508**]
   - Check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been

   - Cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   - F/u abd US final read
   - F/u urology recs regarding whether further work-up w/ cystoscopy
   indicated, whether able to d/c Foley
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Initial management with metoprolol and dilt gtt, now weaned to
   dilt po without recurrence
   -Cont beta blocker and dilt
   #) Hypertension: Beta blocker and dilt.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have
   resolved. MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.
   - F/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -Hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma and subsequent complications, including acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, veno-occlusive disease, febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus viremia. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging. The patient has been diagnosed with ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia, CMV viremia, hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, bladder spasms, narrow complex tachycardia, hypertension, left eye dilation, GVHD/immunsuppression, altered mental status, and CMV viremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, which could be indicative of a fungal infection or other pulmonary complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, with a peak creatinine level of 6.2. The cause of ARF could be cyclosporine-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with possible components from VOD. There is concern regarding persistently elevated BUN, which may be related to steroid effect, TPN, or GI bleed.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function with question of
   fungal infection. Was diuresed initially with good response and
   stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -Holding off on diuresis for now as patient had had tenuous BP in
   setting of narrow complex tachycardia.
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -Continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -Completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving Cr, decreased to 1.7 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   - Appreciate renal recs: No indication for hemodialysis at this point
   - Appreciate Heme-Onc input
   - Check 24-hour urine creatinine
   - Guaiac stools to r/o GIB
   - DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   - Renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   - Has already completed tx for VOD
   #) Hyperkalemia: Requiring kayexalate. Ddx: supratherapeutic
   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN
   - D/c potassium in TPN
   - Change voriconazole to micafungin
   - W/u of renal failure as above
   - Monitor lytes
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma as has been
   chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given past [**Last Name (un) 508**]
   - Check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   - Cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   - F/u abd US final read
   - F/u urology recs regarding whether further work-up w/ cystoscopy
   indicated, whether able to d/c Foley
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Initial management with metoprolol and dilt gtt, now weaned to
   dilt po without recurrence
   -Cont beta blocker and dilt
   #) Hypertension: Beta blocker and dilt.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have
   resolved. MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.
   - F/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -Hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved
   #) H/o GIB
   -Guaiac stools as above; monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient, spoke with his wife and [**Name2 (NI) 5764**]
   coverage, Dr [**Name (NI) 1359**], and also spoke at length with the renal consulting
   team.  I was present for the key portion of the MICU services
   provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5765**]
s note above and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  Overall, from a resp standpoint, Mr [**Known lastname 5400**]
   has done well with resolving infiltrates and less dyspnea.  Cultures
   non revealing, but the plan is to continue [**Last Name (un) 1540**] and Vori.  While his
   presumed cyclosporin induced ATN has resolved with better U.O. and
   gradually lower creatinine, his BUN remains high, which renal feels is
   likely due to steroids and amino acids in TPN.  Elevated K has likely
   been due to less than normal renal function, K in TPN, and effect of
   cyclosporine in conjuction with vori.  Will consult with ID but will
   likely change vori to micafungin.  K has been taken out of TPN.
   Bladder spasms are considerably improved with ditropan, both pt and
   wife agree.  [**Name2 (NI) 5766**], his Afib has been rate controlled and just this AM
   he may be back in NSR.  45 min spent in the care of this critically ill
   and complex patient.

   distress in the setting of elevation in LVEDP as pulmonary edema is
   clearly seen on the CXR this morning.  In addition--he has had
   significant recurrence of his unilateral pupil dilation noted--this
   time on the right.  This is in the setting of oxybutinin Rx and
   Atrovent given at 3am today.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has worsening pulmonary infiltrates, LOS
   positive 2 liters and has concerning elevation in CVP today at 14 with
   inspiratory fall but that is in the setting of significant respiratory
   distress.  In addition
patient with elevation of beta-glucan and
   concern in the immunocompromised state for possible fungal infection.
   -Antibiotics expanded to include Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/GCV and antifungal coverage
   (vori) to continue to be discussed with ID and in the setting of fever
   certainly infection requires treatment.  Fever emerged in the setting
   of Vanco/Azitrho discontinuing
   -Will move to negative fluid balance today to move to improve
   oxygenation and improved resp distress.
   -BIPAP to aid in patient tolerance
   2)Acute Renal Failure-He does have persistent elevation of BUN in the
   setting of TPN and steroid Rx which are essential.
   -U/O continued to be brisk and Lasix responsive
   -K+ out of TPN
   -Appreciate renal input
   -CSA dosing being adjusted in concert with BMT team advice.
   -No evidence of significant [**Doctor First Name 5779**] on peripheral smear
   -No evidence of bladder dysfunction based upon detailed study with only
   mild ascites seen.
   -Would really prefer to D/C oxybutinin in the setting of altered neuro
   exam
   3)Altered Mental Status-This is manifest as significant pupillary
   changes.  His EOM are in tact this morning.  This is in the absence of
   change in exam otherwise.
   -Will pursue head CT if able to maintain safe resp status
   -Will continue to atrovent and maintain adequate delivery
   4)Atrial Fibrillation
   -Dilt increased
   -This am is sinus tachycardia and will treat pain, resp distress
   adequately this morning
   5)BMT/GVHD-
   -continue CSA and Steroids
   -Will adjust per BMT input and levels

   Assessment and Plan
   A 66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with
   multiple subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile
   neutropenia, CMV viremia now transferred to the MICU in respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary patchy infiltrates/ground
   glass opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Presumed fungal
   infection causing initial respiratory distress.  Was diuresed initially
   with good response and stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -continue vancomycin (re-started on [**4-16**] for persistent fevers)
   -completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -f/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**]
   #) Fever: Unclear et. Patient spiked again overnight.  Had stopped Vanc
   and Azithro a few days ago.  Also concern for drug fever but must first
   rule out infectious source.  Consider abdominal infection versus drug
   fever in ddx.
   -blood and urine cultures pending
   -tylenol for fever
   -consider abdominal CT
   -consider paracentesis
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving, decreased to 1.5 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   -appreciate renal recs: no indication for hemodialysis at this point
   -appreciate heme-onc input.  Will continue to watch for TTP-HUS and
   closely follow peripheral smear.  T/c coombs testing.
   -follow-up 24-hour urine creatinine
   -DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   -renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   -has already completed tx for VOD
   #) Hyperkalemia: Required kayexalate 30mg once. Ddx: supratherapeutic
   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN. Potassium has come down since switching voriconazole,
   decreasing cyclosporine and decreasing potassium in tube feeds.
   -changed voriconazole to micafungin
   -monitor lytes will replete K prn
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma and marrow
   suppressive therapy as has been chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given
   past [**Last Name (un) 508**].
   -check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   -cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   -f/u urology recs
   -remove foley catheter today
   #) Tachycardia: Initially narrow complex likely A-fib/flutter.
   Required rate control with dilt gtt.  Now on oral dilt and in sinus
   tach.  Reasons for sinus tach include pain, fever and respiratory
   distress.  Treatment for each per specific problem.  [**Name (NI) **] monitor for
   recurrence of fib/flutter.
   -cont diltiazem
   #) Hypertension: dilt., pain control.
   #) Anisocoria: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have resolved.
   MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.  Right eye dilated today,
   EOMI.
   -f/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression: Had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function. Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1Unit platelets this morning
   -transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved
   #) H/o GIB
   -monitor hct
   -transfuse per parameters above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple myeloma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) and has experienced multiple complications including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory distress, fever, ARF, hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, bladder spasms, tachycardia, hypertension, anisocoria, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/immunsuppression, altered mental status, CMV viremia, and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is presumed to be caused by a fungal infection, given the imaging findings of patchy infiltrates/ground glass opacities. The patient is already receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet, meropenem, micafungin, and vancomycin. BAL and follow-up bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures are pending.

   neutropenia, CMV viremia now transferred to the MICU in respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary patchy infiltrates/ground
   glass opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Presumed fungal
   infection causing initial respiratory distress.  Was diuresed initially
   with good response and stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.

   #) Fever: Unclear et. Patient spiked again overnight.  Had stopped Vanc
   and Azithro a few days ago.  Also concern for drug fever but must first
   rule out infectious source.  Consider abdominal infection versus drug
   fever in ddx.
   -blood and urine cultures pending
   -tylenol for fever
   -consider abdominal CT
   -consider paracentesis
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving, decreased to 1.5 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   -appreciate renal recs: no indication for hemodialysis at this point
   -appreciate heme-onc input.  Will continue to watch for TTP-HUS and
   closely follow peripheral smear.  T/c coombs testing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT). He has experienced multiple complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. The patient is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has evolved pulmonary patchy infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging, which are consistent with a presumed fungal infection. This is a potential complication of immunosuppression in the post-SCT setting. The patient is already receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet, continuing meropenem, and antifungal coverage with micafungin.
2. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers, and it is unclear whether they are due to an infectious source or drug fever. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and consideration is being given to abdominal CT and paracentesis.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient had a peak creatinine level of 6.2, which was thought to be cyclosporine-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with possible component from V"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient requires ongoing support for hypoxemia and intermittent tachycardia/paroxysms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient also has a persistent fever but with a mildly decreased white blood cell (WBC) count.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates are improving, and there is a negative fluid balance. This has been presumed as pneumonitis in the post-BMT state, with no infectious organisms seen. BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) is negative, and a 21-day course of meropenem has been prescribed. The patient will continue with anti-fungal treatment, which will be discussed with the infectious disease (ID) and BMT teams. Atovaquone for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has also been initiated.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels have improved in the setting of spontaneous negative fluid balance, suggesting an improving or resolving phase of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The plan is to maintain a negative fluid balance as long as Cr continues to improve.
