   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo female with h/o depression admitted to OSH with suidical ideation
   and worsening depression also with complaints of abdominal pain, N/V
   found to have acute liver injury, s/p intubation for worsening
   somnolence transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care of her transaminitis
   #  Acute Liver Injury: Certainly toxic ingestion (acetaminophen) can
   present this way, and the low level detected at the OSH may have been
   due to the fact that she had ingested many hours previously and had
   started to clear her levels.  Other possibilites include acute viral
   hepatitis (hep A) or hep B (less likely).  Also, possibly secondary to
   recent doxycycline use (rare). Also possibilites include portal vein
   thrombosis.  no evidence of biliary dilation on CT or US from OSH.
   Less likely causes include hemochromatosis, though ferritin is markedly
   elevated.
   - trend LFTs and coags- coags now peaked and heading downwards again
   - complete NAC infusion
   - f/u hepatitis A and B serologies
   - consider repeat abdominal US to eval for portal vein thrombosis
   - f/u transplant surgery eval
   - f/u OSH ceruloplasmin
   # Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: improving this AM; following
   commands.  Intubated for somnolence but appears to be doing better
   today and likely can be extubated
   - stop sedation; attempt extubation
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: as above; will attempt extubation
   today
   # Coagulopathy: markedly elevated INR, PTT, with thrombocytopenia.
   Likely etiology is acute liver injury. Thrombocytopenia may be
   secondary to chronic liver disease, though not documented previously.
   Also, DIC can cause similar picture as well.
   - trend coags- now improving likely as her [**Doctor Last Name 76**] improves
   - avoid FFP unless actively bleeding
   - no e/o of DIC on labs
   - infectious workup pending
   # Acute Kidney Injury: creat initially 2.1, down to 1.1 this AM, but
   now 1.8.  Possible etiologies include prerenal in the setting of toxic
   ingestions.  Also, possible acetaminophen toxicity.  HRS is also
   possible given her acute liver injury.
   - check prot/creat ratio
   - consider  fluid challenge or albumin challenge
   - if rapidly worsening, consider renal consult
   - no current indication for HD
   # Metabolic acidosis with concomitant respiratory acidosis: improved in
   the setting of ventilation, now improving metabolic acidosis as well.
   No e/o osmolar gap
   - monitor Q6H lytes
   # Depression: on seroquel as outpatient.  Will hold off for now
   - SW consult to help with family coping

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of depression admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation and worsening depression. She presented with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was found to have acute liver injury and subsequently intubated for worsening somnolence. She was transferred to another hospital for further care due to transaminitis.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Acute Liver Injury: Possible causes include toxic ingestion (acetaminophen), acute viral hepatitis (hep A or B), or portal vein thrombosis. Less likely causes include hemochromatosis, although ferritin is markedly elevated. The patient's liver function tests and coagulation parameters should be monitored, and complete NAC infusion should be given. Hepatitis A and B serologies should be followed up, and a repeat abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis should be considered. A follow-up with transplant surgery evaluation is also recommended.

2. Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: The patient's mental status is improving, and she is able to follow commands. Extubation may be attempted today.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This condition is being managed as previously mentioned. Extubation may be attempted today.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a markedly elevated INR, PTT, and thrombocytopenia. The likely etiology is acute liver injury, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo female with h/o depression admitted to OSH with suidical ideation
   and worsening depression also with complaints of abdominal pain, N/V
   found to have acute liver injury, s/p intubation for worsening
   somnolence transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care of her transaminitis
   #  Acute Liver Injury: Certainly toxic ingestion (acetaminophen) can
   present this way, and the low level detected at the OSH may have been
   due to the fact that she had ingested many hours previously and had
   started to clear her levels.  Other possibilites include acute viral
   hepatitis (hep A) or hep B (less likely).  Also, possibly secondary to
   recent doxycycline use (rare). Also possibilites include portal vein
   thrombosis.  no evidence of biliary dilation on CT or US from OSH.
   Less likely causes include hemochromatosis, though ferritin is markedly
   elevated.
   - trend LFTs and coags- coags now peaked and heading downwards again
   - complete NAC infusion
   - f/u hepatitis A and B serologies
   - consider repeat abdominal US to eval for portal vein thrombosis
   - f/u transplant surgery eval
   - f/u liver reccs
   - f/u OSH ceruloplasmin
   # Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: improving this AM; following
   commands.  Intubated for somnolence but appears to be doing better
   today and likely can be extubated
   - stop sedation; attempt extubation
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: as above; will attempt extubation
   today
   # Coagulopathy: markedly elevated INR, PTT, with thrombocytopenia.
   Likely etiology is acute liver injury. Thrombocytopenia may be
   secondary to chronic liver disease, though not documented previously.
   Also, DIC can cause similar picture as well.
   - trend coags- now improving likely as her [**Doctor Last Name 76**] improves
   - avoid FFP unless actively bleeding
   - no e/o of DIC on labs
   - infectious workup pending
   # Acute Kidney Injury: creat initially 2.1, down to 1.1 this AM, but
   now 1.8.  Possible etiologies include prerenal in the setting of toxic
   ingestions.  Also, possible acetaminophen toxicity.  HRS is also
   possible given her acute liver injury.
   - f/u UA and urine culture
   - check urine lytes
   - check prot/creat ratio
   - consider  fluid challenge or albumin challenge
   - if rapidly worsening, consider renal consult
   - no current indication for HD
   # Metabolic acidosis with concomitant respiratory acidosis: improved in
   the setting of ventilation, now improving metabolic acidosis as well.
   No e/o osmolar gap
   - monitor Q6H lytes
   # Depression: on seroquel as outpatient.  Will hold off for now
   - SW consult to help with family coping

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 40-year-old female admitted to the ICU with suicidal ideation, worsening depression, abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting. She was found to have acute liver injury and was intubated for worsening somnolence. She was transferred to Hospital1 for further care of her transaminitis.

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute Liver Injury: The patient's presentation is consistent with toxic ingestion of acetaminophen, which can present with acute liver injury. Other possibilities include acute viral hepatitis (hep A) or hep B, or portal vein thrombosis. Trend LFTs and coags, complete NAC infusion, follow-up hepatitis A and B serologies, consider repeat abdominal US to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis, follow-up transplant surgery evaluation, liver rechecks, and follow-up OSH ceruloplasmin.

2. Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: The patient's mental status is improving this morning, and she is able to follow commands. She was intubated for somnolence but appears to be doing better today and likely can be extubated. Stop sedation and attempt extubation.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure as mentioned earlier. Will attempt extubation today.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a markedly elevated INR, PTT, with thrombocytopenia. The likely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of depression who was admitted to the hospital with auditory hallucinations and suicidal thoughts.
- She was found to have fulminant hepatic failure of unclear etiology, with CT head/abd pelvis showing only fatty infiltration of the liver and RUQ US without biliary dilation.
- The patient was intubated for worsening mental status, and Tylenol level was measured at 6.7. She was placed on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) empirically.
- The patient is currently alert and following simple commands, with pupils dilated. Her vital signs are stable, and she is on pressure support ventilation with FiO2 at 50%.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure, possible acute kidney injury, and encephalopathy. She also has a history of depression.
- The plan includes continuing NAC infusion, performing a RUQ US to rule out portal vein thrombosis, monitoring liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lactate every 4 hours, and considering the need for an arterial line.
- A transplant evaluation has been initiated, and the patient may require a HIV consult, psychiatry consult, and transplant social work consult.
- The patient's mental status has improved significantly, and a plan for extubation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of depression who was admitted to the hospital with auditory hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. She was found to have fulminant hepatic failure of unclear etiology. Initial Tylenol level was 6.7, and she was placed on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) empirically. The patient is currently intubated due to worsening mental status. Propofol was discontinued overnight, and she is now following simple commands. FiO2 was weaned to 0.5, and she was switched to pressure support 10/5/0.5 this morning. A RUQ ultrasound is in progress. 

The patient has allergies to codeine, penicillins, and an unknown antibiotic. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [**2105-2-16**]. She is currently receiving NAC, famotidine (Pepcid), fentanyl, and colace.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/51 mmHg to 163/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume"

   40 yo female with h/o depression admitted to OSH with suidical ideation
   and worsening depression also with complaints of abdominal pain, N/V
   found to have acute liver injury, s/p intubation for worsening
   somnolence transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care of her transaminitis
   #  Acute Liver Injury: most likely acetaminophen toxicity, but still
   not entirely clear. Viral hepatitis serologies still pending.  Overall,
   liver function seems to be improving.  Abdominal US with normal flow,
   no e/o thrombosis.
   - cont to trend labs; INR is moving downwards and improvement in LFTs
   is encouraging
   - will cont NAC infusion until INR <1.5
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - f/u transplant surgery eval- likely may not need a liver transplant
   at this time; will cont to monitor
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u CMV/EBV serologies
   # Acute Kidney Injury: creat continues to rise; now up to 2.9.  Most
   likely etiology is ATN vs HRS.  Fluid challenge did not improve renal
   function.  FENA of 0.3 makes ATN most likely; and urine Na 21 makes HRS
   slightly less likely.  Other possibilites include acetaminophen
   toxicity.
   - urine cx NGTD
   - prot/creat is 1.3
   - consider renal consult
   - no current indication for HD
   # Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: continues to improve; extubated
   yesterday.  Following commands.
   - avoid neuroleptic medications
   # Coagulopathy: markedly elevated INR, PTT, with thrombocytopenia.
   Likely etiology is acute liver injury. Thrombocytopenia may be
   secondary to chronic liver disease, though not documented previously.
   Also, DIC can cause similar picture as well.
   - trend coags- now improving likely as her [**Doctor Last Name 76**] improves
   - avoid FFP unless actively bleeding
   - no e/o of DIC on labs
   - infectious workup pending
   # Metabolic acidosis: initially with concomitant respiratory acidosis
   but now improved.  Off mechanical ventilation.  Anion gap also
   improving.  Lactic acidosis most likely cause, and as lactate improved,
   acidosis has improved as well
   # Depression: on seroquel as outpatient.  Will hold off for now
   - SW consult to help with family coping

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of depression admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation and worsening depression. She presented with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was found to have acute liver injury, and her condition worsened, leading to intubation for somnolence. She was transferred to another hospital for further care of her transaminitis.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Acute Liver Injury: Most likely caused by acetaminophen toxicity, but viral hepatitis serologies are still pending. Liver function seems to be improving, and the abdominal ultrasound showed normal flow without evidence of thrombosis.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine continues to rise, indicating kidney dysfunction. The etiology is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). A fluid challenge did not improve renal function, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.3 makes ATN more likely. Other possibilities include acetaminophen toxicity.

3. Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: The patient's mental status is improving, and she has been extubated. She is following commands and should avoid neuroleptic medications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has markedly elevated INR, PTT, and thrombocytopenia. The likely etiology is acute liver injury."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of depression who was admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation and worsening depression. She also complained of abdominal pain and nausea, and was found to have acute liver injury. The patient was intubated for worsening somnolence and transferred to another hospital for further care.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Acute Liver Injury: Most likely due to acetaminophen toxicity, but viral hepatitis serologies are still pending. Liver function seems to be improving, as indicated by decreasing INR and improvement in liver function tests (LFTs). The plan is to continue N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion until INR is less than 1.5, follow up on hepatitis serologies, and consider liver transplant evaluation.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine level continues to rise, indicating impaired kidney function. The most likely etiology is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Fluid challenge did not improve renal function. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.3 suggests ATN as the likely cause. Other possibilities include acetaminophen toxicity. The plan is to obtain urine culture and check protein/creatinine ratio, consider renal consult, and avoid hemodialysis (HD) for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of depression admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for suicidal ideation and worsening depression. She presented with complaints of abdominal pain and nausea and was found to have acute liver injury. The patient underwent intubation for worsening somnolence and was transferred to another hospital for further care.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, and she is showing signs of improvement in her overall condition. However, she is still experiencing some complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), altered mental status/somnolence, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Liver Injury: The patient has evidence of acute liver injury, most likely due to acetaminophen toxicity. However, other causes such as viral hepatitis are still pending investigation. The liver function seems to be improving, but ongoing monitoring is required.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, indicating AKI. The etiology could be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). A fluid challenge did not improve renal function, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is suggestive of ATN rather than HRS. Other possibilities include acetaminophen toxicity.

   found to have acute liver injury, s/p intubation for worsening
   somnolence transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care of her transaminitis
   #  Acute Liver Injury: most likely acetaminophen toxicity, and given
   history provided by mother, this is the most likely cause.  Patient
   still denies acetaminophen OD. Viral hepatitis serologies all
   negative.  Overall, liver function continues to improve
   - Abdominal US with normal flow, no e/o thrombosis.
   - cont to trend labs; INR is moving downwards and improvement in LFTs
   is encouraging- t.bili continues to rise, but expected
   - will stop NAC infusion since INR is now <2
   - f/u transplant surgery eval- no need for transplant at this time
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u EBV serologies; CMV negative
   # Acute Kidney Injury: creat continues to rise; now 3.3.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN given muddy brown casts.
   - possibly ATN from hypotension vs acetaminophen?
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine cx- no growth

   - cont maintenance IVFs as she is taking in minimal POs
   # Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: continues to improve

   etiology is acute liver injury. Thrombocytopenia may be secondary to
   chronic liver disease, though not documented previously
   - trend coags- now improving
   - avoid FFP unless actively bleeding
   - infectious workup negative to date
   # Metabolic acidosis: initially with concomitant respiratory acidosis

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- Renal: The patient has muddy brown casts and decreased intravascular volume, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient received a 500cc bolus and maintenance fluids to address this.
- Psychological: The patient has a history of depression and suicidal ideation. The husband's misrepresentation of events and the patient's suicide note raise concerns about the accuracy of the information provided.
- Liver: The patient is being evaluated for acute liver injury, most likely due to acetaminophen toxicity. Viral hepatitis serologies are negative, and liver function tests are improving.
- Kidney: The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, indicating worsening kidney function. Muddy brown casts suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the likely etiology.
- Mental status: The patient's altered mental status is improving.
- Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated INR and PTT, likely due to acute liver injury. Thrombocytopenia may be secondary to chronic liver disease.
- Metabolic acidosis: Initially present with concomitant respiratory acidosis, but now improved. Lactic acidosis is the most likely cause, and as lactate improved, acidosis has also improved.
- Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, but medication will be held off for now.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of depression who was admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation and worsening depression. She also complained of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
2. The patient was found to have acute liver injury, most likely due to acetaminophen toxicity. However, viral hepatitis serologies are still pending. Her liver function seems to be improving, with a decreasing INR and improvement in liver enzymes.
3. The patient's kidney function is deteriorating, with a rising creatinine level up to 2.9. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) are the most likely causes. A fluid challenge did not improve renal function. Urine sodium levels suggest ATN as the cause.
4. The patient's altered mental status and somnolence are improving, and she has been extubated. She is now following commands. Neuroleptic medications should be avoided.
5. The patient has a coagulopathy with markedly elevated INR, PTT, and thrombocytopenia. This is likely due to acute liver injury. Trending coags shows improvement as her condition improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute liver injury
   -toxic ingestion presumed due to tylenol overdose
   -hepatology following
   -Transaminases & TBili trending downward
   -d/w liver service re: d/c NAC?
   -RUQ US ruled out portal vein thrombosis
   -encephalopathy improving though remains somnolent - cont lactulose
   -transplant evaluation - halted secondary to improvement in liver
   function
   Depression
   -holding on psychiatric medications
   Respiratory failure
   -Successfully extubated.  Doing well
   Encephalopathy
   -still very somnolent though better than yesterday
   -cont lactulose
   Acute kidney injury
   -Cr increasing - 3.3 though rate of rise slowing so appears to be
   peaking
   -ATN vs. HRS - suspect former more likely
   -appreciate renal consult -- failure most c/w ATN based on sediment,
   data, history

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute liver injury presumed due to Tylenol ingestion. He is currently sedated and encephalopathic, but showing some improvement. His respiratory failure has been resolved as he was successfully extubated. There is a concern for depression, and he is being held on psychiatric medications. The patient's acute kidney injury is suspected to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and a renal consult has been appreciated. His liver function tests are improving, and a transplant evaluation has been halted due to improvement in liver function. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, and he is well-nourished. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is improving, but he remains somnolent. Continuous lactulose administration is being continued to manage this condition.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's serum creatinine level is increasing, indicating an ongoing kidney injury. ATN is suspected as the cause, but further evaluation and management by a renal consultant are recommended.
3. Liver failure: Although the patient's liver function tests are trending downward, there is still a risk of liver failure. Close monitoring and potential intervention such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration may be necessary.
4. Depression: The patient's psychiatric medications should be continued to"
