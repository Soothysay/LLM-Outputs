   81 yo male with history of CML now presenting with altered mental
   status and hyperkalemia following clinic visit where patient noted to
   be substnatially somnolent requiring admission.  In the setting of
   sedation for CT scan patient with worsening mental status and to [**Hospital Ward Name **]
   ICU for further care with prominent findings of fever, leukocytosis and
   pulmonary infiltrate.
   1)Altered Mental Status--Likely related to pneumonia as primary insult
   in addition to multiple primary metabolic derangements defined below.
   On balance patient has shown substantial improvement overnight.
   -OOB to chair
   -Rx as below
   -Hold benzodiazepines
   2)Hypekalemia-
   -Improved through to this morning with Kayexalate
   -Will continue with monitoring and minimize any K+ intake
   -repeat Kayexalate to achieve K+ <5.5
   3)Pneumonia-
   -Azithromycin/CTX
   -Follow up sputum cultures, urine legionella and viral cultures
   -Tachypnea persistent and likely related to both
   infection/anxiety/fever contributing to mild metabolic alkalosis as
   well as the metabolic acidosis
   4)Acidemia-Is non-gap at admission and has been demonstrated to be
   likely renal source
   -Will support renal failure
   -Would consider HCO3- for any further worsening combined with worsening
   tachypnea
   5)Acute Renal Failure-Patient with findings to suggest that intrinsic
   renal insult is present--with FENa increased and suggestion of renal
   source of non-anion gap acidosis.  Will need further definition of

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). He presented with altered mental status, hyperkalemia, and pneumonia after a clinic visit. The patient required admission to the hospital and subsequently to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening mental status, fever, leukocytosis, and pulmonary infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to pneumonia as the primary insult, along with multiple metabolic derangements.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia has improved with the use of Kayexalate, but monitoring and minimizing potassium intake will continue. Repeat Kayexalate will be given to achieve potassium levels below 5.5.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for pneumonia. Follow-up sputum cultures, urine legionella, and viral cultures will be done.
4. Acidemia: The patient's non-gap acidemia at admission is likely of renal origin. Support for renal failure will be provided, and consideration will be given to bicarbonate for any further worsening combined with worsening tachypnea.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has findings suggesting intrinsic renal insult, with increased fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and a renal source of non-anion gap acidosis."

   Assessment:  81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to
   clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and
   acute-on-chronic renal failure.  Admitted for workup and became acutely
   agitated in CT.  Received iv ativan x1 and became unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Concern for infectious process given fever to
   102.5, received cefepime in ED.  Cultures sent, received cefepime in
   clinic. UA negative. Originally concerning for meningitis, but patient
   is mentating well without meningeal signs., so PNA is most likely cause
   given LL infiltrates. Repeat WBC 9.4 is down from last evening (11.7).
   CXR with  RLL/LLL PNA on my read.
   - f/u cx
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin x 7 days.
   - DFA pending.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Unclear cause, likely due to renal insufficiency or a
   consequence of his non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Will not start
   calcium gluconate yet because there are no PR interval changes on the
   ECG.
   -Will start 10 U insulin with D50.
   -Kayexelate per rectum
   -Bicarbonate 45 mEq
   # Non Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Differential diagnosis includes
   diarrhea or type 1, 2, 4 RTA, hyperalimentation, or normal saline fluid
   overload. Unable to determine if patient has been having diarrhea
   recently due to somnolence. Current serum bicarbonate of 13 is
   decreased from 16 tonight. This may be a result impaired ammonium
   excretion secondary to decreasing kidney function, as urinary anion gap
   is +32, which indicates Type 1 or Type 4 RTA
   -Will treat with bicarbonate as above
   -Continue to monitor urine output
   -Renal U/S to evaluate for postrenal causes and kidney size
   .
   # Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine of 2.6 is above baseline
   of 1.5-2. FeNa is 2.5 which indicates an intrinsic renal deficiency ,
   may be a result of RTA as above. Other diagnoses include interstitial
   nephritis (patient is on ASA) , or ATN, though patient has had renal
   dysfunction over a long period of time and only a mild insufficiency
   lately.
   - Urinary AG is +32, concerning for RTA as above
   - 250 mL normal saline bolus
   # CML: On dasatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 221**]. Per last note by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 221**], patient has been tolerating dasatinib. Current dose of 50mg
   daily.
   - Will monitor for s/s of bone marrow suppression. Daily CBC.
   - f/u onc recs
   # Hyponatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be SIADH as patient has neurologic involvement, but
   may also be volume depletion.
   - Urine electrolytes as above
   - Morning cortisol pending
   # CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): Stable.
   -Continue ASA
   # Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No peripheral edema. Pacer
   in place with HR ~ 80 bpm.
   -Will continue gentle fluid correction with 250mL saline bolus as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are altered mental status and hyperkalemia. The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who presented to the clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. 

The patient was admitted for further evaluation and became acutely agitated in the CT scan. He received intravenous ativan but became unresponsive. The patient has a fever of 102.5, received cefepime in the emergency department, and cultures were sent. The patient was also given cefepime in the clinic. Urine analysis was negative, initially concerning for meningitis, but the patient is mentating well without meningeal signs, so pneumonia (PNA) is the most likely cause given lower lobe infiltrates. Repeat white blood cell count is down from the previous evening, and a follow-up chest X-ray is needed. The patient will continue to receive ceftriaxone and azithromycin for 7 days, and DFA (direct fluorescence antibody) pending.

The patient has hyperkalemia, which is unclear in origin, likely due to renal insufficiency or a consequence of his non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. No calcium gluconate will be started because there are no PR interval changes on the EKG. Insulin with D50 will be started, along"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male admit with hyperkalemia and hypoxia evolving in the setting
   of altered mental status.  This is in the setting of significant renal
   failure with anion gap acidosis.
   1)Hyperkalemia-
   -Corrected to normal range
   -Was likely related to renal failure
   -Has improved with Rx
   -MOve to qd checking
   2)Respiratory Failure/Respiratory Distress- [**Month (only) 8**] be component of
   aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia
   -Urine Legionella and Influenza
negative
   -Continue with 7 day course of antibiotics
   -Pulomonary Edema was clearly present yesterday with need for mild
   diuresis and move to even balance today given acute pulmonary edema
   yesterday
   3)Altered Mental Status-Likley multifactorial metabolic insult as
   defined in the initial admission process.   He does have some
   significant improvement with treatment for pneumonia and improved
   stabilization of his volume status.
   -Continue to follow exam
   -Will need to consider patient baseline in formulation of change
   4)Acute Renal Failure
Patient baseline presumed to be near 2.0
   -Continue hydration
   -Will expect to move to baseline with stability of volume status in the
   setting of cardiac dysfunction and need for diuresis
   5)Acidosis
Patient with evolution of anion gap acidosis.  This has
   evolved over past days from non-gap to anion gap.
   -Will pursue ABG for definition of acidemia or alkalemia
   -As initial pass will look to lactate and ketones for possible source
   -This was similar at presentation but the AG is up a bit from admission
   in what should be a path to improvement

 .H/O HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assessment:  81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to
   clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and
   acute-on-chronic renal failure.  Admitted for workup and became acutely
   agitated in CT.  Received iv ativan x1 and became unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Appears to be resolving, though expressive
   aphasia is more prominent than before.  This may be a result of an
   increased lucidity following normalization of his electrolytes. Unclear
   if this is his baseline. Patient
s daughter is coming in today, so will
   speak to her regarding his baseline. No focal deficits on exam, and CT
   scan of 2 days ago showed no acute process. Unlikely to be related to
   pneumonia, as he has been treated with antibiotics for 3 days, has not
   been febrile, and does not have a leukocytosis. DFA negative, so
   influenza unlikely.
   -Urine legionella, C.Diff, and DFA are all negative.
   -Would consider repeat CT scan or MRI if symptoms worsen or patient is
   not at baseline.
   #Pneumonia: Patient has congestion of pulmonary vessels on CXR, but
   this may be an evolving pneumonia. Patient has been saturating well on
   3L, so O2 via NC has been discontinued. Now saturating 94% on RA.
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin x 7 days (Today = Day 3)
   - No CXR necessary for tomorrow morning as yet.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolving. Normal this morning at 4.8. Unclear cause,
   likely due to renal insufficiency or a consequence of his chronic
   metabolic acidosis. Will not start calcium gluconate yet because there
   are no PR interval changes on the ECG.
   -Will check K level again at 5 PM
   -Bicarbonate repletion
   -If needed, would add D50 bolus with 10 U insulin to correct, or
   Kayexelate PR PRN.
   #Acid/base status: ABG of 7.49/18/73 and bicarbonate of 15. This is
   likely a respiratory compensation for a chronic metabolic acidosis,
   which may be due to his underlying kidney disease, or may be due to
   chronic hyperkalemia (H+/K+ membrane exchange). He has evolved from a
   non-anion gap to anion gap acidosis, but ABG reveals an alkalemia.
   Albumin levels are normal at 4.5. Lactate level of 1.5 makes lactic
   acidosis unlikely, urine was negative for ketones, so DKA unlikely.
   Patient previously had a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis yesterday of
   which the differential diagnosis included diarrhea or type 1, 2, 4 RTA,
   hyperalimentation, or normal saline fluid overload. Renal ultrasound
   showed no evidence of hydronephrosis and an incidental left renal cyst.
   -Will obtain urine Na, Cr, Cl, and Osm to calculate urinary anion gap
   and fractional excretion of sodium
   -Would obtain renal consult to ascertain other possible etiologies
   -Will treat with bicarbonate as above
   -Continue to monitor urine output (3245 mL in the past 24 hours)
   -Will obtain U/A for urine pH
   # Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine of 2.4 is above baseline
   of 1.5-2. FeNa yesterday was 2.5, which indicated renal etiology, and
   is unlikely to have changed over the interval.
   - Urinary electrolytes and Osm as above
   - Would consider renal consult as above
   - Goal I/O: even. 250 mL normal saline boluses PRN
   hypotension/tachycardia.
   # CML: On dasatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 221**]. Per last note by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 221**], patient has been tolerating dasatinib. Current dose of 50mg
   daily.
   - Will monitor for s/s of bone marrow suppression. Daily CBC.
   - f/u onc recs
   # Hyponatremia: Likely result of chronic renal failure. [**Month (only) 8**] be SIADH as
   patient has neurologic involvement, but may also be volume depletion.
   Serum cortisol is high at 29.7, which may be a stress response to his
   pneumonia, but rules out adrenal insufficiency and Type 1 RTA.
   - Urine electrolytes as above
   # CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): Stable. Home dose
   metoprolol restarted yesterday as BP has stabilized. Not on a statin or
   ACE-I- would consider starting these as outpatient.
   -Continue metoprolol
   -Continue ASA
   # Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No peripheral edema. Pacer
   in place with HR ~ 80 bpm.
   -Will continue gentle fluid correction with 250mL saline bolus as above
   and continue to monitor.
    # HTN: Stable. Continue to monitor. Continue metoprolol.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable. Would consider statin as outpatient but
   would not start now.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) admitted to the ICU with symptoms of tachypnea, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient was found to have pneumonia, fevers, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has shown significant improvement in mental status but still has persistent tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. The non-AG acidosis may be related to renal tubular acidosis (RTA) given the positive urine AG. The respiratory alkalosis may be more likely related to central causes.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): Treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Continue to wean O2 as possible. Follow up imaging after completion of pneumonia course.
2. Altered Mental Status: Much improved through the morning with the patient alert and interactive. Continue to follow up remaining labs with RPR pending.
3. Hyperkalemia: Resolved at this time.
4. Acidosis: Clearly related to renal source and most likely Type IV given increased K+. Suggest start of HCO3- today as [Hospital1] dosing. Reasonable to consult renal if desired for long-term management. This would unify K+ increase as well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, worsening mental status, development of further infections, and potential complications related to"

   Assessment:  81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to
   clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and
   acute-on-chronic renal failure.  Admitted for workup and became acutely
   agitated in CT.  Received iv ativan x1 and became unresponsive.
   #Pneumonia: Patient has congestion of pulmonary vessels on CXR, but
   this may be an evolving pneumonia. Patient has been saturating well on
   3L, so O2 via NC has been discontinued. Now saturating 98% on RA.
   - Ceftriaxone x 7 days (Today = Day 4) and Azithromycin x 5 days (Today
   = Day 4)
   - No CXR necessary as symptoms are resolving and patient is saturating
   well.
   #Alkalemia/Metabolic acidosis: ABG of 7.46/22/89 and bicarbonate of 13.
   Anion gap of 15, Delta/Delta of 6, Urinary anion gap of 46. This
   complicated picture is likely a respiratory alkalosis driven by
   tachypnea secondary to pneumonia, and a chronic metabolic acidosis,
   which may be due to his underlying kidney disease (the positive urinary
   anion gap is concerning for Type 4 RTA), or may be due to chronic
   hyperkalemia (H+/K+ membrane exchange). He has evolved from a non-anion
   gap to anion gap acidosis. Albumin levels are normal at 4.5. Lactate
   level of 1.5 makes lactic acidosis unlikely, urine was negative for
   ketones, so DKA unlikely. Patient previously had a non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis yesterday of which the differential diagnosis
   included diarrhea or type 1, 2, 4 RTA, hyperalimentation, or normal
   saline fluid overload. Patient has not been on carbonic anhydrase
   inhibitors as far as can be ascertained. As hyponatremia has resolved,
   this is unlikely to be a type 1 RTA. Renal ultrasound showed no
   evidence of hydronephrosis and an incidental left renal cyst.
   - Will replete bicarbonate with 1300mg NaHCO3 [**Hospital1 **] (36 mEq bicarb/day)
   - Continue to monitor urine output (1150 mL in the past 24 hours)
   - Treating pneumonia as above
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolving. Normal this morning at 4.7. Unclear cause,
   likely due to renal insufficiency or a consequence of his chronic
   metabolic acidosis. Will not start calcium gluconate yet because there
   are no PR interval changes on the ECG.
   -Will continue to monitor q day
   -If needed, would add D50 bolus with 10 U insulin to correct, or
   Kayexelate PR PRN.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Appears to be resolving, as patient
   expressive aphasia has decreased markedly since yesterday. Unclear if
   this is his baseline. No focal deficits on exam, and CT scan of 2 days
   ago showed no acute process. Unlikely to be related to pneumonia, as he
   has been treated with antibiotics for 3 days, has not been febrile, and
   does not have a leukocytosis. DFA negative, so influenza unlikely.
   -Urine legionella, C.Diff, and DFA are all negative.
   -RPR pending per BMT recommendations
   -Would consider repeat CT scan or MRI if symptoms worsen or patient is
   not at baseline.
    # Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: New FeNa of 0.9% suggests prerenal
   etiology in addition to his chronic intrinsic renal failure. Creatinine
   of 2.1 is above baseline of 1.5-2, but has been trending downwards from
   about ~2.5. FeNa yesterday was 2.5, which indicated renal etiology,
   however, new FeNa suggests a pre-renal etiology. Likely both factors
   are present.
   - Goal I/O: even. 250 mL normal saline boluses PRN
   hypotension/tachycardia.
   # CML: On dasatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 221**]. Per last note by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 221**], patient has been tolerating dasatinib. Current dose of 50mg
   daily.
   - Will monitor for s/s of bone marrow suppression. Daily CBC.
   - f/u onc recs
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving. Normal today at 135. Likely result of
   chronic renal failure. [**Month (only) 8**] be SIADH as patient has neurologic
   involvement, but may also be volume depletion. Serum cortisol is high
   at 29.7, which may be a stress response to his pneumonia, but rules out
   adrenal insufficiency and Type 1 RTA.
   - Urine electrolytes as above
   # CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): Stable. Home dose
   metoprolol restarted yesterday as BP has stabilized. Not on a statin or
   ACE-I- would consider starting these as outpatient.
   -Continue metoprolol
   -Continue ASA
   # Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No peripheral edema. Pacer
   in place with HR ~ 80 bpm.
   -Will continue gentle fluid correction with 250mL saline bolus as above
   and continue to monitor.
    # HTN: Stable. Continue to monitor. Continue metoprolol.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable. Would consider statin as outpatient but
   would not start now.
   #Access: Patient has PIV. Can remove right EJ

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who presented to the clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He was admitted for further evaluation and became acutely agitated in the CT scan. He received IV ativan but became unresponsive.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has congestion of pulmonary vessels on CXR, but this may be an evolving pneumonia. He is saturating well on room air, so oxygen via nasal cannula has been discontinued. He is now saturating at 98% on room air.
