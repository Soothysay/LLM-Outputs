   Assessment and Plan
    [**Age over 90 **]yo M with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinsons, and [**Hospital1 69**] dependant
   at baseline presenting after cardiac arrest, now on hypothermia
   protocol.
   .
   #) Arrest: Both the cause of arrest and the heart rhythm during arrest
   remain uncertain. Details are from EMS records and are limited. Per
   report it is suspicious for asphyxiation leading to cardiopulmonary
   arrest with asystole given that he was found to have food at the vocal
   cords and he had an ""non shockable"" rhythm. His history does not
   support other common causes of PEA/asystole, and his lab abnormalities
   are likely a result and not cause of arrest. We cannot rule out a
   ventricular arrythmia, but again his findings of cardiac infarction are
   more likely the result and not cause of arrest. Regardless of cause, he
   received excellent life support care with rapid CPR and relatively fast
   return of spontaneous circulation. He has been started on the arctic
   sun cooling protocol and we will continue provided he tolerates it.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol. Reached goal 34C at 15:30 [**3-1**].
   - Bolus NS to increase MAP and given elevated lactate
   - Continue norepinephrine drip to maintain MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - Monitor ABG, coags, electrolytes q4-6 hours
   - Replete K and Mg as needed
   - Will remain intubated on AC
   - Monitoring on telemetry for any arrythmias
   -Consider ECHO to assess cardiac status
   - Plan to rewarm tomorrow after 18-24 hours (9:30-15:30)
   .
   #) Anion Gap: Patient has an anion gap with an elevated lactate, both
   of which are improving with IV fluids and improved hemodynamic status.
   This is secondary to cardiac arrest and resultant poor perfusion.
   - Continue agressive IVF boluses
   - Monitor lytes and lactate
   .
   #) Bifrontal subdural fluid collections - Patient with known chronic
   subdural hematomas. CT concerning for possible new acute progression in
   left frontal area. Seen by neurosurgery. No need for acute
   intervention.
   - Appreciate neurosurgery input
   - Plan to reimage in 24 hours
   .
   #) Neurologic impairment - Patient's neurologic exam is concerning for
   significant impairment secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to
   anoxic brain injury/encephalitis. He is being sedated but there is no
   report of administration of paralytic agents to explain his whole body
   loss of tone and areflexia. This is concerning regarding his prognosis
   for return of neurolgic function. We will continue hypothermia as
   above, maintain MAP for cerebral perfusion, and follow clinically. If
   concern increases for worsening neurologic function/ increased ICP will
   consider mannitor and hypoventilation. Plan for repeat imaging as
   above.
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: There is no evidence on exam or CXR of
   respiratory failure or significant gas exchange abnormality and no
   evidence of further aspiration. Maintain on mandatory ventilation while
   cooling. Wean O2 as tolerated. His peak airway pressures have been in
   the 30s. This may be due to some obstructive airway disease at
   baseline/ elevated lung volumes.
   -Home inhalers
   -Decrease tidal volume
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow given concern for aspiration
   .
   #) Acute Kidney Injury - Patient has an elevated creatinine likely due
   to prerenal azotemia. This could be strictly prerenal or may have
   progressed to ATN. It is reassuring that his creatinine is now trending
   down. Rhabdomyolsis is unlikely given the normal CK.
   - Continue IVFs and trend creatinine as above, with goal UO>30cc/hr
   - Further workup with UA and sediment if worsening renal status
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs - Patient has an elevated AST, with normal Alk phos
   and bilirubin. AST is non specific and could indicate cardiac
   infarction. If there is liver injury, this is likely shock liver due to
   hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. We will continue to follow labs.
   .
   #) Coagulopathy - Patient has elevated coags with a normal fibrinogen.
   His coagulopathy is unlikely to be DIC given his normal fibrinogen.
   There is no obvious cause however it may be due to cardiopulmonary
   arrest leading to some thrombus formation with lysis on return of
   circulation. It is improving on repeat labs. Will continue to follow
   closely.
   .
   #) ST depressions - EKG shows precordial ST depressions and Troponin is
   elevated. This is likely secondary to arrest and CPR leading to cardiac
   myocyte damage. ACS is unlikely by history.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia - Patients elevated phosphate is likely due to
   lactic acidosis leading to a shift of intracellular phosphate. This may
   be worsened by acute renal failure and inability to excrete excess
   phosphate. Rhabomyolysis is unlikey given the normal CK. It is now
   trending down with improvement of his lactic acidosis. Will continue to
   follow.
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia - Patients hypocalcemia may be secondary to
   hyperphosphatemia and resultant deposition of calcium and phosphate
   into bone. His calcium X phosphate product was initially ~60 concerning
   for risk of precipitation, however on repeat the product is decreased
   to within normal limtis. Alternatively may be secondary to shock and
   impaired PTH secretion/action. Given the acuity of the drop, IV calcium
   repletion is warranted.
   -IV calcium gluconate with goal Ionized Ca 1-1.1
   .
   #) ? Seizure activity
 per EMS report the patient may have had
   tonic-clonic movements on presentation concerning for a seizure. He is
   now atonic. Does not appear to be actively seizing, but will consider
   non-convulsive status if clinical picture/rising CK suggests this. No
   known history as noted above.
   -Trend CK
   -Consider EEG tomorrow if clinical concern
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and dependent at baseline presenting after cardiac arrest. The patient is currently on hypothermia protocol.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Anion gap: The patient has an anion gap with elevated lactate, which is improving with IV fluids and improved hemodynamic status. This is secondary to cardiac arrest and resultant poor perfusion. The patient should continue aggressive IV fluid boluses, monitoring electrolytes and lactate levels.

2. Neurologic impairment: The patient's neurologic exam is concerning for significant impairment secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to anoxic brain injury/encephalitis. There is no evidence of administration of paralytic agents to explain the whole body loss of tone and areflexia. The patient should continue hypothermia as above, maintain MAP for cerebral perfusion, and follow clinically. If concern increases for worsening neurologic function/increased ICP, consider mannitol and hypoventilation. Plan for repeat imaging as above.

3. Respiratory failure: There is no evidence on exam or CXR of respiratory failure or significant gas exchange abnormality and no evidence of further aspiration. Maintain on mandatory ventilation while cooling. Wean O2 as tolerated. His peak airway pressures have been in the 30s. This may be due to some obstructive airway"

   are likely a result and not cause of arrest. We cannot rule out a
   ventricular arrythmia, but again his findings of cardiac infarction are
   more likely the result and not cause of arrest. Regardless of cause, he
   received excellent life support care with rapid CPR and relatively fast
   return of spontaneous circulation. He has been started on the arctic
   sun cooling protocol and we will continue provided he tolerates it.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol. Reached goal 34C at 15:30 [**3-1**].
   - Bolus NS to increase MAP and given elevated lactate
   - Continue norepinephrine drip to maintain MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - Monitor ABG, coags, electrolytes q4-6 hours
   - Replete K and Mg as needed
   - Will remain intubated on AC
   - Monitoring on telemetry for any arrythmias
   -Consider ECHO to assess cardiac status
   - Plan to rewarm tomorrow after 18-24 hours (9:30-15:30)
   .
   #) Anion Gap: Patient has an anion gap with an elevated lactate, both
   of which are improving with IV fluids and improved hemodynamic status.
   This is secondary to cardiac arrest and resultant poor perfusion.
   - Continue agressive IVF boluses
   - Monitor lytes and lactate
   .
   #) Bifrontal subdural fluid collections - Patient with known chronic
   subdural hematomas. CT concerning for possible new acute progression in
   left frontal area. Seen by neurosurgery. No need for acute
   intervention.
   - Appreciate neurosurgery input
   - Plan to reimage in 24 hours
   .
   #) Neurologic impairment - Patient's neurologic exam is concerning for
   significant impairment secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to
   anoxic brain injury/encephalitis. He is being sedated but there is no
   report of administration of paralytic agents to explain his whole body
   loss of tone and areflexia. This is concerning regarding his prognosis
   for return of neurolgic function. We will continue hypothermia as
   above, maintain MAP for cerebral perfusion, and follow clinically. If
   concern increases for worsening neurologic function/ increased ICP will
   consider mannitor and hypoventilation. Plan for repeat imaging as
   above.
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: There is no evidence on exam or CXR of
   respiratory failure or significant gas exchange abnormality and no
   evidence of further aspiration. Maintain on mandatory ventilation while
   cooling. Wean O2 as tolerated. His peak airway pressures have been in
   the 30s. This may be due to some obstructive airway disease at
   baseline/ elevated lung volumes.
   -Home inhalers
   -Decrease tidal volume
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow given concern for aspiration
   .
   #) Acute Kidney Injury - Patient has an elevated creatinine likely due
   to prerenal azotemia. This could be strictly prerenal or may have
   progressed to ATN. It is reassuring that his creatinine is now trending
   down. Rhabdomyolsis is unlikely given the normal CK.
   - Continue IVFs and trend creatinine as above, with goal UO>30cc/hr
   - Further workup with UA and sediment if worsening renal status
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs - Patient has an elevated AST, with normal Alk phos
   and bilirubin. AST is non specific and could indicate cardiac
   infarction. If there is liver injury, this is likely shock liver due to
   hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. We will continue to follow labs.
   .
   #) Coagulopathy - Patient has elevated coags with a normal fibrinogen.
   His coagulopathy is unlikely to be DIC given his normal fibrinogen.
   There is no obvious cause however it may be due to cardiopulmonary
   arrest leading to some thrombus formation with lysis on return of
   circulation. It is improving on repeat labs. Will continue to follow
   closely.
   .
   #) ST depressions - EKG shows precordial ST depressions and Troponin is
   elevated. This is likely secondary to arrest and CPR leading to cardiac
   myocyte damage. ACS is unlikely by history.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia - Patients elevated phosphate is likely due to
   lactic acidosis leading to a shift of intracellular phosphate. This may
   be worsened by acute renal failure and inability to excrete excess
   phosphate. Rhabomyolysis is unlikey given the normal CK. It is now
   trending down with improvement of his lactic acidosis. Will continue to
   follow.
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia - Patients hypocalcemia may be secondary to
   hyperphosphatemia and resultant deposition of calcium and phosphate
   into bone. His calcium X phosphate product was initially ~60 concerning
   for risk of precipitation, however on repeat the product is decreased
   to within normal limtis. Alternatively may be secondary to shock and
   impaired PTH secretion/action. Given the acuity of the drop, IV calcium
   repletion is warranted.
   -IV calcium gluconate with goal Ionized Ca 1-1.1
   .
   #) ? Seizure activity
 per EMS report the patient may have had
   tonic-clonic movements on presentation concerning for a seizure. He is
   now atonic. Does not appear to be actively seizing, but will consider
   non-convulsive status if clinical picture/rising CK suggests this. No
   known history as noted above.
   -Trend CK
   -Consider EEG tomorrow if clinical concern

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and dependent status at baseline. He presented after cardiac arrest and is now on hypothermia protocol. The patient's neurological exam is concerning for significant impairment due to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to anoxic brain injury/encephalitis. There are several medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition, including anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, respiratory failure, and possible seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated lactate level, indicating poor tissue perfusion and possible anion gap metabolic acidosis. IV fluids and improved hemodynamic status should be continued to address this complication.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, likely due to prerenal azotemia. IV fluid administration should be continued to maintain adequate renal perfusion, and trends in creatinine should be monitored.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated coagulation studies, but normal fibrinogen levels, suggesting a possible thrombus formation with lysis on return of circulation. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
4. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's elevated phosphate level is likely secondary to lactic acidosis and"

    [**Age over 90 **]yo M with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinsons, and [**Hospital1 69**] dependant
   at baseline presenting after cardiac arrest, now on hypothermia
   protocol.
   .
   #) Arrest: Patient is s/p cardiopulmonary arrest likely due to trachea
   obstruction. He is on the arctic sun cooling protocol and has tolerated
   it well without significant electrolyte or coagulation abnormalities or
   arrhythmia.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol. Plan to rewarm at ~3pm today
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, and given low UO and lactate of 3.5
   - Monitor ABG, coags, electrolytes q4-6 hours
   - Avoid K repletion for 6 hours prior to rewarming.
   - Will remain intubated on AC
   - Monitoring on telemetry for any arrythmias
   - ECHO to assess cardiac status
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with history concerning for
   aspiration. CXR now is concerning for a retrocardiac opacity as well as
   increase interstitial fluid. He does not have significant secretions.
   His ventilation requirements have not changed significantly.
   -Maintain on mandatory ventilation while cooling.
   -Home inhalers
   -Follow CXR, WBC, temperature after warming to assess for aspiration
   pneumonitis.
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Patient has an anion gap with an elevated lactate,
   both of which initially improved with IV fluids and improved
   hemodynamic status. This is secondary to cardiac arrest and resultant
   poor perfusion.
   - Continue agressive IVF boluses
   - Monitor lytes and lactate
   .
   #) Bifrontal subdural fluid collections - Patient with known chronic
   subdural hematomas. CT concerning for possible new acute progression in
   left frontal area. Seen by neurosurgery. No need for acute
   intervention.
   - Appreciate neurosurgery input
   - f/u final CT read
   -repeat head CT today
   .
   #) Neurologic impairment - Patient's neurologic exam is concerning for
   significant impairment secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to
   anoxic brain injury/encephalitis. He is being sedated but there is no
   report of administration of paralytic agents to explain his whole body
   loss of tone and areflexia. This is concerning regarding his prognosis
   for return of neurolgic function. We will continue hypothermia as
   above, maintain MAP for cerebral perfusion, and follow clinically. If
   concern increases for worsening neurologic function/ increased ICP will
   consider mannitor and hypoventilation. Plan for repeat imaging as
   above.
   .
   #) Acute Kidney Injury - Patient has an elevated creatinine likely due
   to prerenal azotemia. FENA and sediment are consistent with this. His
   creatinine remains elevated at 1.6 but baseline is unknown. His urine
   output is marginal. He may have progressed to ATN.
   - Continue IVFs and trend creatinine as above, with goal UO>30cc/hr
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs - Patient has an elevated AST, ALT, with normal Alk
   phos and bilirubin. AST is non specific and could indicate cardiac
   infarction. If there is liver injury, this is likely shock liver due to
   hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. We will continue to follow labs.
   .
   #) Coagulopathy - Patient has elevated coags with a normal fibrinogen.
   This is likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to some thrombus
   formation with lysis on return of circulation. There is no indication
   of DIC. Will continue to follow closely.
   .
   #) ST depressions - EKG initially showed precordial ST depressions and
   TWI, these have resolved and he now has inferior lead TWIs. ACS is
   unlikely by history.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia
 Likely due to either initial hyperphosphatemia
   leading to deposition in bone. Alternatively may be secondary to shock
   and impaired PTH secretion/action. Given the acuity of the drop, IV
   calcium repletion is warranted.
   -IV calcium gluconate with goal Ionized Ca 1.1-1.2
   .
   #) ? Seizure activity
 per EMS report the patient may have had
   tonic-clonic movements on presentation concerning for a seizure. He is
   now atonic with some clonic jerks likely secondary to hypothermia.
   -Trend CK
   -EEG today to help r/o seizure activity

   Assessment and Plan
    [**Age over 90 **]yo M with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinsons, and [**Hospital1 69**] dependant
   at baseline presenting after cardiac arrest, now on hypothermia
   protocol.
   .
   #) Arrest: Patient is s/p cardiopulmonary arrest likely due to trachea
   obstruction. He is on the arctic sun cooling protocol and has tolerated
   it well without significant electrolyte or coagulation abnormalities or
   arrhythmia.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol. Plan to rewarm at ~3pm today
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, and given low UO and lactate of 3.5
   - Monitor ABG, coags, electrolytes q4-6 hours
   - Avoid K repletion for 6 hours prior to rewarming.
   - Will remain intubated on AC
   - Monitoring on telemetry for any arrythmias
   - ECHO to assess cardiac status
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with history concerning for
   aspiration. CXR now is concerning for a retrocardiac opacity as well as
   increase interstitial fluid. He does not have significant secretions.
   His ventilation requirements have not changed significantly.
   -Maintain on mandatory ventilation while cooling.
   -Home inhalers
   -Follow CXR, WBC, temperature after warming to assess for aspiration
   pneumonitis.
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Patient has an anion gap with an elevated lactate,
   both of which initially improved with IV fluids and improved
   hemodynamic status. This is secondary to cardiac arrest and resultant
   poor perfusion.
   - Continue agressive IVF boluses
   - Monitor lytes and lactate
   .
   #) Bifrontal subdural fluid collections - Patient with known chronic
   subdural hematomas. CT concerning for possible new acute progression in
   left frontal area. Seen by neurosurgery. No need for acute
   intervention.
   - Appreciate neurosurgery input
   - f/u final CT read
   -repeat head CT today
   .
   #) Neurologic impairment - Patient's neurologic exam is concerning for
   significant impairment secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to
   anoxic brain injury/encephalitis. He is being sedated but there is no
   report of administration of paralytic agents to explain his whole body
   loss of tone and areflexia. This is concerning regarding his prognosis
   for return of neurolgic function. We will continue hypothermia as
   above, maintain MAP for cerebral perfusion, and follow clinically. If
   concern increases for worsening neurologic function/ increased ICP will
   consider mannitor and hypoventilation. Plan for repeat imaging as
   above.
   .
   #) Acute Kidney Injury - Patient presented with an elevated creatinine
   likely due to prerenal azotemia. FENA and sediment are consistent with
   this. His creatinine is now 1.6 which is at his baseline. His urine
   output is marginal remains marginal.
   - Continue IVFs and trend creatinine as above, with goal UO>30cc/hr
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs - Patient has an elevated AST, ALT, with normal Alk
   phos and bilirubin. AST is non specific and could indicate cardiac
   infarction. If there is liver injury, this is likely shock liver due to
   hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. We will continue to follow labs.
   .
   #) Coagulopathy - Patient has elevated coags with a normal fibrinogen.
   This is likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to some thrombus
   formation with lysis on return of circulation. There is no indication
   of DIC. Will continue to follow closely.
   .
   #) ST depressions - EKG initially showed precordial ST depressions and
   TWI, these have resolved and he now has inferior lead TWIs. ACS is
   unlikely by history.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia
 Likely due to either initial hyperphosphatemia
   leading to deposition in bone. Alternatively may be secondary to shock
   and impaired PTH secretion/action. Given the acuity of the drop, IV
   calcium repletion is warranted.
   -IV calcium gluconate with goal Ionized Ca 1.1-1.2
   .
   #) ? Seizure activity
 per EMS report the patient may have had
   tonic-clonic movements on presentation concerning for a seizure. He is
   now atonic with some clonic jerks likely secondary to hypothermia.
   -Trend CK
   -EEG today to help r/o seizure activity
   .
   #) FEN:
   - NPO
   - Fluids and electrolyte replacement as above

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST:
   --Induced hypothermia:  Begin warming after 24 hours.
   --Continue monitoring serial labs
   --Echo today
   >Altered mental status:
   Possible nonconvulsive seizure vs secondary to arrest and anoxic
   injury.
   Check EEG.
   Once rewarming, awaken and assess neuro exam.
   >Respiratory Failure:
   Oxygenation has been stable.  Wean FiO2 and try PSV.
   No evidence of pneumonia clinically, so hold off on antibiotics.
   >Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline renal function unknown.
   Creatinine has plateaud and remains oliguric.
   Likely ATN from arrest--continue to monitor, if increasing signs of
   volume overload, consider lasix.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes, patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide a history. There are no known drug allergies. The patient has been on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for seizure activity and possible food aspiration. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 32.6°C (90.7°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and central venous pressure is 14 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,918 mL since 12 AM and output of 177 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH of 7.27, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 272, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 19 mEq/L. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, has an endotracheal tube and orogastric tube in place, and exhibits clear breath sounds. The patient's extremities are absent pulses in both the right and left distal pulses. The patient shows signs of muscle wasting and is sedated with non-purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.5 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 137 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 42 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.04, and glucose level of 97 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Imaging shows mild vascular congestion and left lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate on chest X-ray. Microbiology results are negative for any new data. 

The patient's assessment includes cardiac arrest, altered mental status possibly due to nonconvulsive seizure or anoxic injury, respiratory failure with stable oxygenation, and acute renal failure with oliguria and plateaued creatinine levels. 

The plan includes inducing hypothermia, monitoring serial labs, performing an echocardiogram, checking EEG, rewarming the patient after 24 hours, and assessing neuro exam once awake. The respiratory support plan involves weaning FiO2 and trying pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's acute renal failure requires monitoring and consideration of lasix if signs of volume overload occur. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, multi-lumen and arterial lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST:
   --Induced hypothermia:  Begin warming after 24 hours.
   --Continue monitoring serial labs
   --Echo today
   >Altered mental status:
   Possible nonconvulsive seizure vs secondary to arrest and anoxic
   injury.
   Check EEG.
   Once rewarming, awaken and assess neuro exam.
   >Respiratory Failure:
   Oxygenation has been stable.  Wean FiO2.
   Maintain on AC.
   No evidence of pneumonia clinically so hold off on antibiotics.
   >Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline renal function unknown.
   Creatinine has plateaud and remains oliguric.
   Likely ATN from arrest--continue to monitor, if increasing signs of
   volume overload, consider lasix.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male who experienced cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide a history. He has undergone various interventions, including induced hypothermia, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen line insertion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 32.6°C (90.7°F), heart rate between 59-67 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and ABG results indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient has an endotracheal tube in place and is receiving fluids through IV.

Physical examination reveals muscle wasting, absence of peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, and non-purposeful movements. Neurological assessment shows the patient responding to commands but not assessed, with myoclonic jerks observed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. Imaging reveals mild vascular congestion and atelectasis/infiltrate in the left lower lobe of the lungs"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo M with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinsons, and [**Hospital1 69**] dependant at
   baseline presenting after cardiac arrest, now on hypothermia protocol.
   .
   #) Arrest: Patient is s/p cardiopulmonary arrest likely due to trachea
   obstruction. Tolerated cooling well, now rewarmed
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, and given low UO and lactate of 3.5
   - Monitor ABG, coags, electrolytes q4-6 hours
   - Avoid K repletion for 6 hours prior to rewarming.
   - Monitoring on telemetry for any arrythmias
   - ECHO results above.
   - Lactate continues to improve
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with history concerning for
   aspiration. CXR now is concerning for a retrocardiac opacity as well as
   increase interstitial fluid. On pressure support [**4-20**], RSBI 40 without
   significant secretions.
   -Home inhalers
   -Follow CXR, WBC, temperature after warming to assess for aspiration
   pneumonitis
   -SBT will also eval brain function
   .
   #) Neurologic impairment
 Anoxic brain injury vs status epilepticus vs
   sedation vs increased ICP due to enlarging chronic SDH or new process
   especially in setting of worsening anemia.
   - repeat CT head today.
   - neurosurg: no need for acute intervention
   .
   #) Anemia
 Hct slowly trending down from 30s, initially was 9 but
   likely lab error. No evidence of active bleed.
   - CT head to eval IC bleeding
   - ? effects of cooling
   - blood T+C, active until [**3-4**]
   - no need for transfusion yet.
   .
   #) Acute Kidney Injury
 Initial Cr 1.9, thought to be prerenal based
   on FeNA and sediment. Improved to 1.5 and now 1.7. Baseline normal.
   Urine output adequate
   - IVF prn with D5 bicarb given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs - Patient has an elevated AST, ALT, with normal Alk
   phos and bilirubin. AST is non specific and could indicate cardiac
   infarction. If there is liver injury, this is likely shock liver due to
   hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. We will continue to follow labs.
   .
   #) Coagulopathy - Patient has elevated coags with a normal fibrinogen.
   This is likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest leading to some thrombus
   formation with lysis on return of circulation. There is no indication
   of DIC. Will continue to follow closely.
   .
   #) ST depressions - EKG initially showed precordial ST depressions and
   TWI, these have resolved and he now has inferior lead TWIs. ACS is
   unlikely by history.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia
 Likely due to either initial hyperphosphatemia
   leading to deposition in bone. Alternatively may be secondary to shock
   and impaired PTH secretion/action.
   -IV calcium gluconate with goal Ionized Ca 1.1-1.2
   .
   #) ? Seizure activity
 per EMS report the patient may have had
   tonic-clonic movements on presentation concerning for a seizure. Also
   had some myoclonic jerks thought to be due to hypothermia.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and dependent at baseline presenting after cardiac arrest, now on hypothermia protocol. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Heart rate: 67 bpm (within normal range)
- Blood pressure: 106/45 mmHg (hypotensive)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (within normal range)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% (indicating adequate oxygenation)
- Central venous pressure: 14 mmHg (within normal range)

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450-856 mL, respiratory system resistance of 40, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.34 (slightly acidic), PaCO2 40 mmHg (within normal range), PaO2 420 mmHg (indicating good oxygenation), bicarbonate 21 mEq/L (within normal range), and base excess -3 mEq/L (indicating a mild metabolic acidosis).

The physical examination reveals a noninjected sclera, moist oropharynx without lesions, supple neck, midclavicular line point of maximal impulse, preserved S1 and S2 heart sounds,"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo M with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinsons, and [**Hospital1 69**] dependant at
   baseline presenting after cardiac arrest, now on hypothermia protocol.
   .
   #) Arrest: Patient is s/p cardiopulmonary arrest likely due to trachea
   obstruction, other etiology unlikely. Tolerated cooling well, now
   rewarmed
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, and given low UO and lactate of 3.5
   - lytes normal
   - ECHO without WMA
   - Lactate continues to improve
   - initial EKG with ST depressions, quickly resolved. Trop 0.04 after
   CPR, CK flat
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with history concerning for
   aspiration. CXR now is concerning for a retrocardiac opacity as well as
   increase interstitial fluid. On pressure support [**4-20**], RSBI 40 without
   significant secretions.
   -Home inhalers
   -Follow CXR, WBC, temperature after warming to assess for aspiration
   pneumonitis
   - extubate after results of EEG and head CT and family discussion re:
   reintubation
   .
   #) Neurologic impairment
 Anoxic brain injury vs status epilepticus vs
   sedation vs increased ICP due to enlarging chronic SDH or new process
   especially in setting of worsening anemia vs locked in syndrome
   - fu CT head today
   - f/u EEG
   - neurosurg: no need for acute intervention
   .
   #) Anemia
 Hct slowly trending down from 30s, initially was 9 but
   likely lab error. No evidence of active bleed.
   - CT head to eval IC bleeding
   - ? effects of cooling, dilution.
   - blood T+C, active until [**3-4**]
   - no need for transfusion yet.
   .
   #) Acute Kidney Injury
 Cr at baseline, likely prerenal. Urine output
   adequate
   - IVF prn with D5 bicarb given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs
 likely due to transient hypoperfusion
   - will monitor.

   I saw and examined the patient on am rounds with the fellow and ICU
   housestaff, 24 hour events reviewed.  Patient off propofol for 2 hours
   without responding to voice, noxious stimuli.  Then had episode of
   wide-complex tachycardia to 180s, SBP decreased from 180 to 107,
   lasting few minutes then broke on his own.  This episode occurred with
   suctioning.  Had recurrent run without stimulation, further BP decrease
   to 90
s, cardioverted, loaded with amiodarone, and received MgS04.
   Most consistent with SVT with aberrency.  Family updated on events with
   family meeting with his brother and [**Name2 (NI) 297**] (not HCP) and over the phone
   with [**Name (NI) 203**], HCP.  We presented our concern about his lack of
   responsiveness after being off versed/fentanyl for more than 12 hours
   and with propofol off.  Family felt neurology input would be helpful so
   they have been consulted. At this point they feel he should be a full
   code but understand poor prognosis given his age, underlying SDHs, and
   recent cardiorespiratory arrest.
   Time spent: 60 minutes for am rounds and at bedside managing

   I met with patient
s family including her brother, sister and [**Name2 (NI) 297**]
   [**Name (NI) 117**] to update them on course of events overnight.  Indicated that
   patient had progressively increasing tachypnea and anxiety overnight
   resulting in the need to intubate; likely tired in setting of copious
   secretions which she was unable to clear on her own.  Patient just back
   from her CT so let them know we would be reviewing the scans with
   oncology, radiation therapy as well as IP to collectively decide on the
   bets approach for palliation at this point.  Family aware that she may
   not be a candidate for systemic chemotherapy.  They raised concern
   about her comfort while on the ventilator and I reassured them that
   this is one of our top priorities in the ICU.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female who experienced a cardiac arrest and was intubated. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown fever, with the highest recorded temperature being 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's blood cultures were taken and she was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate ranging from 69-85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94-160 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.8 thousand/mm3, slightly decreased hemoglobin level at 9.4 g/dL, slightly elevated platelet count at 114 thousand/mm3, and normal creatinine levels at 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows a head CT that is stable and a chest X-ray revealing left lower lobe infiltrate, suggesting aspiration pneumonia. Microbiology results indicate blood culture negative for growth.

The assessment and plan include fever most likely due to left lower lobe aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring minimal ventilatory support, and altered mental status possibly due to brain injury from cardiac arrest"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 90-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently intubated in the ICU.
- The patient has a fever of 102.6°F and was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/68 to 160/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has been receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications.
- The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and responds to verbal commands but is sedated and unable to move or assess muscle tone.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging reveals a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and stable head CT.
- The patient is being treated for fever, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure with minimal ventilator settings.
- The plan is to turn off sedation and assess mental status for extubation readiness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's current fever and left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest a possible aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and systemic infection.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient"

   I saw and examined the patient on am rounds with the fellow and ICU
   housestaff, 24 hour events reviewed.  Patient off propofol for 2 hours
   without responding to voice, noxious stimuli.  Then had episode of
   wide-complex tachycardia to 180s, SBP decreased from 180 to 107,
   lasting few minutes then broke on his own.  This episode occurred with
   suctioning.  Had recurrent run without stimulation, further BP decrease
   to 90
s, cardioverted, loaded with amiodarone, and received MgS04.
   Most consistent with SVT with aberrency.  Family updated on events with
   family meeting with his brother and [**Name2 (NI) 297**] (not HCP) and over the phone
   with [**Name (NI) 203**], HCP.  We presented our concern about his lack of
   responsiveness after being off versed/fentanyl for more than 12 hours
   and with propofol off.  Family felt neurology input would be helpful so
   they have been consulted. At this point they feel he should be a full
   code but understand poor prognosis given his age, underlying SDHs, and
   recent cardiorespiratory arrest.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has a fever of 102.6 and was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 148/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and has been sedated.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, and OG tube in place. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with a regular rhythm. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Musculoskeletal examination shows muscle wasting, and neurologic examination shows sedation with no assessed movement or tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.8 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 77 to 101 mg/dL. Other lab results show normal kidney and liver function, but there are elevated levels of lactate, LDH, and troponin-T.

Imaging studies include a head CT scan showing stability and a chest X-ray"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and dependent functional status at baseline. He presented after a cardiac arrest and is currently on hypothermia protocol.

The patient experienced several runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with hypotension, which required cardioversion. He was started on amiodarone and magnesium. No further episodes of SVT were reported.

The neurologist believes that the patient's prognosis is very poor due to anoxic brain injury from the cardiac arrest. The neurologist states that there is virtually no chance of meaningful recovery and a high chance of death within the next year, even with best supportive measures. The family wants full code until they have further discussed among themselves.

The patient has been grimacing at 2am and was given fentanyl without relief. Propofol was started at 10 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/56-186/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and unresponsive to pain or voice. His pupils are unresponsive, and he has a right internal jugular line in place.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, glucose of 126 mg/dL, sodium of 126 mEq/L, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26.4 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's WBC count ranges from 10.2-12.1 K/uL, Hct is 27.4-27.2%, platelet count is 108-111 K/uL, and PT/PTT/INR is 13.6/29.3/1.2. Troponin-T is 0.04, and CK/CKMB is 217/10.

The patient's disposition is in the ICU, and his code status is full code. He requires prophylactic measures for pneumoboots and stress ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and severe cognitive impairment presenting after cardiac arrest. He is currently on a hypothermia protocol in the ICU. The patient has had several runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with associated hypotension, requiring cardioversion and treatment with magnesium and amiodarone. He is intubated and unresponsive, with downgoing toes and no response to pain or voice. The patient's neurological status is concerning for anoxic brain injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with a history concerning for aspiration, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonitis due to the retrocardiac opacity and increased interstitial fluid seen on chest X-ray.
2. Neurologic Impairment: The patient has neurological impairment with right upgoing toe and resistance with movement of extremities, which is concerning for anoxic brain injury.
3. Tachycardia: The patient experienced several runs of SVT in the setting of suctioning, with the last episode associated with hypotension. He required cardioversion and treatment with magnesium and amiodarone.
4. Infection: There is a concern for infection as evidenced by the sputum and stool cultures ordered.
5. Medication Complications: With the multiple medications and infusions, there is a potential for medication-related complications.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient being bedridden, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of DVT.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's compromised respiratory status and aspiration risk increase the likelihood of developing pneumonia."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and severe dementia presenting after cardiac arrest. He is currently on hypothermia protocol in the ICU. The patient has been intubated and is unresponsive to pain or voice. Neurological examination shows down-going toes and no response. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108-114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion, famotidine, and other medications. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine level, and low potassium level. The patient's C. difficile toxin test was negative. The patient's medical complications include likely anoxic brain injury, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient's condition remains unchanged, and the neurologist believes that the chance of meaningful recovery is very unlikely, with a high chance of death within the next year even with best supportive measures. The family wants to discuss the course of action tonight and will decide on extubation in the morning."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who is critically ill and currently unresponsive in the ICU. He has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, and a previous cardiac arrest. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, indicating a fever. His vital signs show stable rhythm, blood pressure within normal range, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count may suggest an infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can predispose the patient to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Elevated creatinine levels may indicate impaired kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such as sepsis or decreased renal perfusion.
6. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's coma and lack of response to pain suggest a significant brain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently unresponsive and on mechanical ventilation. There is a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate), and the family has yet to make a decision regarding extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/53 to 172/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics and is on various medications, including propofol, famotidine, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with decreased platelet count and potassium. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures of respiratory secretions should be done to detect early signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be implemented.
3. Nosocomial infections"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and recent cardiac arrest, currently undergoing hypothermia protocol. He is expected to be extubated at 8pm on [**3-7**] with the family at the bedside and no plans for tracheostomy or gastrostomy if extubation fails.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonitis. His chest X-ray shows a retrocardiac opacity and increased interstitial fluid. He is currently on pressure support with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 40 without significant secretions. He will continue to receive Zosyn, and plans are to extubate him at 8pm on [**3-7**] without plans for tracheostomy or gastrostomy if extubation fails.

2. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient had several runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) today, including one associated with hypotension. He required cardioversion and received magnesium and amiodarone load and drip. He has been in normal sinus rhythm since then. He will continue taking amiodarone orally for now and will replace magnesium as needed.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely suffering from anoxic brain injury following the cardiac arrest"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and previous cardiac arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest and undergoing hypothermia protocol.

The patient's family has decided to extubate at 8pm on [**3-7**] without pursuing tracheostomy or feeding tube if the patient does not successfully extubate.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 129/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, total input of 946 mL and output of 962 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 16 mL.

The patient is receiving propofol infusion, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory values indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 7.3 to 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 108 to 131 K/uL, creatinine level ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from"

","The patient in the ICU is suffering from respiratory failure, and based on the progress note, here is a summary of the information provided:

- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/53 mmHg to 151/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 405 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.23, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 23 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L.
- The patient's lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 7.3 to 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 24.8% to 27.4%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 108 to 131 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 77 to 126 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.
- The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, fever, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, and coma.
- The plan is to continue ventilatory support, extubate the patient this evening, and provide comfort care due to no hope for recovery.
- The patient's nutritional status is NPO (nothing by mouth), and they are receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The patient's risk factors for VAP include being intubated for more than 48 hours and having a low respiratory rate.

2. Barotrauma: The high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) during mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma, which is injury to the lung tissue due to excessive pressure.

3. Volutrauma: High tidal volumes used during mechanical ventilation can lead to volutrauma, causing overdistension of the alveoli and subsequent lung injury.

4. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The combination of high tidal volumes and high PEEP can result in VILI, leading to inflammation and damage to the lungs.

5. Pneumonia: Immobility and prolonged intubation increase the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/53 mmHg to 151/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's current weight is 65.2 kg.

The patient's medical history includes cardiac dysrhythmia, fever, respiratory failure, altered mental status, cardiac arrest, and a previous cardiac arrest. The patient is on multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, propofol, famotidine, and other ICU medications.

Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, electrolytes, and liver function tests. However, there are slightly elevated levels of lactate, creatinine, and lipase.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum culture may be necessary.

2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could potentially progress to delirium due to various factors such as sedatives, sepsis, or multi-organ dysfunction. Regular cognitive assessments and appropriate interventions should be implemented.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.

4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections. Frequent monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and surveillance cultures may help in early detection and management.

5. Cardiac dysrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac dysrhythmias and recent cardiac arrest suggest the possibility of recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring and appropriate antiarrhythmic medications may be required.

6. Fluid balance and renal function: Close attention should be given to the patient's fluid balance and renal function due to potential fluid overload and the use of nephrotoxic medications. Daily weight measurements, urine output monitoring, and serial creatinine levels can help in assessing renal function.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by the healthcare team is necessary to confirm and manage these risks appropriately."

   upgoing toe and some resistence with movement of extremities. Pt not
   brain dead as breathing sponaneously. EEG and head CT without new
   pathology. No improvement today, but on propofol currently
   - Neuro believes virtually chance of a meaningful recovery, and a very
   high chance of death within the next year, even with best supportive
   measures
   - will f/u w/ Neuro recs
   #) SVT
 No additional SVT since starting amiodarone gtt
   - Will continue amiodrone po for now, decrease dose given bradycardia
   overnight
   - replace mg prn
   #) Respiratory Failure: likely aspiration pneumonitis. w/ CXR now is
   concerning for a retrocardiac opacity as well as increase interstitial
   fluid. On pressure support [**4-20**], RSBI 40 without significant secretions.
   - continue zosyn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and dependent at baseline. He presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest and is currently on hypothermia protocol. 

The patient has been diagnosed with the following medical conditions:
1) AMS (Altered Mental Status) likely due to anoxic brain injury following the cardiac arrest. The patient shows some signs of movement resistance and an upgoing toe, indicating possible neurological deficits. However, he is not brain dead as he is breathing spontaneously. An EEG and head CT have been performed without showing any new pathology. The patient is currently on propofol.
2) SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia) for which amiodarone has been started. The patient's heart rate has stabilized, and the dose of amiodarone will be decreased due to bradycardia.
3) Respiratory Failure, likely caused by aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's chest X-ray shows a retrocardiac opacity and increased interstitial fluid. He is currently on pressure support with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 40 without significant secretions. Antibiotics (zosyn) are being continued, and the plan is to extubate the patient at 8 pm on the next day. No plans for a tracheostomy or feeding tube have been made if the patient fails extubation.

The patient's vital signs include"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic subdural hematoma, Parkinson's disease, and dependent in activities of daily living. He presented after a cardiac arrest and is currently on a hypothermia protocol. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient has anoxic brain injury due to the cardiac arrest. The neurological examination shows some signs of brain dysfunction, such as right upgoing toe and resistance with movement of extremities. The EEG and head CT did not show any new pathology, but there is no improvement today. The neurologist believes that the chance of a meaningful recovery is low, and there is a high chance of death within the next year even with best supportive measures.

2. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient experienced SVT, but no additional episodes have occurred since starting amiodarone. The dose of amiodarone will be decreased due to bradycardia.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing aspiration pneumonitis, as evidenced by the concern for a retrocardiac opacity on the chest X-ray and increased interstitial fluid. The patient is on pressure support and has a respiratory system compliance of 40 without significant secretions. Continuous zosyn will be continued.

4. Code status: The patient's code status is currently DNR (do not resuscitate"
