 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   .
   .
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neurosurg team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurosurg ~ 1 month.
   - Maintain SBP < 160 with IV meds until mental status improved, then
   change to PO.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs
   .
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output improved
   with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so evening dose of ddAVP was held.
   This morning making 300ccs/hour of urine with .  Endocrine following;
   per note can also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so
   need to watch Na closely.  Appears euvolemic with stable Nas.  Output
   is decreasing.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]??
   - Match output with IVFs as needed -> will increase LR.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  Was
   initially requiring high doses on insulin, now on ~5/hr.  Not eating
   well yet.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - Now on subcu regimen, with long-acting lantus, prandial humalog and
   humalog sliding scale.
   - needs insulin teaching if ?planning on eventual DC home.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved since this AM, though still quite lethargic. Per
   neurosurgery, has been this way since very beginning of course.
   Normoglycemic.  Nonfocal on neuro checks.  Last head CT stable on
   [**10-29**].
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input.
   - Continue neurochecks.
   - Will discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time.
   - ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   .
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed - somewhat
   limited, though with frequent desaturations to 60's.  Started on CPAP
   at night with oxygen during the day (as sleeping frequently.   Probably
   mixed central and obstructive.  Macroglossia on exam likely
   contributing to obstructive component.
   - continue CPAP on autoset with supplemental O2.
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - will discuss with sleep re: possible devices for management of
   central apnea as well (oscillator or CPAP with dead space).
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Elevated WBCs since surgery.  New fever to 100.8
   today.
   - Culture.
   - Recheck CXR in AM.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now.
   - Monitor surgical site.
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: full
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: ICU for now, plan to send to floor once off insulin gtt and

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and pituitary macroadenoma who underwent a craniotomy and decompression. He is currently in the ICU for continued endocrine management.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Diabetes Mellitus Type I (DM): The patient has hyperglycemia and features of acromegaly, which may be related to the pituitary macroadenoma. Insulin therapy is being used to control blood glucose levels.

2. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has altered mental status and gag reflex, putting him at risk for aspiration and airway compromise. Airway clearance and cough reflexes need to be monitored.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, requiring insulin therapy. Monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.

4. Lethargy: The patient is lethargic but has shown some improvement since the morning. Neurological checks are being conducted, and further evaluation by neurosurgery is needed.

5. Central/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient has desaturations during sleep, indicating possible sleep apnea. CPAP therapy has been initiated, and further recommendations from sleep specialists are pending.

6. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and new fever, suggesting a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained"

   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  This morning making 300ccs/hour of
   urine with increased hyponatremia.  Endocrine following; per note can
   also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so need to watch
   Na closely.  Today we will restart ddAVP to decrease fluid output, with
   the plan to limit the amount of free water to tree hyponatremia.  We
   will try having him meet his fluid demands himself with free access to
   water.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.

   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  He
   may have decreasing insulin requirements after his body equilibrates
   with lower glucose levels.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - Now on subcu regimen, with long-acting lantus, prandial humalog and
   humalog sliding scale.
   - If he leaves on sub-cu insulin, which is likely given his high doses
   of insulin, he will need significant teaching to allow for home
   management.

   # Lethargy.  Improved now that he was sitting up in chair with less
   lethargy but he still gave mostly monosyllabic answers.  Unclear
   whether language barrier plays a role
 last night he did not give more
   info with interpreter. Per neurosurgery, has been this way since very
   beginning of course.
   - Discuss with family how his current status compares to his baseline.
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input if no source can be found with data gathering.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of little significance, presenting with hyperglycemia and features of acromegaly. He was found to have a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension, which underwent decompression through craniotomy. The patient is currently in the MICU service for continued endocrine management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has hyperglycemia likely secondary to a growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumor or more classic DM II. His HA1C level was 17 during admission.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy as recommended by the endocrinology team.

3. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance due to his condition, putting him at risk for aspiration.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient had hyponatremia after the decompression surgery, possibly due to diabetes insipidus (DI) or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary.

5. Lethargy: The patient has been lethargic since the beginning of his course, which may be attributed to the macroadenoma or other factors. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a chief complaint of weakness and a known history of a pituitary macroadenoma. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hyperglycemia, with blood glucose levels ranging from 140 to 295 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures were drawn, and antibiotics were initiated. The endocrinologist decided to hold the administration of desmopressin (ddAVP) and will reassess in the morning. Steroids were lowered to 50mg IV every 8 hours, and insulin was started as a sliding scale with basal/bolus regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/57 to 109/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an overall fluid balance of -445 mL since midnight. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal electrolyte levels. The patient's kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by an increased creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

   neurosurg team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurosurg ~ 1 month.
   - Maintain SBP < 160 with IV meds until mental status improved, then
   change to PO.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs.
   .
   # Diabetes insipidus.  Likely due to recent decompression.  Unclear if
   was exhibiting signs of DI prior to surgery (output now well recorded
   on the floor) - was having polydipsia/polyuria but also had increased
   glucoses and likely osmotic diuresis.  Endocrine following; per note
   can also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so need to
   watch Na closely.  Appears euvolemic with stable Nas.  Output is
   decreasing.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Match output with IVFs as needed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  Was
   initially requiring high doses on insulin, now on ~5/hr.  Not eating
   well yet.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will continue on insulin gtt for now, with plan to transition to
   subcutaneous regimen possibly tonight.  Was previously on ~80 lantus
   with 15 of humalog plus sliding scale.
   - needs insulin teaching if ?planning on eventual DC home.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved since this AM, though still quite lethargic. Per
   neurosurgery, has been this way since very beginning of course.
   Normoglycemic.  Nonfocal on neuro checks.  Last head CT stable on
   [**10-29**].
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input.
   - Continue neurochecks.
   - Will discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time.
   - ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   .
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed - somewhat
   limited, though with frequent desaturations to 60's.  Started on CPAP
   at night with oxygen during the day (as sleeping frequently.   Probably
   mixed central and obstructive.  Macroglossia on exam likely
   contributing to obstructive component.
   - continue CPAP on autoset with supplemental O2.
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - will discuss with sleep re: possible devices for management of
   central apnea as well (oscillator or CPAP with dead space).
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Elevated WBCs since surgery.  New fever to 100.8
   today.
   - Culture.
   - Recheck CXR in AM.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now.
   - Monitor surgical site.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. The patient underwent craniotomy and decompression on [**10-28**] and is now stable from a surgical standpoint. There are no plans for further surgical intervention, and radiation therapy may be considered in the future. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including diabetes mellitus type I, hyperglycemia, inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, impaired airway clearance, cough), diabetes insipidus (likely due to recent decompression), hypernatremia, lethargy, central/obstructive sleep apnea, and fever/leukocytosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression. Presenting with DM and high insulin requirements and clinical features of acromegaly. Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recommendations and follow up with IGF1 and [**Hospital1**] levels.
2. Diabetes insipidus. Likely due to recent decompression. Continue to monitor sodium levels closely, match output with IV fluids as needed, and administer ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1**].
3. Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone-secreting pit"

   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neuro [**Doctor First Name **] team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.

   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over yesterday was making a large amt
   of urine (500-600 per hour) but has decreased to <100/hr earlier this
   am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has been balanced mostly with PO
   intake.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - F/u Endo recs re: further ddAVP
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   - Need to f/u with NSurg re: when can initiate given recent surgery

   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.
   - hold off on ABx for now

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of little significance presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and found to have a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. The patient underwent craniotomy and decompression for the pituitary adenoma on [**10-28**]. He is currently being managed in the MICU service for continued endocrine management.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance and electrolytes need close monitoring due to the recent decompression surgery and the risk of developing diabetes insipidus (DI) or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

2. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has hyperglycemia secondary to a likely growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumor. He requires ongoing endocrine follow-up and education regarding diabetes management.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, but his HbA1c level during admission was 17, indicating poor long-term glycemic control. Ongoing monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy will be necessary.

4. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy needs further evaluation, considering the recent pituitary adenoma and its potential impact on hormone regulation.

   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over yesterday was making a large amt
   of urine (500-600 per hour) but has decreased to <100/hr earlier this
   am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has been balanced mostly with PO
   intake.
   - Will get pm urine and serum lytes, f/u UOP through the day, and
   reassess need for further ddAVP
   - F/u Endo recs re: further ddAVP
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   - Need to f/u with NSurg re: when can initiate given recent surgery
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.
   - hold off on ABx for now
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression on [**10-28**] and is now stable from a surgical standpoint. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), electrolyte and fluid disorder, diabetes mellitus type I (DM), hyperglycemia, and airway inability to protect. 

He is currently on several medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, and insulin. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he is lethargic and has difficulty awakening. His physical examination reveals noisy sleeping and snoring, with rhonchi in the lungs and poor air movement. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, low sodium levels, and high blood glucose levels. Imaging studies indicate a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing endocrine management, monitoring of IGF1 levels, follow-up with an endocrinologist, and continued steroid therapy. He also requires management for diabetes insipidus/SIADH, hyperglycemia, and central/obstructive sleep apnea. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of his electrolyte imbalance, uncontrolled diabetes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression on [**10-28**]. Currently, he is in the MICU service for continued endocrine management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has central/obstructive sleep apnea, as indicated by a sleep study showing periodic breathing with central apnea. He would benefit from oxygen at night and positive pressure therapy.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient initially had hypernatremia with polyuria consistent with diabetes insipidus due to recent decompression. His urine output decreased with desmopressin (ddAVP) but then became hyponatremic. His fluid balance is mostly maintained with PO intake.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has hyperglycemia secondary to a likely growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumor. His blood sugars were well-controlled yesterday, but further evaluation and management by endocrinology are needed.
4. Lethargy: The patient was normal until a month ago when these symptoms started. Endocrine evaluation is needed to determine if the pituitary adenoma is causing the lethargy.
5. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient remains afebrile, and leukocytosis has improved without any focal source of infection. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been withheld for now.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to his limited mobility.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis.
8. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on H2 blocker prophylaxis.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. Rehabilitation Consult: The patient needs a physical therapy and occupational therapy consult to gauge whether he will require rehabilitation services upon discharge.

Please note that the potential medical complications listed above are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and management by the respective specialists are necessary to address these complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient underwent resection of a suprasellar mass and is currently in the ICU. The patient is lethargic and unable to provide a history. They have a history of thyroid disease and pituitary resection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 138/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on multiple medications, including DDAVP, famotidine, and heparin. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels but are otherwise within normal ranges. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are also within normal limits. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated. 

The assessment and plan include obstructive sleep apnea, electrolyte and fluid disorder, diabetes mellitus type I, and altered mental status. The patient continues to have copious urine that responds to DDAVP. The major issue now is the patient's lethargy, which is likely due to obstructive sleep apnea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's lethargy and potential obstructive sleep apnea, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, there is an increased"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Became hyponatremic to 129 after
   receiving 1mcg ddAVP yesterday.  Did not get a second dose and since
   midnight has been making 500 to 700 ccs of urine an hour.  We still
   think that he has diabetes insipidus secondary to his surgery.  Our
   plan now is to try giving ddAVP, but to fluid restrict him afterwards
   to prevent hyponatremia.  We will also stop giving him IV fluids as
   these may be preventing him from self regulating.  We will also consult
   the renal service to get their input on how to manage this complex
   patient.
   - renal consult
   - Appreciate endocrine recs.
   - Give 1 mcg of ddAVP and restrict to 2L of PO intake afterwards.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Fever/bacteremia: had [**2-1**] positive blood cultures for gram positive
   cocci in clusters.  The induration in his left-sided antecubital fossa
   is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis and a possible source
   for his positive blood cultures.  He continues to be afebrile with a
   decreasing WBC count, making high-grade bacteremia unlikely.  On day 2
   of vanco and awaiting speciation.  Staph aureus vs epidermis.
   - consult vascular to evaluate this possible.
   - RUE ultrasound to assess for DVT or abscess.
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  If culture is sensitive, will
   consider changing to nafcillin.
   - if staph aureus, consult ID
   - induration on left arm could be a potential source.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. 

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient is experiencing intermittent hyponatremia and polyuria, which indicates a possible disturbance in sodium and water balance. This may be due to diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to pituitary surgery. The patient's high urine output and large fluid intake could contribute to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. This could be related to superficial thrombophlebitis in the antecubital fossa or a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Further evaluation and treatment are necessary.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an indurated cord underneath a white pustule in the left antecubital fossa, which raises suspicion for superficial thrombophlebitis. This condition increases the risk of developing DVT. An ultrasound of the right extremity is ordered to assess for DVT or abscess.

4. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient has lethargy and a history of sleep apnea, as evidenced by a sleep study showing frequent desaturations. OSA can lead to respiratory complications and should be managed appropriately.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus type I due"

   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Became hyponatremic to 129 after

    Had been hypernatremic with polyuria consistent with DI due to recent
   decompression.  Urine output decreased to a more manageable amount with
   ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over
   yesterday was making a large amt of urine (500-600 per hour) but has
   decreased to <100/hr earlier this am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has
   been balanced mostly with PO intake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression. The patient is currently experiencing polyuria, intermittent hyponatremia, and persistent somnolence.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), electrolyte and fluid disorder, diabetes mellitus (DM) type I, altered mental status, and hyperglycemia. The patient's blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, and he is currently on Humalog 20 units per day and Lantus 65 units per day.

The patient also has a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating possible bacteremia. The source of infection has not been identified yet. The patient is currently on vancomycin and awaiting speciation of the bacteria.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -438 mL over the past 24 hours. His urine output has been variable, ranging from 500 to 700 mL per hour earlier in the morning but decreased to less than 100 mL per hour after receiving 1 mcg of ddAVP. His serum sodium levels have been fluctuating, with a high of 137 mEq/L and a low of 129 mEq/L.

   - On our bedside LUE U/S, patient appears to have a non-compressible
   portion of vein at the site of the induration, consistent with
   thrombophlebitis.
   - Endocrine recs: Hold ddAVP if Na<133, watch out for SIADH which
   typically happens around day 7 post-op.  Reduce hydrocortisone to 25mg
   IV Q8hrs.
   - Renal recs: hold ddAVP and fluid restrict patient after midnight to
   see what his set point will be.  If sodium rises rapidly or becomes
   hypotensive, stop water deprivation.  If UO continues to be high after
   water deprivation, then give ddAVP.
   - At midnight 6.3L negative for the day! UOP still 450-600ccs per hour.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Tried trial of fluid restriction without
   ddAVP overnight.  Continued to have very high urine outputs and is now
   negative almost 9 liters in the last 30 hours, with a sodium of 140 and
   very dilute urine.  We are nearly certain from this that he has
   diabetes insipidus.  Given that he is not yet at a sodium level that
   would necessarily limit his urine output, we will fluid restrict him
   further until noon, and then recheck his blood and urine sodium before
   starting ddAVP.  We will then plan on 1mcg of ddAVP [**Hospital1 **], with a plan to
   reduce to one dose daily or a lower dose if his sodium goes low again.
   - appreciate renal and endocrine recs for this complex case.
   - Likely give 1 mcg ddAVP starting after noon today.
   - No IV fluids, with the plan of letting him self-regulate.
   - Lytes at noon and then in late afternoon.
   # Fever/bacteremia: staph epi in blood, now appears to have been in one
   bottle only.  Sensitivities pending.  Unclear whether this is a
   contaminant or seeded from superficial thrombophlebitis.  On day 3 of
   vancomycin.  Our U/S certainly suggested a superficial
   thrombophlebitis.  We will check with vascular surgery whether they
   would prefer to simply treat with vanco or actually remove the infected
   superficial vein.
   - talk to vascular
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  f/u sensitivities.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Discuss with neuro whether Q8hr neuro checks could be appropriate.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Hydrocortisone 25mg PO q8 this am
   # Hyperglycemia.  Sugars generally in 100s except for one time at 65
   yesterday at 11am.  We will decrease his humalog dose with meals to 15
   units and follow.  Continue Glargine 65 units QHS.  He will need
   DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Much improved today, and may have been partly related to
   recovery from his surgery.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he
   is profoundly apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP
   in one month once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to
   tolerate positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a
   month ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and
   ambulation.
   - Encourage OOB
   - PT will work with him here and feel that he does not need home PT.

   - LUE u/s: negative for clot. Not clear if they assessed for an
   abscess.  Radiologist will f/u with tech and call back in AM.
   - On our bedside echo, patient appears to have a non-compressible
   portion of vein at the site of the induration, consistent with
   thrombophlebitis.
   - Endocrine recs: Hold ddAVP if Na<133, watch out for SIADH which
   typically happens around day 7 post-op.  Reduce hydrocortisone to 25mg
   IV Q8hrs.
   - Renal recs: hold ddAVP and fluid restrict patient after midnight to
   see what his set point will be.  If sodium rises rapidly or becomes
   hypotensive, stop water deprivation.  If UO continues to be high after
   water deprivation, then give ddAVP.
   - At midnight 6.3L negative for the day! UOP still 450-600ccs per hour.
   - IV access - PICC team thought U/S was to assess for clot, and

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Tried trial of fluid restriction without
   ddAVP overnight.  Continued
   Became hyponatremic to 129 after receiving 1mcg ddAVP yesterday.  Did
   not get a second dose and since midnight has been making 500 to 700 ccs
   of urine an hour.  We still think that he has diabetes insipidus
   secondary to his surgery.  Our plan now is to try giving ddAVP, but to
   fluid restrict him afterwards to prevent hyponatremia.  We will also
   stop giving him IV fluids as these may be preventing him from self
   regulating.  We will also consult the renal service to get their input
   on how to manage this complex patient.
   - renal consult
   - Appreciate endocrine recs.
   - Give 1 mcg of ddAVP and restrict to 2L of PO intake afterwards.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Fever/bacteremia: had [**2-1**] positive blood cultures for gram positive
   cocci in clusters.  The induration in his left-sided antecubital fossa
   is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis and a possible source
   for his positive blood cultures.  He continues to be afebrile with a
   decreasing WBC count, making high-grade bacteremia unlikely.  On day 2
   of vanco and awaiting speciation.  Staph aureus vs epidermis.
   - consult vascular to evaluate this possible.
   - RUE ultrasound to assess for DVT or abscess.
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  If culture is sensitive, will
   consider changing to nafcillin.
   - if staph aureus, consult ID
   - induration on left arm could be a potential source.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 65 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he is profoundly
   apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP in one month
   once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to tolerate
   positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a month
   ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and ambulation.
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet
   # PPX: H2 blocker, bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV.  Has difficult access.  Placed order for PICC, but has
   had positive cultures.  Will see if this is possible.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension that underwent craniotomy and decompression. The patient's current medical conditions include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), superficial thrombophlebitis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, type I diabetes mellitus (DM), altered mental status (not delirium), and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Central/obstructive sleep apnea: The patient has profound apneic episodes at night, and initiating night CPAP may be beneficial once he has recovered sufficiently from surgery.
2. Superficial thrombophlebitis: The induration in the left-sided antecubital fossa could be a potential source for positive blood cultures. It is important to consult vascular services to evaluate this possible superficial thrombophlebitis and assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or abscess.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient requires close monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance due to ongoing polyuria, intermittent hyponatremia, and persistent somnolence. Fluid restriction and administration of desmopressin (ddAVP) may be necessary to manage diabetes insipidus and prevent hyponatremia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled blood sugars and requires endocrine follow-up for further management of his diabetes mellitus.
5. Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression: The patient had a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension removed during craniotomy. Long-term management may include radiation therapy and hormone replacement therapy.
6. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy is likely related to sleep apnea, and it is important to encourage out-of-bed activity and consider physical therapy/occupational therapy consultation for rehabilitation.
7. Fever/bacteremia: Although the patient is currently afebrile, previous positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters indicate a possible infection. Continuing vancomycin and consulting vascular services to evaluate the induration on the left arm are recommended.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and address these potential complications to ensure optimal care and prevent any further complications."

   IV Q8hrs.
   - Renal recs: hold ddAVP and fluid restrict patient after midnight to
   see what his set point will be.  If sodium rises rapidly or becomes
   hypotensive, stop water deprivation.  If UO continues to be high after
   water deprivation, then give ddAVP.
   - At midnight 6.3L negative for the day! UOP still 450-600ccs per hour.
   - IV access - PICC team thought U/S was to assess for clot, and
   therefore put off PICC pending final radiology read which didn't come
   until 5pm. They will reassess in AM.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues. Here is a summary of the key points:

1. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), superficial thrombophlebitis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, type I diabetes mellitus, and altered mental status.

2. Recent events include an ultrasound that was negative for clot but unclear about assessing for abscess. A bedside echo showed a non-compressible portion of vein at the site of induration, consistent with thrombophlebitis.

3. Endocrine recommendations include holding ddAVP if sodium levels are below 133, watching out for SIADH typically occurring around day 7 post-op, reducing hydrocortisone to 25mg IV every 8 hours, and monitoring for fluid retention.

4. Renal recommendations involve holding ddAVP and restricting fluids after midnight to see the patient's set point. If sodium rises rapidly or if the patient becomes hypotensive, stopping water deprivation is advised. If urine output continues to be high after water deprivation, then giving ddAVP is recommended.

5. The patient has been receiving IV access through a PICC line, but it was delayed due to the uncertainty regarding the ultrasound results. The team reassessed in the morning.

6. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging"
