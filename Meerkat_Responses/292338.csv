   49 y.o woman with h.o HIT, HTN, HL, sarcoid, chronic pancreatitis,
   angioectasia of the GI tract, anemia, epilepsy who presents with
   fever/chills, SOB, HCT drop.
   .
   #anemia- Pt's baseline HCt appears to be 26-30. 27 ~3wks ago, currently
   16.3. Likely secondary to bleeding, could be a slow GIB given h.o
   angioectasias and guaiac +stool. Other possibilities include
   intrathoracic/abdominal bleeding given L.sided chest pain. In addition,
   pt is s/p HD tunnel line placement yesterday, possible bleeding related
   to procedure. RP bleed or rectus sheath are possibilities but appear
   unlikely at this time.
   -GI aware plan for ?scope in am.
   -q4hr HCTs for today.
   -2 large bore PIVs, HD catheter
   -active T+C
   -[**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   -guaiac stools.
   -npo
   -if not bumping appropriately will plan to scan thorax/abd for source
   of bleeding.
   .
   #fever/chills-Likely related to infection. Possibly sources include
   HDline given recent insertion. In addition, pt is s/p recent chronic PD
   so SBP is a possibility. Other possibilities include PNA, UTI, abscess
   etc. Pt without focal lung/cxr findings. U/A negative.
   -bcx, ucx
   -trend wbc cont/fever curve
   -broad spectrum abx at this time, pending cx data with
   vanco/zosyn/levo.
   -consider removal of line if thought to be source.
   .
   #SOB-unclear etiology. Pt is sating well on RA. Possibilities include
   anemia, PE, PNA, bronchitis/ URI, sarcoid, cardiogenic causes. Pt with
   recent increase in chronic cough. CXR without infiltrate however pt s/p
   fever can consider PNA. Will have to consider PE in this pt as well.
   However, cannot be anticoagulated with heparin products.
   -consider CTA vs. V/Q scan if suspect PE, for now LENIs to r/o DVt.
   -transfuse to goal of 25
   -infectious w/u.
   -abx to cover for ?PNA/bronchitis given recent cough/sob.
   -nebs
   -consider steroids if thought to be related to sarcoid.
   .
   #L.sided back pain-unclear etiology. However, given recent HCT drop and
   without clear GI source will have to consider RP or intraabdominal
   bleed. Pt also s/p HD line placement.
   -consider imaging for inappropriate HCT bump or continued/worsening
   pain.
   -pain control
   .
   #ESRD-Pt [**Name (NI) 6474**] formerly on PD, supposed to start HD tomorrow.
   -renal recs/aware plan for HD tomorrow pm.
   -monitor lytes/vol status
   -renagel
   .
   #HTN-hold anti-htn for now given bleed. Will resume once stable.
   -on losartan, lasix, nifedipine/holding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sarcoidosis, chronic pancreatitis, angioectasia of the gastrointestinal tract, anemia, and epilepsy. She presents with fever, chills, shortness of breath, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration. The patient has multiple medical complications, including bleeding, infection, and respiratory issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly, indicating possible bleeding. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding related to angioectasias, intrathoracic or abdominal bleeding, or bleeding from the recent dialysis catheter placement.

2. Infection: The patient has symptoms of fever and chills, which may indicate an infection. Possible sources of infection include the newly inserted dialysis line, recent chronic peritoneal dialysis, or other sources such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or abscesses.

3. Respiratory Issues: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath with unclear etiology. Possibilities include anemia, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, bronchitis, or sarcoid-related causes. Considering the recent increase in chronic cough, pneumonia should be considered. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan may be needed to rule out pulmonary embolism, as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis, angioectasia syndrome, anemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She presented to the ICU on day #1 with fever/chills, shortness of breath (SOB), and a drop in hematocrit (Hct). The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, fever/chills, SOB, and ESRD. She is currently receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct was appropriately bumped from 16 to 27 following the transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The etiology of anemia is suspected to be slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to angioectasias, potentially worsened by uremic platelets. Traumatic line placement is also a consideration. Hemolysis is less likely.
2. Fever/Chills: The patient was afebrile overnight without leukocytosis or other signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). She continues to be treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin. There is no culture data supporting infection, and peritoneal fluid is negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A new source of infection is unlikely, but it should be monitored.
3. SOB: The patient's SO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory distress, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. The patient has been transfused overnight and is currently on antibiotics. She has a history of heparin agents allergy, thrombocytopenia, augmentin allergy, lisinopril allergy, and metoprolol allergy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm (with a range of 79-93 bpm), blood pressure of 128/81 mmHg (with a range of 92-172/118-127 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (with a range of 19-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and anemia. This condition requires prompt management to prevent further bleeding and to address the resulting anemia.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which may be due to pulmonary hypertension and/or fluid overload. This can compromise the patient's oxygenation and ventilation, leading to potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

The patient's fever and chills are likely due to an infection, but no specific source has been identified. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath have improved with hemodialysis (HD). The patient is also experiencing left back pain, which has unclear etiology, possibly related to recent HD line placement. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires ongoing HD. The patient's blood pressure is uncontrolled, so antihypertensives are being held. The patient has a history of epilepsy and is being continued on home medications for it.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding due to angioectasias.
2. Infection due to prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Hypotension or fluid overload during hemodialysis.
4. Uremic symptoms due to inadequate renal function.
5. Complications related to indwelling lines, such as infection or bleeding.
6. Poor glycemic control in the ICU setting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis and angioectasias, presenting to the ICU with fever, chills, shortness of breath, and a drop in hematocrit. She has chronic renal failure and is currently undergoing hemodialysis. She also has gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and epilepsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia - The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 27 to 24, indicating ongoing blood loss or hemolysis. The etiology is suspected to be slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to angioectasias, worsened by uremic platelets. The goal is to maintain a hematocrit above 25 with serial measurements every 8 hours. She has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells and should receive further transfusions as needed.
2. Fever/Chills - The patient was initially febrile with chills, but remained afebrile overnight without leukocytosis or other signs of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). She is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin. There is no evidence of infection from the culture data or peritoneal fluid analysis, making it unlikely that the fever is due to a new source of infection. The trend of WBC count and fever curve should be monitored.
